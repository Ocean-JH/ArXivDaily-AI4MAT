### 1. Building-Block Aware Generative Modeling for 3D Crystals of Metal Organic Frameworks

**Authors:** Chenru Duan, Aditya Nandy, Sizhan Liu, Yuanqi Du, Liu He, Yi Qu, Haojun Jia, Jin-Hu Dou

**Published:** 2025-05-13

**Category:** physics.chem-ph

**ID:** 2505.08531v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08531v1)

**Summary:** Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and
topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical
design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate
promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are
restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion
(BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D
all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding
crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database,
BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms
with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental
databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented
metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of
magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was
synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2
sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical
pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs....

### 2. AI-accelerated Discovery of Altermagnetic Materials

**Authors:** Ze-Feng Gao, Shuai Qu, Bocheng Zeng, Yang Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Hao Sun, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu

**Published:** 2023-11-08

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2311.04418v4

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04418v4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04418v4)

**Summary:** Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and
experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many
exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic
materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types
of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a
comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new
applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage
devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a
unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered
by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn
the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by
fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the
altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we
successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals,
semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic
structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics
reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly
discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr
effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave
altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine
performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic
materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated
discovery of the materials with targeted properties....
