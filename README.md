**Summary:** Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding
challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property
relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable
models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density
$w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a
minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated
dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed
Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from
available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we
systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using
combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final
closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive
accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while
maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design
maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and
$P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive
elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type
hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite
trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare
candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to
the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models
indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching
these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for
materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery
of materials in complex chemical spaces....
