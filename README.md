### 1. Machine Learning - Driven Materials Discovery: Unlocking Next-Generation Functional Materials - A review

**Authors:** Dilshod Nematov, Mirabbos Hojamberdiev

**Published:** 2025-03-22

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2503.18975v3

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18975v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18975v3)

**Summary:** The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence
(AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property
prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and
accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview
of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in
predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing
material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning,
graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models
(GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with
tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and
H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning,
and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials
informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and
high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid
synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost
of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of
automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical,
and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in
superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also
address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the
integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future
advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and
computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and
optimized. This synergy paves the way for new innovations in energy,
electronics, and nanotechnology....

### 2. EAC-Net: Predicting real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions

**Authors:** Xuejian Qin, Taoyuze Lv, Zhicheng Zhong

**Published:** 2025-08-06

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2508.04052v3

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04052v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04052v3)

**Summary:** Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully
defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with
high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models
are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.
Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which
couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and
basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1%
error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems.
Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model
covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot
performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training
distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure
calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities,
EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure
prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery....

### 3. CrystalGym: A New Benchmark for Materials Discovery Using Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Prashant Govindarajan, Mathieu Reymond, Antoine Clavaud, Mariano Phielipp, Santiago Miret, Sarath Chandar

**Published:** 2025-09-27

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2509.23156v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23156v1)

**Summary:** In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications....
