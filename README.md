**Summary:** Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific
problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but
instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of
constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To
this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and
property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our
crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a
compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves
computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors.
Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer
which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding
symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards
desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training
techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way
for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials....
