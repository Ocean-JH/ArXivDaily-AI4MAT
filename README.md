**Summary:** In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a
Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative
structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable
accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property
prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular
reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen
as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched
with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning
is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity,
chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then
used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is
employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising
fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the
limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex
structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation.
The generative model can be adapted to different target properties, enabling
systematic exploration of large chemical spaces relevant to fuel design
applications. Furthermore, the demonstrated framework can be readily extended
by incorporating additional synthesizability criteria to improve applicability
and reliability for de novo design of new fuels....
