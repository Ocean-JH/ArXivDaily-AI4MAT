**Summary:** 2D materials exhibiting in-plane anisotropy enable novel functionality in electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices, yet their availability is generally limited to naturally-occurring low-symmetry van der Waals compounds. Here, we demonstrate an approach to structural engineering in a family of blue-emitting 2D silver phenylchalcogenide semiconductors based on steric interactions among surface-bound organic molecular ligands. By strategically halogenating specific sites of phenyl ligands, we demonstrate dramatic changes to the inorganic AgSe plane in mithrene (silver phenylselenolate, AgSePh). Density functional theory revealed pronounced in-plane electronic anisotropy for direct-gap fluorinated derivatives, while a chlorinated variant exhibited a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. Furthermore, some fluorinated variants displayed strongly polarized absorption and luminescence, accompanied by a 10x enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield. This work establishes a versatile approach for tailoring optoelectronic properties in hybrid semiconductors that is difficult or impossible to achieve in all-inorganic materials alone, offering new opportunities in advanced material design....

### 2. LLM-driven discovery for carbon allotropes with bond-network entropy

**Authors:** Yuzhou Hao, Yujie Liu, Xuejie Li, Turab Lookman, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Sun, Zhibin Gao

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**Summary:** The discovery of novel carbon allotropes with tailored thermal and mechanical properties is critical for advanced thermal management. However, exploring the vast configurational space of carbon using \textit{ab initio} calculations remains computationally prohibitive. Driven by the rich topological landscape of carbon, where the competition between $sp, sp^2,$ and $sp^3$ hybridization states dictates material performance, we establish a closed-loop AI framework to explore this complex configurational space. We introduce a hybridization entropy descriptor to guide the search beyond conventional forms. Here, we establish a closed-loop AI framework that synergizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for structural generation with a Machine Learning Potential (MLP) for accelerated evaluation. Leveraging CrystaLLM to generate candidates and an iteratively refined MLP for high-fidelity validation, we screened thousands of structures to identify several stable allotropes with exotic properties. Specifically, we report ``yne-diamond C$_{12}$'' and ``yne-hex-diamond C$_{8}$'', which exhibit extreme thermal anisotropy and ultralow in-plane shear stiffness arising from their mixed $sp$-$sp^3$ hybridization. Furthermore, we discovered a complex $sp$-$sp^2$-$sp^3$ hybridized C$_{12}$ phase that combines metallic conductivity with an anomalous negative Poisson's ratio. Notably, we identified a superhard phase (C16_3) possessing a calculated Vickers hardness (103.3 GPa) exceeding that of diamond 96 GPa). Microscopic analysis reveals that thermal transport in these materials is governed by the interplay between rigid frameworks and flexible linkers. This work expands the known carbon phase space and demonstrates the efficacy of coupling generative AI with machine learning potentials for the accelerated inverse design of functional materials....

### 3. TXL Fusion: A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework Integrating Chemical Heuristics and Large Language Models for Topological Materials Discovery

**Authors:** Arif Ullah, Rajibul Islam, Ghulam Hussain, Zahir Muhammad, Xiaoguang Li, Ming Yang

**Published:** 2025-11-06

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2511.04068v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04068v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04068v2)

**Summary:** Topological materials--including insulators (TIs) and semimetals (TSMs)--hold immense promise for quantum technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Here, we introduce TXL Fusion, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates chemical heuristics, engineered physical descriptors, and large language model (LLM) embeddings to accelerate the discovery of topological materials. By incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological and quantum materials....

### 4. An Information-theoretic Collective Variable for Configurational Entropy

**Authors:** Ashley Z. Guo, Kaelyn Chang, Nicholas J. Corrente

**Published:** 2026-02-25

**Category:** cond-mat.stat-mech

**ID:** 2602.22440v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22440v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22440v1)

**Summary:** Entropy governs molecular self-assembly, phase transitions, and material stability, yet remains challenging to quantify and directly control in molecular systems. Here, we demonstrate that the computable information density (CID), a data compression-based information theoretic metric, provides an instantaneous general measure of configurational entropy in molecular dynamics simulations, reflecting both local and long-range structural organization. We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions. By establishing entropy as a directly accessible structural metric, this framework lays a foundation for future entropy-driven materials design and optimization strategies....
