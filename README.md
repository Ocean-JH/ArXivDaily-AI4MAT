**Summary:** Electrospinning is a powerful technique for producing micro to nanoscale fibers with application specific architectures. Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software. SpinCastML reduces experimental waste, accelerates discovery, and democratizes access to advanced modeling, establishing distribution aware inverse design as a new standard for sustainable nanofiber manufacturing across biomedical, filtration, and energy applications....
