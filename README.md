### 1. High-Throughput Quantification of Altermagnetic Band Splitting

**Authors:** Ali Sufyan, Brahim Marfoua, J. Andreas Larsson, Erik van Loon, Rickard Armiento

**Published:** 2025-09-18

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2509.14729v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14729v1)

**Summary:** Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism
that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization,
enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This
distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials
composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for
next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and
experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited
due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional
approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the
entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize
altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting
significant spin splitting ($\geq 50$ meV within $\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi
level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our
momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly
across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away
from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future
photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and
elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a
robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in
spintronics and quantum materials discovery....

### 2. S1-MatAgent: A planner driven multi-agent system for material discovery

**Authors:** Xinrui Wang, Chengbo Li, Boxuan Zhang, Jiahui Shi, Nian Ran, Linjing Li, Jianjun Liu, Dajun Zeng

**Published:** 2025-09-18

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2509.14542v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14542v1)

**Summary:** The discovery of high-performance materials is crucial for technological
advancement. Inverse design using multi-agent systems (MAS) shows great
potential for new material discovery. However, current MAS for materials
research rely on predefined configurations and tools, limiting their
adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we developed a
planner driven multi-agent system (S1-MatAgent) which adopts a Planner-Executor
architecture. Planner automatically decomposes complex materials design tasks,
dynamically configures various tools to generate dedicated Executor agents for
each subtask, significantly reducing reliance on manual workflow construction
and specialized configuration. Applied to high-entropy alloy catalysts for
hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions, S1-MatAgent completed
full-cycle closed-loop design from literature analysis and composition
recommendation to performance optimization and experimental validation. To
tackle the deviations between designed materials and target, as well as high
experimental verification costs, S1-MatAgent employs a novel composition
optimization algorithm based on gradients of machine learning interatomic
potential, achieving 27.7 % improvement in material performance. S1-MatAgent
designed 13 high-performance catalysts from 20 million candidates, with
Ni4Co4Cu1Mo3Ru4 exhibiting an overpotential of 18.6 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and
maintaining 97.5 % activity after 500 hours at 500 mA cm-2. The universal MAS
framework offers a universal and scalable solution for material discovery,
significantly improving design efficiency and adaptability....
