**Summary:** Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials
discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental
platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the
features used to model system performance, compromising current and future
campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect
noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and
finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then
performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value
distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy
features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are
conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity
noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean
training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with
continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability
compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic
study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data
recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature
distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in
materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and
experimental precision in automated materials discovery....
