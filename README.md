### 1. Path Entropy-driven Design of Solid-State Electrolytes

**Authors:** Qiye Guan, Kaiyang Wang, Jingjie Yeo, Yongqing Cai

**Published:** 2024-12-10

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2412.07115v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07115v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07115v2)

**Summary:** The development of high-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) has entered a critical stage, where entropy-driven strategies offer transformative potential for enhancing electrochemical properties. By engineering local environments for conductive ions alongside introducing disorder, these approaches can significantly improve conductivity. However, embracing high-entropy designs does not always guarantee improved performance. Current entropy descriptions oversimplify disorder by accounting solely for host framework configurations, neglecting conductive ion-induced disorder, rendering such descriptions incomplete. Herein, we propose path entropy (Sp) as a descriptor that quantifies diffusion pathway diversity, directly capturing diffusional disorder. Combining Markov state model with transition path theory, we reveal the interplay between diffusion pathway diversity of lithium and microscopic local environments in inorganic thiophosphates. Generalizing this path-informative Sp for high-throughput screening, we demonstrate its broad applicability in identifying and designing high-performance SSEs. Our work establishes a critical link between entropy evolution underlying ion conduction and practical entropy-driven design principles....

### 2. Toward Unified Interphase Engineering: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase in Batteries and Supercapacitors

**Authors:** Mehedi Hasan, Ishtiaq Murshed, Khayrul Islam, A. K. M. Masud

**Published:** 2025-11-28

**Category:** physics.chem-ph

**ID:** 2511.23005v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23005v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23005v1)

**Summary:** The development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage requires devices that combine the high energy density of batteries with the power capability and long cycle life of supercapacitors. However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation. By identifying shared mechanisms and establishing transferable design rules, this unified framework provides a foundation for predictive interphase engineering that supports long-lived, high-performance energy-storage technologies....

### 3. Rapid optimization in high dimensional space by deep kernel learning augmented genetic algorithms

**Authors:** Mani Valleti, Aditya Raghavan, Sergei V. Kalinin

**Published:** 2024-10-04

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2410.03173v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03173v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03173v2)

**Summary:** Exploration of complex high-dimensional spaces presents significant challenges in fields such as molecular discovery, process optimization, and supply chain management. Genetic Algorithms (GAs), while offering significant power for creating new candidate spaces, often entail high computational demands due to the need for evaluation of each new proposed solution. On the other hand, Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) efficiently navigates the spaces of preselected candidate structures but lacks generative capabilities. This study introduces an approach that amalgamates the generative power of GAs to create new candidates with the efficiency of DKL-based surrogate models to rapidly ascertain the behavior of new candidate spaces. This DKL-GA framework can be further used to build Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the optimization of the FerroSIM model, showcasing its broad applicability to diverse challenges, including molecular discovery and battery charging optimization....

### 4. MolEdit: Knowledge Editing for Multimodal Molecule Language Models

**Authors:** Zhenyu Lei, Patrick Soga, Yaochen Zhu, Yinhan He, Yushun Dong, Jundong Li

**Published:** 2025-11-16

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2511.12770v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12770v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12770v2)

**Summary:** Understanding and continuously refining multimodal molecular knowledge is crucial for advancing biomedicine, chemistry, and materials science. Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency.

**Summary:** Understanding structure-property relationships in materials is fundamental in condensed matter physics and materials science. Over the past few years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing this understanding and accelerating materials discovery. Early ML approaches primarily focused on constructing and screening large material spaces to identify promising candidates for various applications. More recently, research efforts have increasingly shifted toward generating crystal structures using end-to-end generative models. This review analyzes the current state of generative modeling for crystal structure prediction and \textit{de novo} generation. It examines crystal representations, outlines the generative models used to design crystal structures, and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the review highlights experimental considerations for evaluating generated structures and provides recommendations for suitable existing software tools. Emerging topics, such as modeling disorder and defects, integration in advanced characterization, and incorporating synthetic feasibility constraints, are explored. Ultimately, this work aims to inform both experimental scientists looking to adapt suitable ML models to their specific circumstances and ML specialists seeking to understand the unique challenges related to inverse materials design and discovery....

### 6. Active flow-driven DNA remodeling generates millimeter-scale mechanical oscillations

**Authors:** Maya Levanon, Noa S. Goldberg, Dvir Cohen, Eran Bouchbinder, Ram M. Adar, Alexandra M. Tayar

**Published:** 2025-11-27

**Category:** cond-mat.soft

**ID:** 2511.22589v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22589v1)

**Summary:** In living systems, DNA undergoes continuous and rhythmic mechanical remodeling through condensation, looping, and disentangling to regulate gene expression, segregate chromosomes, and guide morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a purely mechanical route to rhythmic DNA reorganization in a minimal active composite of microtubules, kinesin motors, and DNA. We embed a DNA polymer in an active turbulent microtubule-kinesin fluid, creating a self-morphing material. The active flows stretch and entangle the DNA, forming a self-organized viscoelastic network that resists active stresses and affects flow over large length scales. This mechanical feedback loop progressively amplifies velocity correlations and drives a nonequilibrium phase transition tuned by DNA contour length: from disordered flow to synchronized, millimeter-scale oscillations with vortices. We rationalize the phase transition with an active-gel model that predicts a growing length scale and an oscillatory instability emerging from the interplay between activity, orientational order, and self-generated viscoelasticity, rather than chemical signaling. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on system size and activity quantitatively agrees with experiment. Thus, flow-driven DNA remodeling provides a minimal physical route to autonomous, system-spanning oscillations in three dimensions and suggests design principles for programmable soft matter that coordinates, actuates, and reshapes itself....

### 7. Integration of 2D Materials in Radial van der Waals Heterostructure Metasurfaces

**Authors:** Connor Heimig, Jonas Biechteler, Cristina Cruciano, Armando Genco, Thomas Weber, Michael Hirler, Dmytro Gryb, Alexander A. Antonov, Leonardo de S. Menezes, Gianluca Valentini, Cristian Manzoni, Giulio Cerullo, Stefan A. Maier, Luca Sortino, Andreas Tittl

**Category:** physics.optics

**ID:** 2511.22410v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22410v1)

**Summary:** Two-dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), exhibit strong excitonic transitions at room temperature and offer a unique platform for exploring light-matter interactions in nanoscale photonic systems. In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $μm^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling. This work establishes a scalable approach for generating hybrid photonic-excitonic states with momentum-space structure, offering new opportunities for exciton localization, valley emission, spatially programmable light-matter interaction in two-dimensional material platforms and compact luminescent devices based on 2D material-integrated metasurfaces....

### 8. Swarms of Large Language Model Agents for Protein Sequence Design with Experimental Validation

**Authors:** Fiona Y. Wang, Di Sheng Lee, David L. Kaplan, Markus J. Buehler

**Published:** 2025-11-27

**Category:** cs.AI

**ID:** 2511.22311v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22311v1)

**Summary:** Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks....

### 9. Enhanced Conditional Generation of Double Perovskite by Knowledge-Guided Language Model Feedback

**Authors:** Inhyo Lee, Junhyeong Lee, Jongwon Park, KyungTae Lim, Seunghwa Ryu

**Published:** 2025-11-27

**Category:** cs.AI

**ID:** 2511.22307v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22307v1)

**Summary:** Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies....

### 10. QuantumChem-200K: A Large-Scale Open Organic Molecular Dataset for Quantum-Chemistry Property Screening and Language Model Benchmarking

**Authors:** Yinqi Zeng, Renjie Li

**Published:** 2025-11-23

**Category:** physics.chem-ph

**ID:** 2511.21747v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21747v1)

**Summary:** The discovery of next-generation photoinitiators for two-photon polymerization (TPP) is hindered by the absence of large, open datasets containing the quantum-chemical and photophysical properties required to model photodissociation and excited-state behavior. Existing molecular datasets typically provide only basic physicochemical descriptors and therefore cannot support data-driven screening or AI-assisted design of photoinitiators. To address this gap, we introduce QuantumChem-200K, a large-scale dataset of over 200,000 organic molecules annotated with eleven quantum-chemical properties, including two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, TPA spectral ranges, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) energies, toxicity and synthetic accessibility scores, hydrophilicity, solubility, boiling point, molecular weight, and aromaticity. These values are computed using a hybrid workflow that integrates density function theory (DFT), semi-empirical excited-state methods, atomistic quantum solvers, and neural-network predictors. Using QuantumChem-200K, we fine tune the open-source Qwen2.5-32B large language model to create a chemistry AI assistant capable of forward property prediction from SMILES. Benchmarking on 3000 unseen molecules from VQM24 and ZINC20 demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, and the base Qwen2.5-32B model, particularly for TPA and ISC predictions central to photoinitiator design. QuantumChem-200K and the corresponding AI assistant together provide the first scalable platform for high-throughput, LLM-driven photoinitiator screening and accelerated discovery of photosensitive materials....
