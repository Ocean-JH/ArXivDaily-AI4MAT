**Summary:** Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage
systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and
ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However,
measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain
experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a
unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a
forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both
computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive
molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately
estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation
structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance
and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration,
making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular
mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the
first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design,
demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports
multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently
multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we
experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic
conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework
advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other
complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes....
