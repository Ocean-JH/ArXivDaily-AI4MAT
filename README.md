### 1. Symmetry-aware Conditional Generation of Crystal Structures Using Diffusion Models

**Authors:** Takanori Ishii, Kaoru Hisama, Kohei Shinohara

**Published:** 2026-01-13

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2601.08115v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08115v1)

**Summary:** The application of generative models in crystal structure prediction (CSP) has gained significant attention. Conditional generation--particularly the generation of crystal structures with specified stability or other physical properties has been actively researched for material discovery purposes. Meanwhile, the generative models capable of symmetry-aware generation are also under active development, because space group symmetry has a strong relationship with the physical properties of materials. In this study, we demonstrate that the symmetry control in the previous conditional crystal generation model may not be sufficiently effective when space group constraints are applied as a condition. To address this problem, we propose the WyckoffDiff-Adaptor, which embeds conditional generation within a WyckoffDiff architecture that effectively diffuses Wyckoff positions to achieve precise symmetry control. We successfully generated formation energy phase diagrams while specifying stable structures of particular combination of elements, such as Li--O and Ti--O systems, while simultaneously preserving the symmetry of the input conditions. The proposed method with symmetry-aware conditional generation demonstrates promising results as an effective approach to achieving the discovery of novel materials with targeted physical properties....

### 2. DataScribe: An AI-Native, Policy-Aligned Web Platform for Multi-Objective Materials Design and Discovery

**Authors:** Divyanshu Singh, Doguhan Sarıtürk, Cameron Lea, Md Shafiqul Islam, Raymundo Arroyave, Vahid Attari

**Published:** 2026-01-12

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2601.07966v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07966v1)

**Summary:** The acceleration of materials discovery requires digital platforms that go beyond data repositories to embed learning, optimization, and decision-making directly into research workflows. We introduce DataScribe, an AI-native, cloud-based materials discovery platform that unifies heterogeneous experimental and computational data through ontology-backed ingestion and machine-actionable knowledge graphs. The platform integrates FAIR-compliant metadata capture, schema and unit harmonization, uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling, and native multi-objective multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, enabling closed-loop propose-measure-learn workflows across experimental and computational pipelines. DataScribe functions as an application-layer intelligence stack, coupling data governance, optimization, and explainability rather than treating them as downstream add-ons. We validate the platform through case studies in electrochemical materials and high-entropy alloys, demonstrating end-to-end data fusion, real-time optimization, and reproducible exploration of multi-objective trade spaces. By embedding optimization engines, machine learning, and unified access to public and private scientific data directly within the data infrastructure, and by supporting open, free use for academic and non-profit researchers, DataScribe functions as a general-purpose application-layer backbone for laboratories of any scale, including self-driving laboratories and geographically distributed materials acceleration platforms, with built-in support for performance, sustainability, and supply-chain-aware objectives....
