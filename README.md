**Summary:** Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials
design by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained
property predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is
hindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such
as charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local
minima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these
issues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive
Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and
template-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid
poor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without
retraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional
targets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal
systems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced
with gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five
target properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and
Bayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite
structures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at
which the other methods fail entirely....
