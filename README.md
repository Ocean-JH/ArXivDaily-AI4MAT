### 1. AOT*: Efficient Synthesis Planning via LLM-Empowered AND-OR Tree Search

**Authors:** Xiaozhuang Song, Xuanhao Pan, Xinjian Zhao, Hangting Ye, Shufei Zhang, Jian Tang, Tianshu Yu

**Published:** 2025-09-25

**Category:** cs.AI

**ID:** 2509.20988v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20988v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20988v1)

**Summary:** Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets....

### 2. Discovery Learning accelerates battery design evaluation

**Authors:** Jiawei Zhang, Yifei Zhang, Baozhao Yi, Yao Ren, Qi Jiao, Hanyu Bai, Weiran Jiang, Ziyou Song

**Published:** 2025-08-09

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2508.06985v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06985v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06985v2)

**Summary:** Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery
and engineering innovation....

### 3. AI-Guided Quantum Material Simulator for Education. Case Example: The Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025

**Authors:** Santiago D. Barrionuevo, Myriam H. Aguirre

**Published:** 2025-09-19

**Category:** physics.ed-ph

**ID:** 2509.20372v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20372v1)

**Summary:** Teaching and learning in advanced materials science are often limited by two
barriers: the technical complexity of quantum-mechanical simulations and the
lack of individualized support in inquiry-based education. Here, we introduce
the Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025 (NMC2025), a command-line platform
that integrates a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tutor with
automated simulation workflows. NMC2025 combines large language model (LLM)
guidance, real-time literature feedback, and domain-specific computation to
create an adaptive learning environment. The system includes modular Python
components for material discovery, simulation parameter optimization, and
automated input generation for Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). Grounded in
constructivist pedagogy, the tool enables students to carry out authentic
research tasks such as identifying candidate materials for neuromorphic
memristors or tuning density functional theory (DFT) inputs, while receiving
context-aware explanations from the AI tutor. A case study illustrates how
iterative, AI-guided refinement of hypotheses and calculations enhances both
accuracy and understanding. NMC2025 fosters deeper conceptual insight,
independent exploration, and smooth transfer of research methods into the
classroom. This approach highlights the potential of AI-augmented education to
reduce barriers to complex simulations and to expand access to computational
modeling across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)....
