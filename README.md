### 1. Denoising diffusion models for inverse design of inflatable structures with programmable deformations

**Authors:** Sara Karimi, Nikolaos N. Vlassis

**Summary:** Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material
property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed
configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a
prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear
deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable
aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a
generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large,
nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates
the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric
descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based
representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these
configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and
postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation
setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and
higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce
diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when
inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while
accommodating complex constraints....
