**Summary:** Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to
advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The
defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central
role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal
generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the
symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information
from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a
novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates
crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals
into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1)
the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the
whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry
transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We
also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations,
enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We
showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials
Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and
predicted properties....
