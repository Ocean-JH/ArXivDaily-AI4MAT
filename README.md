**Summary:** In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction
approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally
expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum
mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative
models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more
rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and
periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling
structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a
symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment
Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these
limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on
an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning
structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known
low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the
ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy
for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as
metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials....
