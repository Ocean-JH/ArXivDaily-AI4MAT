### 1. Large Language Models for Superconductor Discovery

**Authors:** Suman Itani, Yibo Zhang, Ranjit Itani, Jiadong Zang

**Published:** 2025-12-11

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2512.10847v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10847v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10847v1)

**Summary:** Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated data extraction and property prediction across materials science, yet their use in superconductivity research remains limited. Here we construct a large experimental database of 78,203 records, covering 19,058 unique compositions, extracted from scientific literature using an LLM-driven workflow. Each entry includes chemical composition, critical temperature, measurement pressure, structural descriptors, and critical fields. We fine-tune several open-source LLMs for three tasks: (i) classifying superconductors vs. non-superconductors, (ii) predicting the superconducting transition temperature directly from composition or structure-informed inputs, and (iii) inverse design of candidate compositions conditioned on target Tc. The fine-tuned LLMs achieve performance comparable to traditional feature-based models and in some cases exceed them, while substantially outperforming their base versions and capturing meaningful chemical and structural trends. The inverse-design model generates chemically plausible compositions, including 28% novel candidates not seen in training. Finally, applying the trained predictors to the GNoME database identifies unreported materials with predicted Tc > 10 K. Although unverified, these candidates illustrate how integrating an LLM-driven workflow can enable scalable hypothesis generation for superconductivity discovery....

### 2. A Generation Framework with Strict Constraints for Crystal Materials Design

**Authors:** Chao Huang, Jiahui Chen, Chen Chen, Chen Chen, Chunyan Chen, Renjie Su, Shiyu Du

**Published:** 2024-11-13

**Category:** cs.AI

**ID:** 2411.08464v3

**Summary:** The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties. In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of supply chain during production....
