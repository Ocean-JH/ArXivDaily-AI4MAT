**Summary:** The synthesis of complex natural products remains one of the grand challenges
of organic chemistry. We present DeepRetro, a major advancement in
computational retrosynthesis that enables the discovery of viable synthetic
routes for complex molecules typically considered beyond the reach of existing
retrosynthetic methods. DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that
tightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic
engines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior
approaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs.
In contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with
the generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity
checks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically
explores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and
expert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro
achieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true
strength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly
complex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated
planning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach
enables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine
collaboration in organic chemistry. Beyond retrosynthesis, DeepRetro represents
a working model for how to leverage LLMs in scientific discovery. We provide a
transparent account of the system's design, algorithms, and human-feedback
loop, enabling broad adaptation across scientific domains. By releasing
DeepRetro as an open-source tool, we aim to empower chemists to tackle
increasingly ambitious synthetic targets, accelerating progress in drug
discovery, materials design, and beyond....
