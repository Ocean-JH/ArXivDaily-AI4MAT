**Summary:** Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials
discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this
work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration
of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds -
against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational
autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established
methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are
stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast,
generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when
sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties
such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of
both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation
screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability
and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including
universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to
substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains
computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward
more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing
baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued
advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of
novel materials that are thermodynamically stable....
