**Summary:** Disordered (amorphous) materials, such as glasses, are emerging as promising
candidates for applications within energy storage, nonlinear optics, and
catalysis. Their lack of long-range order and complex short- and medium-range
orderings, which depend on composition as well as thermal and pressure history,
offer a vast materials design space. To this end, relying on machine learning
methods instead of trial and error is promising, and among these, inverse
design has emerged as a tool for discovering novel materials with desired
properties. Although inverse design methods based on diffusion models have
shown success for crystalline materials and molecules, similar methods
targeting amorphous materials remain less developed, mainly because of the
limited availability of large-scale datasets and the requirement for larger
simulation cells. In this work, we propose and validate an inverse design
method for amorphous materials, introducing AMDEN (Amorphous Material DEnoising
Network), a diffusion model-based framework that generates structures of
amorphous materials. These low-energy configurations are typically obtained
through a thermal motion-driven random search-like process that cannot be
replicated by standard denoising procedures. We therefore introduce an
energy-based AMDEN variant that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo refinement
for generating these relaxed structures. We further introduce several amorphous
material datasets with diverse properties and compositions to evaluate our
framework and support future development....
