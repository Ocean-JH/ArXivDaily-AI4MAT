**Summary:** Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most
generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom
without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative
model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based
descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure
representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network
architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete
generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction,
the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally
present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the
symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff
against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. Code is
available online at https://github.com/httk/wyckoffdiff...
