**Summary:** Novel materials drive progress across applications from energy storage to
electronics. Automated characterization of material structures with machine
learning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in
material design. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive language model
that performs crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data.
The presented model, deCIFer, generates crystal structures in the widely used
Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format and can be conditioned on powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on
high-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use
diffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal
structures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing
challenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative
assessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces
structures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably,
deCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental
diffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for
crystal structure characterization....
