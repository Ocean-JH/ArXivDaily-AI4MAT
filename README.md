**Summary:** Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline
assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard
protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from
experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer
simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long
history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real
space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the
crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this
problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates
obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known
facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context
of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination
polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors
for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be
systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas,
along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex
hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all
crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is
capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals
with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real
Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals
with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires
minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to
the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of
condensed matter physics and computational materials science....
