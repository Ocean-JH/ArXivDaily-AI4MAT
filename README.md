### 1. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design

**Authors:** Zhendong Cao, Lei Wang

**Published:** 2025-04-03

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2504.02367v3

**Summary:** Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design....

### 2. AI-Guided Human-In-the-Loop Inverse Design of High Performance Engineering Structures

**Summary:** Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO....
