### 1. Crystal Structure Prediction with a Geometric Permutation-Invariant Loss Function

**Authors:** Emmanuel Jehanno, Romain Menegaux, Julien Mairal, Sergei Grudinin

**Published:** 2025-08-31

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2509.00832v2

**Summary:** Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD)....

### 2. AI-Assisted Rapid Crystal Structure Generation Towards a Target Local Environment

**Authors:** Osman Goni Ridwan, Sylvain Pitié, Monish Soundar Raj, Dong Dai, Gilles Frapper, Hongfei Xue, Qiang Zhu

**Published:** 2025-06-09

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2506.08224v2

**Summary:** In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction
approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally
expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum
mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative
models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more
rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and
periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling
structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a
symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment
Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these
limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on
an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning
structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known
low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the
ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy
for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as
metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials....
