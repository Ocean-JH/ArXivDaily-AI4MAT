**Summary:** The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new
energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances
in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal
structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling
without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to
identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties.
In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes
multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures
with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate
constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated
by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which
considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a
subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation
process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a
probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of
existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals
strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of
supply chain during production....
