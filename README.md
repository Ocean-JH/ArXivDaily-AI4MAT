### 1. The Moral Consistency Pipeline: Continuous Ethical Evaluation for Large Language Models

**Authors:** Saeid Jamshidi, Kawser Wazed Nafi, Arghavan Moradi Dakhel, Negar Shahabi, Foutse Khomh

**Published:** 2025-12-02

**Category:** cs.CL

**ID:** 2512.03026v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03026v1)

**Summary:** The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems....

### 2. Altermagnetoelectric Spin Field Effect Transistor

**Authors:** Ziye Zhu, Xianzhang Chen, Xunkai Duan, Zhou Cui, Jiayong Zhang, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou

**Published:** 2025-12-02

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2512.02974v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02974v1)

**Summary:** Spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) are promising candidates for low-power spin-based electronics, yet existing realizations that rely on spin-orbit coupling are constrained by limited material choices and short spin-coherence lengths. Here we propose a different operating principle based on multiferroic altermagnets, in which spin splitting is tuned by an electric field through symmetry control rather than conventional spin-orbit physics. Using an effective model combined with quantum transport simulations, we show that the conductance is determined by the degree of matching between the electrically controlled spin texture of the channel and the fixed spin polarization of ferromagnetic contacts, enabling clear ON and OFF states. Remarkably, we also address a long-standing challenge in multiferroic device design: spintronic channels require metallic carriers, whereas ferroelectricity is usually suppressed in metals. We resolve this conflict by imprinting multiferroic altermagnetism into highly conductive materials via the proximity effect. First-principles calculations for graphene on multiferroic vanadium sulfide halides confirm that graphene acquires a ferroelectrically switchable spin splitting while retaining its metallic character. These results establish a practical route to SFET implementation and identify multiferroic altermagnets as a versatile platform for next-generation spintronic devices....

### 3. Adaptive hydrogels with spatiotemporal stiffening using pH-modulating enzymes

**Authors:** Natascha Gray, Zoe Grämiger, André R. Studart, Rafael Libanori

**Published:** 2025-12-02

**Category:** cond-mat.soft

**ID:** 2512.02698v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02698v1)

**Summary:** Adaptive material systems that autonomously respond to external stimuli are crucial for advancing next-generation smart devices. Biological systems achieve autonomous behavior by utilizing chemical energy from out-of-equilibrium reactions to power life-like functions without requiring external energy inputs. Although responsive hydrogels with embedded enzymatic reactions offer a promising platform for implementing adaptive behavior in synthetic systems, previous studies have focused on controlling the supramolecular self-assembly of responsive building blocks rather than modulating network crosslinking. Here, we demonstrate direct enzymatic modulation of crosslinking density in a double-network hydrogel to achieve autonomous self-stiffening in response to a chemical stimulus. Our adaptive system embeds glucose oxidase within a polyacrylamide-alginate double-network hydrogel containing Ca(EDTA)2- complexes that render the crosslinked alginate network pH-responsive through a competitive calcium binding mechanism. Chemical waves emerging from enzymatic reaction activation propagate at speeds ranging from 15 to 44 um/min, driving spatiotemporal mechanical transitions that increase material stiffness by up to 2.1-fold. By integrating signal sensing and chemomechanical transduction within this responsive hydrogel, we realized adaptive behavior that autonomously converts localized chemical inputs into system-wide mechanical outputs. This positions our adaptive hydrogels as promising model systems to guide the design of intelligent materials for soft robotics and biomedical devices....

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16854v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16854v3)

**Summary:** High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: https://github.com/mkhateri/Awesome-MRI-Super-Resolution.

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02561v1)

**Summary:** With the rapid development of the online education and large language model, the existing educational tools still suffer from incomplete service, insufficient performance and weak interactivity in terms of courseware generation, interactive notes and quality assurance of content. In particular, the proposed generative agent EZYer : 1) Teacher Module: Integrating the Text Corpus retrieval and in-depth generation technologies, it automatically generates structured teaching materials and LaTeX Beamer courseware in line with the high school mathematics syllabus and supports user-defined image insertion. 2) Student Module: Throughout the collaborative interaction of the four roles of Teacher, Assistant, Top Student and Struggling Student, Note Taker summarizes and generates academic notes to enhance the depth and interest of learning. 3) Controller: set up keyword filtering system, content scoring system, role co-validation system, and dynamic content correction system. This ensure academic strictness and pedagogical propriety of EZYer inputs and outputs. In order to evaluate EZYer, this paper designs five-dimensional evaluation indexes of content accuracy, knowledge coverage, usability, formatting correctness and visual design and appeal, and scores 100 Beamer and Notes generated by EZYer by five large language models, separately, and the results show that the quality of EZYer-generated content is excellent and has a good application prospect....

### 6. Emergent Chiral Spin Crystal Phase in (111) SrRuO3 Thin Films

**Summary:** Perovskite ruthenates are fascinating playgrounds for exploring topological spin textures, but generally rely on extrinsic mechanisms to trigger the noncoplanar states. Here we report the discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase in (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a significant topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements with different propagation vectors along two orthogonal directions. Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films. These findings open a new pathway for creating and controlling the topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design....

**ID:** 2511.22307v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22307v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22307v2)

**Summary:** Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies....

### 8. Opening the Black Box: An Explainable, Few-shot AI4E Framework Informed by Physics and Expert Knowledge for Materials Engineering

**Authors:** Haoxiang Zhang, Ruihao Yuan, Lihui Zhang, Yushi Luo, Qiang Zhang, Pan Ding, Xiaodong Ren, Weijie Xing, Niu Gao, Jishan Chen, Chubo Zhang

**Summary:** The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available....
