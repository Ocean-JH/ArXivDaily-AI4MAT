**Summary:** Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical,
chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal
conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength.
Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is
often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the
consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a
significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly
tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this
by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and
discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a
permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and
an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates
WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class
symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive
bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material
properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and
exhibits unparalleled inference speed....
