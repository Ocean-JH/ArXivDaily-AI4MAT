### 1. Efficient Generative Transformer Operators For Million-Point PDEs

**Authors:** Armand Kassaï Koupaï, Lise Le Boudec, Patrick Gallinari

**Published:** 2025-12-04

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2512.04974v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04974v1)

**Summary:** We introduce ECHO, a transformer-operator framework for generating million-point PDE trajectories. While existing neural operators (NOs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations, they remain limited in practice due to poor scalability on dense grids, error accumulation during dynamic unrolling, and task-specific design. ECHO addresses these challenges through three key innovations. (i) It employs a hierarchical convolutional encode-decode architecture that achieves a 100 $\times$ spatio-temporal compression while preserving fidelity on mesh points. (ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids. (iii) It adopts a generative modeling paradigm that learns complete trajectory segments, mitigating long-horizon error drift. The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation. The generative model further supports both conditional and unconditional generation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on million-point simulations across diverse PDE systems featuring complex geometries, high-frequency dynamics, and long-term horizons....

**Summary:** An Ag-doped CuO-AgCl-g-C3N4 heterostructure has been designed to achieve rapid Methylene Blue (MB) degradation through a synergistic photo-Fenton mechanism driven by low-power UV illumination. The composite integrates narrow-bandgap CuO, plasmonic Ag/AgCl, and visible-responsive g-C3N4 into a dual Z-scheme configuration that promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer while preserving strong redox potentials. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra ascertained the bandgap positions of the composite corresponding to those of its constituents: 2.9 eV (g-C3N4) and 1.42 eV (Ag-doped CuO-AgCl), indicating enhanced absorption and efficient charge carrier generation. BET analysis confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and revealed an effective surface area, ensuring the availability of abundant adsorption and reaction sites. A commercial 11 W UV irradiation was used for the photocatalytic test. Almost complete degradation of MB occurred within 10 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a high apparent rate constant of 0.45/min. The remarkable activity arises from the synergistic interplay of Fenton-like redox cycling and efficient photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that intentionally incorporated AgCl plays an active role as a plasmonic-semiconducting interface, strengthening charge separation and catalyst stability under neutral conditions, rather than acting as a passive chloride byproduct. Overall, by linking defect engineering, heterojunction design, and photo-Fenton synergy, this study establishes a low-power, catalytic platform offering a viable pathway towards sustainable dye wastewater remediation....

### 3. Bulk photovoltaic effect in MoSe$_2$ and Janus MoSSe sliding ferroelectrics

**Authors:** Roumita Roy, Giuseppe Cuono, Silvia Picozzi

**Published:** 2025-12-04

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2512.04760v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04760v1)

**Summary:** We present a first-principles study of the nonlinear optical properties of sliding ferroelectric bilayers based on MoSe$_2$ and Janus MoSSe. Two Janus configurations are considered: i) one bilayer where the two intralayer polarizations caused by Janus chemical asymmetry cancel each other out, yielding photocurrent spectra comparable to pristine MoSe$_2$ bilayers; ii) another bilayer where the intralayer polarizations add up, for which the photoresponses are strongly enhanced. Our results show that photocurrent generation in the polar Janus structures is predominantly governed by vertical chemical asymmetry, with limited dependence on the sliding direction. These findings highlight complementary design strategies: interlayer sliding enables sensitivity to external tuning, while the Janus intralayer polarization enhances photoresponses in the visible range. The interplay between composition and stacking therefore provides a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions in 2D ferroelectric materials....

### 4. Accelerating discovery of infrared nonlinear optical materials with large shift current via high-throughput screening

**Authors:** Aiqin Yang, Dian Jin, Mingkang Liu, Daye Zheng, Qi Wang, Qiangqiang Gu, Jian-Hua Jiang

**Published:** 2025-12-04

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2512.04717v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04717v1)

**Summary:** Discovering nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with strong shift current response, particularly in the infrared (IR) regime, is essential for next-generation optoelectronics yet remains highly challenging in both experiments and theory, which still largely relies on case by case studies. Here, we employ a high-throughput screening strategy, applying a multi-step filter to the Materials Project database (>154,000 materials), which yielded 2,519 candidate materials for detailed first-principle evaluation. From these calculations, we identify 32 NLO materials with strong shift current response ($σ$ > 100 $μA/V^2$). Our work reveals that layered structures with $C_{3v}$ symmetry and heavy $p$-block elements (e.g. Te, Sb) exhibit apparent superiority in enhancing shift current. More importantly, 9 of these compounds show shift current response peaks in the IR region, with the strongest reaching 616 $μA/V^2$, holding significant application potential in fields such as IR photodetection, sensing, and energy harvesting. Beyond identifying promising candidates, this work establishes a comprehensive and high-quality first-principles dataset for NLO response, providing a solid foundation for future AI-driven screening and accelerated discovery of high-performance NLO materials, as demonstrated by a prototype machine-learning application....

### 5. LeMat-GenBench: A Unified Evaluation Framework for Crystal Generative Models

**Authors:** Siddharth Betala, Samuel P. Gleason, Ali Ramlaoui, Andy Xu, Georgia Channing, Daniel Levy, Clémentine Fourrier, Nikita Kazeev, Chaitanya K. Joshi, Sékou-Oumar Kaba, Félix Therrien, Alex Hernandez-Garcia, Rocío Mercado, N. M. Anoop Krishnan, Alexandre Duval

**Published:** 2025-12-04

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04562v1)

**Summary:** Generative machine learning (ML) models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery through the inverse design of inorganic crystals, enabling an unprecedented exploration of chemical space. Yet, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks makes it challenging to evaluate, compare, and further develop these ML models meaningfully. In this work, we introduce LeMat-GenBench, a unified benchmark for generative models of crystalline materials, supported by a set of evaluation metrics designed to better inform model development and downstream applications. We release both an open-source evaluation suite and a public leaderboard on Hugging Face, and benchmark 12 recent generative models. Results reveal that an increase in stability leads to a decrease in novelty and diversity on average, with no model excelling across all dimensions. Altogether, LeMat-GenBench establishes a reproducible and extensible foundation for fair model comparison and aims to guide the development of more reliable, discovery-oriented generative models for crystalline materials....

### 6. General spin models from noncollinear spin density functional theory and spin-cluster expansion

**Authors:** Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda

**Published:** 2025-12-04

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2512.04458v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04458v1)

**Summary:** We present a data-efficient framework for constructing general classical spin Hamiltonians from the spin-cluster expansion (SCE) combined with fully self-consistent noncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). The key idea is to fit an SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each configuration supplies many independent constraints, which makes the regression well conditioned and sharply reduces the number of DFT calculations needed, especially in large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\rm Fe}_{x}{\rm Ge}$ and ${\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\rm Co}_{y}{\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design. An open-source implementation is available as the Julia package, \textit{Magesty.jl}....

### 7. Dara: Automated multiple-hypothesis phase identification and refinement from powder X-ray diffraction

**Authors:** Yuxing Fei, Matthew J. McDermott, Christopher L. Rom, Shilong Wang, Gerbrand Ceder

**Published:** 2025-10-22

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2510.19667v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19667v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19667v2)

**Summary:** Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns, particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information, multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering, automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion, peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully self-driving materials discovery....

### 8. Quantifying Phase Transformations in Alloying Anodes via In-Situ Liquid Cell Hard X-ray Spectroscopy and Cryogenic Microscopy

**Authors:** Neil Mulcahy, Syeda Ramin Jannat, Yaqi Li, Tigran Simonian, Mariana Palos, James O. Douglas, Jessica M. Walker, Baptiste Gault, Mary P. Ryan, Michele Shelly Conroy

**Published:** 2025-11-20

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2511.16382v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16382v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16382v2)

**Summary:** Understanding electrochemical phenomena at complex liquid solid interfaces requires linking real time structural dynamics with atomic scale interfacial chemistry. Here, we integrate operando synchrotron X-ray fluorescence and diffraction with high resolution cryogenic electron and ion multi model microscopy to provide a mechanistic understanding of Pt based alloying anodes across length scales. We directly observe the initial lithiation driven formation of Li2Pt and its evolution to a stable LiPt intermetallic phase during extended cycling via a solid solution type reaction mechanism. Simultaneously, the solid electrolyte interphase transitions from an unstable carbonate rich to a stable LiF dominated composition, confirmed by cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography reveals spatially distinct compositional regimes within the alloy anode, including lithium flux limited, heterogeneous interfacial zone and a diffusion controlled, homogeneous LiPt alloy bulk. This nanoscale compositional gradient rationalises the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism and highlights how kinetic limitations and interface dynamics govern alloy formation and electrochemical stability. Our findings demonstrate a broadly applicable correlative framework bridging operando structural dynamics with near atomic resolution interfacial chemistry, advancing the rational design of durable alloy electrodes for next generation energy storage....
