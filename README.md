### 1. Artificial Intelligence and Generative Models for Materials Discovery -- A Review

**Authors:** Albertus Denny Handoko, Riko I Made

**Published:** 2025-08-05

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2508.03278v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03278v1)

**Summary:** High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and
open material databases are radically changing the way new materials are
discovered. From the experimentally driven approach in the past, we are moving
quickly towards the artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach, realizing the
'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given
the desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of
AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery,
including different materials representations available for this purpose. We
will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new
catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges
such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability,
and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate
AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models,
physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review
aims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative
potential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare,
and energy innovation....

### 2. Autonomous Inorganic Materials Discovery via Multi-Agent Physics-Aware Scientific Reasoning

**Authors:** Alireza Ghafarollahi, Markus J. Buehler

**Published:** 2025-08-04

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2508.02956v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02956v1)

**Summary:** Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials
design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet
they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into
their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system
capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle,
from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We
introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic
materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and
executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results,
and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives.
SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research
gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps,
including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization,
embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is
evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and
perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of
SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the
user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter
consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific
rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world
design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate
SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically
meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing
materials knowledge....

### 3. CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks

**Authors:** Krit Tangsongcharoen, Teerachote Pakornchote, Chayanon Atthapak, Natthaphon Choomphon-anomakhun, Annop Ektarawong, Björn Alling, Christopher Sutton, Thiti Bovornratanaraks, Thiparat Chotibut

**Published:** 2025-01-15

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2501.08998v3

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998v3)

**Summary:** Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically
stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central
challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a
diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel
crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density
functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates,
atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian
manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion
process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an
equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and
translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates
the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their
ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling
conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group.
These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by
offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental
validation....
