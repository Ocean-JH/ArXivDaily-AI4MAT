### 1. MetaGen: A DSL, Database, and Benchmark for VLM-Assisted Metamaterial Generation

**Authors:** Liane Makatura, Benjamin Jones, Siyuan Bian, Wojciech Matusik

**Published:** 2025-08-25

**Category:** cs.CV

**ID:** 2508.17568v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17568v1)

**Summary:** Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships....

### 2. Toward Knowledge-Guided AI for Inverse Design in Manufacturing: A Perspective on Domain, Physics, and Human-AI Synergy

**Authors:** Hugon Lee, Hyeonbin Moon, Junhyeong Lee, Seunghwa RYu

**Published:** 2025-05-29

**Category:** cs.AI

**ID:** 2506.00056v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00056v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00056v2)

**Summary:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design in manufacturing,
enabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and processes.
However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic
manufacturing settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design
spaces, and complex constraints. This perspective proposes an integrated
framework built on three complementary pillars: domain knowledge to establish
physically meaningful objectives and constraints while removing variables with
limited relevance, physics-informed machine learning to enhance generalization
under limited or biased data, and large language model-based interfaces to
support intuitive, human-centered interaction. Using injection molding as an
illustrative example, we demonstrate how these components can operate in
practice and conclude by highlighting key challenges for applying such
approaches in realistic manufacturing environments....

### 3. CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation

**Authors:** Xiaohan Yi, Guikun Xu, Xi Xiao, Zhong Zhang, Liu Liu, Yatao Bian, Peilin Zhao

**Published:** 2025-08-13

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2508.16614v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614v1)

**Summary:** We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting....
