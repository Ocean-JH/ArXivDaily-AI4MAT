### 1. Generative AI for Crystal Structures: A Review

**Authors:** Pierre-Paul De Breuck, Hai-Chen Wang, Gian-Marco Rignanese, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marques

**Published:** 2025-09-02

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2509.02723v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02723v1)

**Summary:** As in many other fields, the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence
is reshaping materials discovery by offering new ways to propose crystal
structures and, in some cases, even predict desired properties. This review
provides a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in generative models
specifically for inorganic crystalline materials. We begin by introducing the
fundamentals of generative modeling and invertible material descriptors. We
then propose a taxonomy based on architecture, representation, conditioning,
and materials domain to categorize the diverse range of current generative AI
models. We discuss data sources and address challenges related to performance
metrics, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarks. Specific examples
and applications of novel generated structures are presented. Finally, we
examine current limitations and future directions in this rapidly evolving
field, highlighting its potential to accelerate the discovery of new inorganic
materials....

### 2. Crystal Structure Prediction with a Geometric Permutation-Invariant Loss Function

**Authors:** Emmanuel Jehanno, Romain Menegaux, Julien Mairal, Sergei Grudinin

**Published:** 2025-08-31

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2509.00832v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00832v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00832v1)

**Summary:** Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD)....
