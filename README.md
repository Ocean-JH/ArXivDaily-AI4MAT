### 1. DiffractGPT: Atomic Structure Determination from X-ray Diffraction Patterns using Generative Pre-trained Transformer

**Authors:** Kamal Choudhary

**Published:** 2025-08-11

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**Summary:** Crystal structure determination from powder diffraction patterns is a complex
challenge in materials science, often requiring extensive expertise and
computational resources. This study introduces DiffractGPT, a generative
pre-trained transformer model designed to predict atomic structures directly
from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. By capturing the intricate relationships
between diffraction patterns and crystal structures, DiffractGPT enables fast
and accurate inverse design. Trained on thousands of atomic structures and
their simulated XRD patterns from the JARVIS-DFT dataset, we evaluate the model
across three scenarios: (1) without chemical information, (2) with a list of
elements, and (3) with an explicit chemical formula. The results demonstrate
that incorporating chemical information significantly enhances prediction
accuracy. Additionally, the training process is straightforward and fast,
bridging gaps between computational, data science, and experimental
communities. This work represents a significant advancement in automating
crystal structure determination, offering a robust tool for data-driven
materials discovery and design....
