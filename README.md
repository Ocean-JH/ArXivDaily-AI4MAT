### 1. EAC-Net: Predicting real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions

**Authors:** Xuejian Qin Taoyuze Lv, Zhicheng Zhong

**Published:** 2025-08-06

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2508.04052v2

**Summary:** Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully
defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with
high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models
are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.
Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which
couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and
basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1%
error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems.
Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model
covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot
performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training
distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure
calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities,
EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure
prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery....
