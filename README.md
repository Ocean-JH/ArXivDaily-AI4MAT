**Summary:** The rational combination of existing magnetic topological compounds presents
a promising route for designing new topological materials. We report the
synthesis and comprehensive characterization of the layered quaternary
intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$, which combines structural units of
two known magnetic topological materials, EuCuAs and EuZn$_2$As$_2$.
Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with successive
magnetic transitions: quasi-two-dimensional ordering at $T_\mathrm{M} =
29.3$\,K, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 19$\,K, and
spin-reorientation at $T_\mathrm{SR} = 16.3$\,K. The stepwise magnetic
transitions manifest as plateau-like anomalies in the heat capacity. These
transitions originate from multiple superexchange pathways and periodic
variation of interplane Eu-Eu distances in the intergrowth structure. Charge
transport shows a pronounced resistivity increase above $T_\mathrm{N}$ followed
by minimal change below the ordering temperature. Magnetic fields rapidly
suppress this resistivity rise, yielding significant negative
magnetoresistance. Remarkably, Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ inherits the nonlinear
anomalous Hall effect characteristic of its parent compounds. Energy
evaluations of collinear spin configurations reveal a lowest-energy state with
ferromagnetic coupling between Eu planes in EuCuAs units while maintaining
antiferromagnetic coupling within EuZn$_2$As$_2$ units. The corresponding
electronic structure displays potentially topologically nontrivial features.
Our work demonstrates the efficacy of structural hybridization for discovering
novel magnetic topological materials and establishes a general strategy for
materials discovery....

**Summary:** One of the current trends of laser applications in material science is using
high-intensity lasers to provide fast and efficient surface or volume
modifications for achieving controllable material properties, synthesis of
novel materials with desired functionalities, and upscaling laser technologies
with industry-demanded throughputs. Depending on the parameters, lasers can
offer versatile solutions for scientific and industrial applications, starting
from exploring the fundamental physics of warm dense matter and molecular
chemistry at ultrashort timescales to large-scale fabrication of surfaces with
anti-bacterial, tribological, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic properties. The
objectives of this Chapter are to provide a review of recent advancements in
several laser application fields, which involve high-intensity lasers, both
ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) and short (nanosecond). After summarizing
general trends in high-intensity laser processing of materials, we will first
focus on the new opportunities offered by high-intensity lasers for the
controlled synthesis of multielement nanoparticles for catalytic and
theranostic applications. Then, the blister-based laser-induced forward
transfer (BB-LIFT) technique will be presented, allowing a one-step,
high-precision printing of nanomaterials on any substrates. The next section
will discuss the selective crystallization of amorphous (as prepared)
semiconductor nanoscale materials. The processes enabling high selectivity of
crystallization into the desired phase using ultrashort powerful lasers will be
analyzed. After that, opportunities for using high-power lasers will be
discussed for upscaling surface nanostructuring with high throughput for
bio-medical and industrial applications. Finally, an introduction to the Open
Access program of the HiLASE Centre, which is targeted at offering users
high-intensity beam time, will be given....
