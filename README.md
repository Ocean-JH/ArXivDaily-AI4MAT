### 1. Extended Factorization Machine Annealing for Rapid Discovery of Transparent Conducting Materials

**Authors:** Daisuke Makino, Tatsuya Goto, Yoshinori Suga

**Published:** 2025-07-30

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2507.23160v1

**Summary:** The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential
for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices
such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which
combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method
to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that
reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the
further advancement of materials informatics....
