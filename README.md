### 1. Self-Optimizing Machine Learning Potential Assisted Automated Workflow for Highly Efficient Complex Systems Material Design

**Authors:** Jiaxiang Li, Junwei Feng, Jie Luo, Bowen Jiang, Xiangyu Zheng, Qigang Song, Jian Lv, Keith Butler, Hanyu Liu, Congwei Xie, Yu Xie, Yanming Ma

**Published:** 2025-05-13

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2505.08159v2

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08159v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08159v2)

**Summary:** Machine learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized complex materials
design by enabling rapid exploration of material configurational spaces via
crystal structure prediction with ab initio accuracy. However, critical
challenges persist in ensuring robust generalization to unknown structures and
minimizing the requirement for substantial expert knowledge and time-consuming
manual interventions. Here, we propose an automated crystal structure
prediction framework built upon the attention-coupled neural networks potential
to address these limitations. The generalizability of the potential is achieved
by sampling regions across the local minima of the potential energy surface,
where the self-evolving pipeline autonomously refines the potential iteratively
while minimizing human intervention. The workflow is validated on Mg-Ca-H
ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary systems by exploring nearly 10 million
configurations, demonstrating substantial speedup compared to first-principles
calculations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in
accelerating the exploration and discovery of complex multi-component
functional materials....

### 2. Can Multimodal LLMs See Materials Clearly? A Multimodal Benchmark on Materials Characterization

**Authors:** Zhengzhao Lai, Youbin Zheng, Zhenyang Cai, Haonan Lyu, Jinpu Yang, Hongqing Liang, Yan Hu, Benyou Wang

**Published:** 2025-09-11

**Category:** cs.CV

**ID:** 2509.09307v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09307v1)

**Summary:** Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at
