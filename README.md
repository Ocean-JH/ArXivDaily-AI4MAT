### 1. InvDesFlow-AL: Active Learning-based Workflow for Inverse Design of Functional Materials

**Authors:** Xiao-Qi Han, Peng-Jie Guo, Ze-Feng Gao, Hao Sun, Zhong-Yi Lu

**Published:** 2025-05-14

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2505.09203v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09203v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09203v1)

**Summary:** Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific
properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis,
energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion
principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance
constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process.
However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures
often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel
inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is
based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize
the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired
performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the
InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96%
improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models.
Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of
low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate
materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously
expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative
model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove
the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors
under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we
successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor
with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides
strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials
science....

### 2. Bridging Theory and Experiment in Materials Discovery: Machine-Learning-Assisted Prediction of Synthesizable Structures

**Authors:** Yu Xin, Peng Liu, Zhuohang Xie, Wenhui Mi, Pengyue Gao, Hong Jian Zhao, Jian Lv, Yanchao Wang, Yanming Ma

**Published:** 2025-05-14

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2505.09161v1

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09161v1)

**Summary:** Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has
revolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often
struggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized
through kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between
theoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a
synthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure
derivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the
efficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable
structures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based
synthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized
structures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab
initio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The
framework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn,
Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting
synthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the
554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising
synthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X =
Ti, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$
candidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for
experimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally
observed temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a
data-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials
synthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational
predictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for
the targeted discovery of novel functional materials....
