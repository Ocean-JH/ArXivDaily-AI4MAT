**Summary:** Developing efficient and universal polymer crosslinking strategies is pivotal
for advanced material design, especially for challenging matrixes like
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Traditional crosslinkers such as
divinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are
limited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast,
bis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing
thermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly
selective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory
(DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We
demonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy
barriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts
and with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length. Moreover, BD exhibits
selective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS,
respectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB,
especially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of
magnitude faster. Our findings provide atomistic insights into BD crosslinker
reactivity and establish a mechanistic foundation for next-generation,
universal C-H activation-based crosslinking technologies....
