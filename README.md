### 1. HiLAB: A Hybrid Inverse-Design Framework

**Authors:** Reza Marzban, Hamed Abiri, Raphael Pestourie, Ali Adibi

**Summary:** HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based
partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse
design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological
optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE)
and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by
generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs.
Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters,
produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a
compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize
geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused
for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition
function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB
systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer
electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the
total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude,
accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its
efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green,
and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while
mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing
demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust,
multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation
nanophotonic challenges....
