### 1. DiffCrysGen: A Score-Based Diffusion Model for Design of Diverse Inorganic Crystalline Materials

**Summary:** Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials
discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials
with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for
crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to
separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These
methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising,
which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we
introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that
jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline
materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices,
DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules,
enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and
lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic
symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it
to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied
DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high
saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable,
diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications....
