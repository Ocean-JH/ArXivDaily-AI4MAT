    "summary": "The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new\nenergy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances\nin data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal\nstructures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling\nwithout strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to\nidentify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties.\nIn this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes\nmultiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures\nwith specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate\nconstraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated\nby a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which\nconsiders the target properties. These constraints are then used by a\nsubsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation\nprocess is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a\nprobability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of\nexisting approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals\nstrictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of\nsupply chain during production.",
