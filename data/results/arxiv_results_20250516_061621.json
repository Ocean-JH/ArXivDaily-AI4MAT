    "summary": "Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific\nproperties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis,\nenergy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion\nprinciples can directly produce new materials that meet performance\nconstraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process.\nHowever, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures\noften remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel\ninverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is\nbased on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize\nthe material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired\nperformance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the\nInvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\\AA}, representing an 32.96%\nimprovement in performance compared to exsisting generative models.\nAdditionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of\nlow-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate\nmaterials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously\nexpanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative\nmodel in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove\nthe effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors\nunder ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we\nsuccessfully identified Li\\(_2\\)AuH\\(_6\\) as a conventional BCS superconductor\nwith an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides\nstrong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials\nscience.",

    "summary": "Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has\nrevolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often\nstruggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized\nthrough kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between\ntheoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a\nsynthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure\nderivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the\nefficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable\nstructures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based\nsynthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized\nstructures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab\ninitio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The\nframework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn,\nFe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting\nsynthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the\n554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising\nsynthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X =\nTi, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$\ncandidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for\nexperimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally\nobserved temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a\ndata-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials\nsynthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational\npredictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for\nthe targeted discovery of novel functional materials.",
