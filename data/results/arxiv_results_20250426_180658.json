    "summary": "Solving black-box optimization problems with Ising machines is increasingly\ncommon in materials science. However, their application to crystal structure\nprediction (CSP) is still ineffective due to symmetry agnostic encoding of\natomic coordinates. We introduce CRYSIM, an algorithm that encodes the space\ngroup, the Wyckoff positions combination, and coordinates of independent atomic\nsites as separate variables. This encoding reduces the search space\nsubstantially by exploiting the symmetry in space groups. When CRYSIM is\ninterfaced to Fixstars Amplify, a GPU-based Ising machine, its prediction\nperformance was competitive with CALYPSO and Bayesian optimization for crystals\ncontaining more than 150 atoms in a unit cell. Although it is not realistic to\ninterface CRYSIM to current small-scale quantum devices, it has the potential\nto become the standard CSP algorithm in the coming quantum age.",

    "summary": "Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal\nstructures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering\nnovel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as\nproteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored\narea due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this\npaper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address\nCSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary\nfoundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy\nprediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that\nour DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all\nmetrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in\ngenerating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and\nenergy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's\nperformance. When applied to three real-world superconductors\n($\\text{CsV}_3\\text{Sb}_5$, $ \\text{Zr}_{16}\\text{Rh}_8\\text{O}_4$ and\n$\\text{Zr}_{16}\\text{Pd}_8\\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to\nanalyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature\npredictions and structure generations. For instance, on\n$\\text{CsV}_3\\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the\nexperimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with\nhigh accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast,\nconventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the\nstructure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE\nis nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times\nslower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our\napproach for advancing materials science research and development.",

    "summary": "Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g.,\nmaterials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches\nprimarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models,\neach offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations.\nAutoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated\nremarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to\nmultimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like\nVQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their\ndirect application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high\nprecision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other\nhand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data,\nsuch as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy.\nYet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as\ngeneral-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we\npropose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token\nprediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the\nstrengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional\ndiffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision\nof autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on\nmaterial and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in\nstate-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and\nestablishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure\nprediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX\ndemonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences\nfor complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for\nscientific data generation.",

Almost all known crystalline\nmaterials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal\nstructures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules\nare not accounted for.

A\nstraightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures\nthrough structure-aligned coordinate systems, or\"frames.\" However, unlike\nmolecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to\ntheir infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods\nrely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its\nstructural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we\nrethink the role of frames, questioning whether such simplistic alignment with\nthe structure is sufficient, and propose the concept of dynamic frames. While\naccommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames\nprovide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on\nactively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the\nattention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in\na new architecture called CrystalFramer. Extensive experiments show that\nCrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in\nvarious crystal property prediction tasks.",

The results show that MatterSim outperforms others in\nnearly all metrics, particularly in complex material systems, demonstrating\nsuperior accuracy and physical consistency. Other models exhibit significant\ndeviations due to issues like energy inconsistency or insufficient training\ndata coverage.Further analysis reveals that MatterSim achieves excellent\nagreement with reference values in lithium-ion diffusivity calculations,\nespecially at room temperature. Studies on Li3YCl6 and Li6PS5Cl uncover how\ncrystal structure, anion disorder levels, and Na/Li arrangements influence\nionic conductivity.

    "summary": "Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most\ngenerative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom\nwithout any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative\nmodel, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based\ndescriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure\nrepresentation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network\narchitecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete\ngenerative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction,\nthe discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally\npresent a new metric, Fr\\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the\nsymmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff\nagainst recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.",

A masked node prediction pretraining strategy\nfurther enhances atomic-level information integration. Our method achieved up\nto 22.9\\% improvement in property prediction across four crystal properties\nincluding band gap compared to methods like CrysMMNet and MultiMat.

Unlike molecules, crystal structures\nexhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of\ncapturing both local and global information effectively.

Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must\neffectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite\ndesign space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMG), a unifying\nframework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline\nmaterials. OMG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base\ndistribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class\nof tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow\nmatching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by\nintegrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and\nextending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell\nrepresentations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates\nand lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We\nbenchmark OMG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)\nfor specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering\nstable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMG,\nwe refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMG\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art in generative modeling for materials\ndiscovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.\nThese results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning\nframeworks to accelerate progress in materials science.",

From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy\nstability criteria (Ehull < 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six\ncandidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band\nstructure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which\nexhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a\nsymmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure\nprediction model.

    "summary": "Machine learning has become a crucial tool for predicting the properties of\ncrystalline materials. However, existing methods primarily represent material\ninformation by constructing multi-edge graphs of crystal structures, often\noverlooking the chemical and physical properties of elements (such as atomic\nradius, electronegativity, melting point, and ionization energy), which have a\nsignificant impact on material performance. To address this limitation, we\nfirst constructed an element property knowledge graph and utilized an embedding\nmodel to encode the element attributes within the knowledge graph. Furthermore,\nwe propose a multimodal fusion framework, ESNet, which integrates element\nproperty features with crystal structure features to generate joint multimodal\nrepresentations. This provides a more comprehensive perspective for predicting\nthe performance of crystalline materials, enabling the model to consider both\nmicrostructural composition and chemical characteristics of the materials. We\nconducted experiments on the Materials Project benchmark dataset, which showed\nleading performance in the bandgap prediction task and achieved results on a\npar with existing benchmarks in the formation energy prediction task.",

    "summary": "Discovering new solid-state materials requires rapidly exploring the vast\nspace of crystal structures and locating stable regions. Generating stable\nmaterials with desired properties and compositions is extremely difficult as we\nsearch for very small isolated pockets in the exponentially many possibilities,\nconsidering elements from the periodic table and their 3D arrangements in\ncrystal lattices. Materials discovery necessitates both optimized solution\nstructures and diversity in the generated material structures. Existing methods\nstruggle to explore large material spaces and generate diverse samples with\ndesired properties and requirements. We propose the Symmetry-aware Hierarchical\nArchitecture for Flow-based Traversal (SHAFT), a novel generative model\nemploying a hierarchical exploration strategy to efficiently exploit the\nsymmetry of the materials space to generate crystal structures given desired\nproperties. In particular, our model decomposes the exponentially large\nmaterials space into a hierarchy of subspaces consisting of symmetric space\ngroups, lattice parameters, and atoms. We demonstrate that SHAFT significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art iterative generative methods, such as Generative\nFlow Networks (GFlowNets) and Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoders\n(CDVAE), in crystal structure generation tasks, achieving higher validity,\ndiversity, and stability of generated structures optimized for target\nproperties and requirements.",

AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping\nto accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and\nstructures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven\napproaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the\nprocess of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches\nto the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse\nproblem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without\nutilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1)\nconditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an\narbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most\nenergetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2)\nconditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that\nincludes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types,\nchemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss\nfunction was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of\ncrystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching,\nusual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches.\nAs a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare\ntarget structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our\nmodifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy\n41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency,\ninference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new\nstructures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.",

Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously\noptimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even\nwith models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap\noptimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining\nelectrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites,\nwhere the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging.

    "summary": "Generative models trained at scale can now produce text, video, and more\nrecently, scientific data such as crystal structures. In applications of\ngenerative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal\nstructures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level\ninstructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate\ncrystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate\nend-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for\ncontrollable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language\nmodel that takes high-level natural language as input and generates\nintermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and\n(2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and\ngenerates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally\nuses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from\nthe generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three\ncomponents to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible\nstructures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of\ndirectly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user\nrequest and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able\nto generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels,\nsolely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more\ncomplex structure generation in near future.",

While LLMs have shown remarkable success in various domains, their\napplication to materials science remains underexplored. A fundamental challenge\nis the lack of understanding of how to best utilize text-based representations\nfor materials modeling. This challenge is further compounded by the absence of\na comprehensive benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities and\nlimitations of these text representations in capturing the complexity of\nmaterial systems. To address this gap, we propose MatText, a suite of\nbenchmarking tools and datasets designed to systematically evaluate the\nperformance of language models in modeling materials. MatText encompasses nine\ndistinct text-based representations for material systems, including several\nnovel representations. Each representation incorporates unique inductive biases\nthat capture relevant information and integrate prior physical knowledge about\nmaterials. Additionally, MatText provides essential tools for training and\nbenchmarking the performance of language models in the context of materials\nscience. These tools include standardized dataset splits for each\nrepresentation, probes for evaluating sensitivity to geometric factors, and\ntools for seamlessly converting crystal structures into text. Using MatText, we\nconduct an extensive analysis of the capabilities of language models in\nmodeling materials. Our findings reveal that current language models\nconsistently struggle to capture the geometric information crucial for\nmaterials modeling across all representations.

    "summary": "Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$)\nprovides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing\ntransition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating\nself-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are\nparticularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic\nstates. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate\ndetermination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In\npractice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior\nknowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive\nfirst-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based\non equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as\ndescriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical\nenvironment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the\nprediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative\nlinear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation\ntheory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data\nfrom 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our\nmodel achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and\n$V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or\nDFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the\nprediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while\napproaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust\ntransferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and\ndesign via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various\ntechnological applications.",

    "summary": "Computational prediction of stable crystal structures has a profound impact\non the large-scale discovery of novel functional materials. However, predicting\nthe crystal structure solely from a material's composition or formula is a\npromising yet challenging task, as traditional ab initio crystal structure\nprediction (CSP) methods rely on time-consuming global searches and\nfirst-principles free energy calculations. Inspired by the recent success of\ndeep learning approaches in protein structure prediction, which utilize\npairwise amino acid interactions to describe 3D structures, we present\nAlphaCrystal-II, a novel knowledge-based solution that exploits the abundant\ninter-atomic interaction patterns found in existing known crystal structures.\nAlphaCrystal-II predicts the atomic distance matrix of a target crystal\nmaterial and employs this matrix to reconstruct its 3D crystal structure. By\nleveraging the wealth of inter-atomic relationships of known crystal\nstructures, our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and reliability\nin structure prediction through comprehensive experiments. This work highlights\nthe potential of data-driven methods in accelerating the discovery and design\nof new materials with tailored properties.",

The incorporation of space group symmetry significantly simplifies\nthe crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative\nmodeling of crystalline materials.

We demonstrate the advantages of\nCrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and\nelement substitution compared to conventional methods implemented in popular\ncrystal structure prediction software. Moreover, we showcase the application of\nCrystalFormer of property-guided materials design in a plug-and-play manner.\nOur analysis shows that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry\nknowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling\nsystematic exploration of crystalline materials.

In peripheral areas such as the\nprediction of molecular properties, fully connected attention networks have\nbeen shown to be successful. However, unlike these finite atom arrangements,\ncrystal structures are infinitely repeating, periodic arrangements of atoms,\nwhose fully connected attention results in infinitely connected attention. In\nthis work, we show that this infinitely connected attention can lead to a\ncomputationally tractable formulation, interpreted as neural potential\nsummation, that performs infinite interatomic potential summations in a deeply\nlearned feature space.

Addressing these hurdles, this study\nintroduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian\nmatrices obtained from first-principles DFT calculations of nearly all crystal\nstructures on the Materials Project. We demonstrate its generality in\npredicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including\ncomplex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\\'e twisted\nbilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we\nutilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of\nelectronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940\ncrystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering\na reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this\nuniversal Hamiltonian model lays the groundwork for advancements in diverse\nfields, such as easily providing a huge data set of electronic structures and\nalso making the materials design across the whole periodic table possible.",

Using\nenergy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and\ngold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned\nLLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice\nthe rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text\nprompting's inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for\nunconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures\nand text-conditional generation.

While various learning-based approaches have been proposed for\ncrystal generation, existing methods seldom consider the space group constraint\nwhich is crucial in describing the geometry of crystals and closely relevant to\nmany desirable properties. However, considering space group constraint is\nchallenging owing to its diverse and nontrivial forms. In this paper, we reduce\nthe space group constraint into an equivalent formulation that is more\ntractable to be handcrafted into the generation process. In particular, we\ntranslate the space group constraint into two parts: the basis constraint of\nthe invariant logarithmic space of the lattice matrix and the Wyckoff position\nconstraint of the fractional coordinates. Upon the derived constraints, we then\npropose DiffCSP++, a novel diffusion model that has enhanced a previous work\nDiffCSP by further taking space group constraint into account. Experiments on\nseveral popular datasets verify the benefit of the involvement of the space\ngroup constraint, and show that our DiffCSP++ achieves promising performance on\ncrystal structure prediction, ab initio crystal generation and controllable\ngeneration with customized space groups.",

    "summary": "Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use\nin the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However,\nLLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and\ninevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and\ndata. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can\ndynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data\non Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput\nworkflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage\nability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science\nconcepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data\n(such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in\ncomputational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining\nuncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of\nresponses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively\nmitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli,\nelectronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data\nsources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and\nrun annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning\nforce fields.

    "summary": "Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and\nexperimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and\nantiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many\nexotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic\nmaterials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types\nof altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a\ncomprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new\napplications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage\ndevices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a\nunique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered\nby an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn\nthe intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by\nfine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the\naltermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we\nsuccessfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals,\nsemiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic\nstructure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics\nreveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly\ndiscovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr\neffect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave\naltermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine\nperforms much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic\nmaterials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated\ndiscovery of the materials with targeted properties.",

While previous works mainly focus on obtaining high-quality\nrepresentations of crystalline materials for DOS prediction, we focus on\npredicting the DOS from the obtained representations by reflecting the nature\nof DOS: DOS determines the general distribution of states as a function of\nenergy. That is, DOS is not solely determined by the crystalline material but\nalso by the energy levels, which has been neglected in previous works. In this\npaper, we propose to integrate heterogeneous information obtained from the\ncrystalline materials and the energies via a multi-modal transformer, thereby\nmodeling the complex relationships between the atoms in the crystalline\nmaterials and various energy levels for DOS prediction. Moreover, we propose to\nutilize prompts to guide the model to learn the crystal structural\nsystem-specific interactions between crystalline materials and energies.\nExtensive experiments on two types of DOS, i.e., Phonon DOS and Electron DOS,\nwith various real-world scenarios demonstrate the superiority of\nDOSTransformer.

    "summary": "Equivariant graph neural networks force fields (EGraFFs) have shown great\npromise in modelling complex interactions in atomic systems by exploiting the\ngraphs' inherent symmetries. Recent works have led to a surge in the\ndevelopment of novel architectures that incorporate equivariance-based\ninductive biases alongside architectural innovations like graph transformers\nand message passing to model atomic interactions. However, thorough evaluations\nof these deploying EGraFFs for the downstream task of real-world atomistic\nsimulations, is lacking. To this end, here we perform a systematic benchmarking\nof 6 EGraFF algorithms (NequIP, Allegro, BOTNet, MACE, Equiformer, TorchMDNet),\nwith the aim of understanding their capabilities and limitations for realistic\natomistic simulations. In addition to our thorough evaluation and analysis on\neight existing datasets based on the benchmarking literature, we release two\nnew benchmark datasets, propose four new metrics, and three challenging tasks.\nThe new datasets and tasks evaluate the performance of EGraFF to\nout-of-distribution data, in terms of different crystal structures,\ntemperatures, and new molecules. Interestingly, evaluation of the EGraFF models\nbased on dynamic simulations reveals that having a lower error on energy or\nforce does not guarantee stable or reliable simulation or faithful replication\nof the atomic structures. Moreover, we find that no model clearly outperforms\nother models on all datasets and tasks. Importantly, we show that the\nperformance of all the models on out-of-distribution datasets is unreliable,\npointing to the need for the development of a foundation model for force fields\nthat can be used in real-world simulations. In summary, this work establishes a\nrigorous framework for evaluating machine learning force fields in the context\nof atomic simulations and points to open research challenges within this\ndomain.",

In response to this formidable\ntask, we introduce a deep learning-based generative model for material\ncomposition and structure design by learning and exploiting explicit and\nimplicit chemical knowledge. Our pipeline first uses deep diffusion language\nmodels as the generator of compositions and then applies a template-based\ncrystal structure prediction algorithm to predict their corresponding\nstructures, which is then followed by structure relaxation using a universal\ngraph neural network-based potential. The density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations of the formation energies and energy-above-the-hull analysis are\nused to validate new structures generated through our pipeline. Based on the\nDFT calculation results, six new materials, including Ti2HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,\nTaReO4, HfTiO2, and HfMnO2, with formation energy less than zero have been\nfound. Remarkably, among these, four materials, namely Ti2$HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,\nand TaReO4, exhibit an e-above-hull energy of less than 0.3 eV.

While CSP can be addressed by employing currently-prevailing\ngenerative models (e.g. diffusion models), this task encounters unique\nchallenges owing to the symmetric geometry of crystal structures -- the\ninvariance of translation, rotation, and periodicity. To incorporate the above\nsymmetries, this paper proposes DiffCSP, a novel diffusion model to learn the\nstructure distribution from stable crystals. To be specific, DiffCSP jointly\ngenerates the lattice and atom coordinates for each crystal by employing a\nperiodic-E(3)-equivariant denoising model, to better model the crystal\ngeometry. Notably, different from related equivariant generative approaches,\nDiffCSP leverages fractional coordinates other than Cartesian coordinates to\nrepresent crystals, remarkably promoting the diffusion and the generation\nprocess of atom positions. Extensive experiments verify that our DiffCSP\nsignificantly outperforms existing CSP methods, with a much lower computation\ncost in contrast to DFT-based methods. Moreover, the superiority of DiffCSP is\nalso observed when it is extended for ab initio crystal generation.",

However, the training is time-consuming for deep-learning\nmodels, and the regression process is a black box that is hard to interpret.\nAlso, the preprocess to transfer a crystal structure into the input of ML,\ncalled descriptor, needs to be designed carefully. To efficiently predict\nimportant properties of materials, we propose an approach based on ensemble\nlearning consisting of regression trees to predict formation energy and elastic\nconstants based on small-size datasets of carbon allotropes as an example.\nWithout using any descriptor, the inputs are the properties calculated by\nmolecular dynamics with 9 different classical interatomic potentials. Overall,\nthe results from ensemble learning are more accurate than those from classical\ninteratomic potentials, and ensemble learning can capture the relatively\naccurate properties from the 9 classical potentials as criteria for predicting\nthe final properties.",

    "summary": "Zeolites are inorganic materials known for their diversity of applications,\nsynthesis conditions, and resulting polymorphs. Although their synthesis is\ncontrolled both by inorganic and organic synthesis conditions, computational\nstudies of zeolite synthesis have focused mostly on organic template design. In\nthis work, we use a strong distance metric between crystal structures and\nmachine learning (ML) to create inorganic synthesis maps in zeolites. Starting\nwith 253 known zeolites, we show how the continuous distances between\nframeworks reproduce inorganic synthesis conditions from the literature without\nusing labels such as building units. An unsupervised learning analysis shows\nthat neighboring zeolites according to our metric often share similar inorganic\nsynthesis conditions, even in template-based routes. In combination with ML\nclassifiers, we find synthesis-structure relationships for 14 common inorganic\nconditions in zeolites, namely Al, B, Be, Ca, Co, F, Ga, Ge, K, Mg, Na, P, Si,\nand Zn. By explaining the model predictions, we demonstrate how\n(dis)similarities towards known structures can be used as features for the\nsynthesis space. Finally, we show how these methods can be used to predict\ninorganic synthesis conditions for unrealized frameworks in hypothetical\ndatabases and interpret the outcomes by extracting local structural patterns\nfrom zeolites. In combination with template design, this work can accelerate\nthe exploration of the space of synthesis conditions for zeolites.",

However, there are two technical challenges to be addressed for\nspeeding up the investigation of crystals. First, labeling crystal properties\nis intrinsically difficult due to the high cost and time involved in physical\nsimulations or lab experiments. Second, crystals adhere to a specific quantum\nchemical principle known as periodic invariance, which is often not captured by\nexisting machine learning methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose the\ncrystal-specific pre-training framework for learning crystal representations\nwith self-supervision. The framework designs a mutex mask strategy for\nenhancing representation learning so as to alleviate the limited labels\navailable for crystal property prediction. Moreover, we take into account the\nspecific periodic invariance in crystal structures by developing a periodic\ninvariance multi-graph module and periodic attribute learning within our\nframework. This framework has been tested on eight different tasks. The\nexperimental results on these tasks show that the framework achieves promising\nprediction performance and is able to outperform recent strong baselines.",

    "summary": "In recent years, graph neural network (GNN) based approaches have emerged as\na powerful technique to encode complex topological structure of crystal\nmaterials in an enriched representation space. These models are often\nsupervised in nature and using the property-specific training data, learn\nrelationship between crystal structure and different properties like formation\nenergy, bandgap, bulk modulus, etc. Most of these methods require a huge amount\nof property-tagged data to train the system which may not be available for\ndifferent properties. However, there is an availability of a huge amount of\ncrystal data with its chemical composition and structural bonds. To leverage\nthese untapped data, this paper presents CrysGNN, a new pre-trained GNN\nframework for crystalline materials, which captures both node and graph level\nstructural information of crystal graphs using a huge amount of unlabelled\nmaterial data. Further, we extract distilled knowledge from CrysGNN and inject\ninto different state of the art property predictors to enhance their property\nprediction accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments to show that with\ndistilled knowledge from the pre-trained model, all the SOTA algorithms are\nable to outperform their own vanilla version with good margins. We also observe\nthat the distillation process provides a significant improvement over the\nconventional approach of finetuning the pre-trained model. We have released the\npre-trained model along with the large dataset of 800K crystal graph which we\ncarefully curated; so that the pretrained model can be plugged into any\nexisting and upcoming models to enhance their prediction accuracy.",

    "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials have wide applications in superconductors,\nquantum, and topological materials. However, their rational design is not well\nestablished, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D\nmaterials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density\nfunctional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed\nto discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a\ngenerative material design pipeline, namely material transformer\ngenerator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We\ntrain two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural\nlanguage models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The\nmodels are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions,\nwhich are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction.\nNext, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability\nbased on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new\nDFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including\nNiCl$_4$, IrSBr, CuBr$_3$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential\nof our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D\nmaterials and other functional materials.",

Among these applications, the inverse\ndesign of materials can contribute to explore materials with desired properties\nwithout relying on luck or serendipity. We propose neural structure fields\n(NeSF) as an accurate and practical approach for representing crystal\nstructures using neural networks. Inspired by the concepts of vector fields in\nphysics and implicit neural representations in computer vision, the proposed\nNeSF considers a crystal structure as a continuous field rather than as a\ndiscrete set of atoms. Unlike existing grid-based discretized spatial\nrepresentations, the NeSF overcomes the tradeoff between spatial resolution and\ncomputational complexity and can represent any crystal structure. We propose an\nautoencoder of crystal structures that can recover various crystal structures,\nsuch as those of perovskite structure materials and cuprate superconductors.\nExtensive quantitative results demonstrate the superior performance of the NeSF\ncompared with the existing grid-based approach.",

This work proposes a novel deep learning\nbased BERT transformer language model BERTOS for predicting the oxidation\nstates of all elements of inorganic compounds given only their chemical\ncomposition. Our model achieves 96.82\\% accuracy for all-element oxidation\nstates prediction benchmarked on the cleaned ICSD dataset and achieves 97.61\\%\naccuracy for oxide materials.

    "summary": "Data-driven machine learning methods have the potential to dramatically\naccelerate the rate of materials design over conventional human-guided\napproaches. These methods would help identify or, in the case of generative\nmodels, even create novel crystal structures of materials with a set of\nspecified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the\nlaboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in\ndeveloping suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the\nmachine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations\nused in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations\nthat are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while\nremaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing\nchallenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking\nexisting non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and\ndeveloping an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through\ngradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be\ncoupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials\nwithin the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian\nspace. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach\nusing atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional\nvariational autoencoders as the generative model. We are able to successfully\ngenerate novel and valid atomic structures of sub-nanometer Pt nanoparticles as\na proof of concept. Furthermore, this method can be readily extended to any\nsuitable structural representation, thereby providing a powerful, generalizable\nframework towards structure-based generation.",

It is thus crucial to be able to\nidentify accurately and efficiently if bulk three-dimensional (3D) materials\nare formed by layers held together by a weak binding energy that, thus, can be\npotentially exfoliated into 2D materials. In this work, we develop a\nmachine-learning (ML) approach that, combined with a fast preliminary\ngeometrical screening, is able to efficiently identify potentially exfoliable\nmaterials. Starting from a combination of descriptors for crystal structures,\nwe work out a subset of them that are crucial for accurate predictions. Our\nfinal ML model, based on a random forest classifier, has a very high recall of\n98\\%. Using a SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we also provide an\nintuitive explanation of the five most important variables of the model.\nFinally, we compare the performance of our best ML model with a deep neural\nnetwork architecture using the same descriptors. To make our algorithms and\nmodels easily accessible, we publish an online tool on the Materials Cloud\nportal that only requires a bulk 3D crystal structure as input.

This early stage discrimination combined\nwith evaluation of novelty of phase fields aligns with the outstanding\nexperimental challenge of identifying new areas of chemistry to investigate, by\nprioritising which elements to combine in a reaction. Here, we demonstrate that\nphase fields can be assessed with respect to the maximum expected value of a\ntarget functional property and ranked according to chemical novelty.

It is shown\nthat a binary classifier, trained on a large number of already identified\ncrystal structures, can determine the isomorphism of crystal structures formed\nby two given chemical compositions with an accuracy of approximately 96.4\\%.\nFor a given query composition with an unknown crystal structure, the model is\nused to automatically select from a crystal structure database a set of\ntemplate crystals with nearly identical stable structures to which element\nsubstitution is to be applied. Apart from the local relaxation calculation of\nthe identified templates, the proposed method does not use ab initio\ncalculations. The potential of this substation-based CSP is demonstrated for a\nwide variety of crystal systems.",

    "summary": "The success of machine learning (ML) in materials property prediction depends\nheavily on how the materials are represented for learning. Two dominant\nfamilies of material descriptors exist, one that encodes crystal structure in\nthe representation and the other that only uses stoichiometric information with\nthe hope of discovering new materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) in\nparticular have excelled in predicting material properties within chemical\naccuracy. However, current GNNs are limited to only one of the above two\navenues owing to the little overlap between respective material\nrepresentations. Here, we introduce a new concept of formula graph which\nunifies stoichiometry-only and structure-based material descriptors. We further\ndevelop a self-attention integrated GNN that assimilates a formula graph and\nshow that the proposed architecture produces material embeddings transferable\nbetween the two domains. Our model can outperform some previously proposed\nstructure-agnostic models and their structure-based counterparts while\nexhibiting better sample efficiency and faster convergence. Finally, the model\nis applied in a challenging exemplar to predict the complex dielectric function\nof materials and nominate new substances that potentially exhibit\nepsilon-near-zero phenomena.",

For random forests, we use a\nstochastic method to select nearly one hundred relevant descriptors based on\nchemical composition and crystal structure.

The comparison between these different\nmachine learning approaches gives an estimate of the errors for our predictions\non the ICSD database.

While\nheuristic knowledge based descriptors have been combined with ML algorithms to\nachieve good performance, the complexity of the physicochemical mechanisms\nmakes it urgently needed to exploit representation learning from either\ncompositions or structures for building highly effective materials machine\nlearning models. Among these methods, the graph neural networks have shown the\nbest performance by its capability to learn high-level features from crystal\nstructures. However, all these models suffer from their inability to scale up\nthe models due to the over-smoothing issue of their message-passing GNN\narchitecture. Here we propose a novel graph attention neural network model\nDeeperGATGNN with differentiable group normalization and skip-connections,\nwhich allows to train very deep graph neural network models (e.g. 30 layers\ncompared to 3-9 layers in previous works). Through systematic benchmark studies\nover six benchmark datasets for energy and band gap predictions, we show that\nour scalable DeeperGATGNN model needs little costly hyper-parameter tuning for\ndifferent datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performances\nover five properties out of six with up to 10\\% improvement.

Methods for visualizing the local\natomic structure, such as atom probe tomography (APT), which routinely generate\ndatasets comprised of millions of atoms, are an important step in realizing\nthis goal. However, state-of-the-art APT instruments generate noisy and sparse\ndatasets that provide information about elemental type, but obscure atomic\nstructures, thus limiting their subsequent value for materials discovery. The\napplication of a materials fingerprinting process, a machine learning algorithm\ncoupled with topological data analysis, provides an avenue by which\nhere-to-fore unprecedented structural information can be extracted from an APT\ndataset. As a proof of concept, the material fingerprint is applied to\nhigh-entropy alloy APT datasets containing body-centered cubic (BCC) and\nface-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structures. A local atomic configuration\ncentered on an arbitrary atom is assigned a topological descriptor, with which\nit can be characterized as a BCC or FCC lattice with near perfect accuracy,\ndespite the inherent noise in the dataset. This successful identification of a\nfingerprint is a crucial first step in the development of algorithms which can\nextract more nuanced information, such as chemical ordering, from existing\ndatasets of complex materials.",

    "summary": "Two dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising functional materials\nwith many applications such as semiconductors and photovoltaics because of\ntheir unique optoelectronic properties. While several thousand 2D materials\nhave been screened in existing materials databases, discovering new 2D\nmaterials remains to be challenging. Herein we propose a deep learning\ngenerative model for composition generation combined with random forest based\n2D materials classifier to discover new hypothetical 2D materials. Furthermore,\na template based element substitution structure prediction approach is\ndeveloped to predict the crystal structures of a subset of the newly predicted\nhypothetical formulas, which allows us to confirm their structure stability\nusing DFT calculations. So far, we have discovered 267,489 new potential 2D\nmaterials compositions and confirmed twelve 2D/layered materials by DFT\nformation energy calculation. Our results show that generative machine learning\nmodels provide an effective way to explore the vast chemical design space for\nnew 2D materials discovery.",

We\npresent a dataset of more than 100,000 structural relaxations of potential\nbattery anode materials from randomized structures using density functional\ntheory calculations. We illustrate the usage of the dataset by training graph\nneural networks to predict structural relaxations from randomly generated\nstructures. Our models directly predict stresses in addition to forces, which\nallows them to accurately simulate relaxations of both ionic positions and\nlattice vectors. We show that models trained on the molecular dynamics\nsimulations fail to simulate relaxations from random structures, while training\non our data leads to up to two orders of magnitude decrease in error for the\nsame task. Our model is able to find an experimentally verified structure of a\nstoichiometry held out from training. We find that randomly perturbing atomic\npositions during training improves both the accuracy and out of domain\ngeneralization of the models.",

    "summary": "Volumetric crystal structure indexing and orientation mapping are key data\nprocessing steps for virtually any quantitative study of spatial correlations\nbetween the local chemistry and the microstructure of a material. For electron\nand X-ray diffraction methods it is possible to develop indexing tools which\ncompare measured and analytically computed patterns to decode the structure and\nrelative orientation within local regions of interest. Consequently, a number\nof numerically efficient and automated software tools exist to solve the above\ncharacterisation tasks.\n  For atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, however, the strategy of making\ncomparisons between measured and analytically computed patterns is less robust\nbecause many APT datasets may contain substantial noise. Given that general\nenough predictive models for such noise remain elusive, crystallography tools\nfor APT face several limitations: Their robustness to noise, and therefore,\ntheir capability to identify and distinguish different crystal structures and\norientation is limited. In addition, the tools are sequential and demand\nsubstantial manual interaction. In combination, this makes robust uncertainty\nquantifying with automated high-throughput studies of the latent\ncrystallographic information a difficult task with APT data.\n  To improve the situation, we review the existent methods and discuss how they\nlink to those in the diffraction communities. With this we modify some of the\nAPT methods to yield more robust descriptors of the atomic arrangement. We\nreport how this enables the development of an open-source software tool for\nstrong-scaling and automated identifying of crystal structure and mapping\ncrystal orientation in nanocrystalline APT datasets with multiple phases.",

However, state-of-the-art\ngenerative models tend to be limited to a specific composition or crystal\nstructure. Herein, we present a framework capable of general inverse design\n(not limited to a given set of elements or crystal structures), featuring a\ngeneralized invertible representation that encodes crystals in both real and\nreciprocal space, and a property-structured latent space from a variational\nautoencoder (VAE). In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new\ncrystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE)\npower factor, and combinations thereof. These generated crystals, absent in the\ntraining database, are validated by first-principles calculations. The success\nrates (number of first-principles-validated target-satisfying crystals/number\nof designed crystals) ranges between 7.1% and 38.9%. These results represent a\nsignificant step toward property-driven general inverse design using generative\nmodels, although practical challenges remain when coupled with experimental\nsynthesis.",

    "summary": "Materials representation plays a key role in machine learning based\nprediction of materials properties and new materials discovery. Currently both\ngraph and 3D voxel representation methods are based on the heterogeneous\nelements of the crystal structures. Here, we propose to use electronic charge\ndensity (ECD) as a generic unified 3D descriptor for materials property\nprediction with the advantage of possessing close relation with the physical\nand chemical properties of materials. We developed an ECD based 3D\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting elastic properties of\nmaterials, in which CNNs can learn effective hierarchical features with\nmultiple convolving and pooling operations. Extensive benchmark experiments\nover 2,170 Fm-3m face-centered-cubic (FCC) materials show that our ECD based\nCNNs can achieve good performance for elasticity prediction. Especially, our\nCNN models based on the fusion of elemental Magpie features and ECD descriptors\nachieved the best 5-fold cross-validation performance. More importantly, we\nshowed that our ECD based CNN models can achieve significantly better\nextrapolation performance when evaluated over non-redundant datasets where\nthere are few neighbor training samples around test samples. As additional\nvalidation, we evaluated the predictive performance of our models on 329\nmaterials of space group Fm-3m by comparing to DFT calculated values, which\nshows better prediction power of our model for bulk modulus than shear modulus.\nDue to the unified representation power of ECD, it is expected that our ECD\nbased CNN approach can also be applied to predict other physical and chemical\nproperties of crystalline materials.",

In the natural sciences, generative models have led\nto rapid progress in automated drug discovery. Many of the current methods\nfocus on either 1-D or 2-D representations of typically small, drug-like\nmolecules. However, many molecules require 3-D descriptors and exceed the\nchemical complexity of commonly used dataset. We present a method to encode and\ndecode the position of atoms in 3-D molecules from a dataset of nearly 50,000\nstable crystal unit cells that vary from containing 1 to over 100 atoms. We\nconstruct a smooth and continuous 3-D density representation of each crystal\nbased on the positions of different atoms. Two different neural networks were\ntrained on a dataset of over 120,000 three-dimensional samples of single and\nrepeating crystal structures, made by rotating the single unit cells. The\nfirst, an Encoder-Decoder pair, constructs a compressed latent space\nrepresentation of each molecule and then decodes this description into an\naccurate reconstruction of the input. The second network segments the resulting\noutput into atoms and assigns each atom an atomic number. By generating\ncompressed, continuous latent spaces representations of molecules we are able\nto decode random samples, interpolate between two molecules, and alter known\nmolecules.",

Given a set of multiple cost functions that\nhave qualitatively different distributions of local minima with each other, the\nproposed method finds the common minima with a high success rate without the\nhelp of any metaheuristics. As a demonstration, we apply the COM to the crystal\nstructure prediction in materials science.
