    "summary": "The increasing complexity and volume of data generated by high-throughput\ncomputational materials science require robust tools to ensure their\naccessibility, reproducibility, and reuse. In particular, integrating the FAIR\nGuiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) into\ncomputational workflows is essential to enable open science practices. TribChem\nis an open source Python software developed for the automated simulation of\nsolid-solid interfaces using density functional theory (DFT). While TribChem\nalready incorporates several FAIR-aligned features, we present here a dedicated\nFAIR utility designed to transform TribChem results into FAIR-compliant\ndatasets. This utility comprises two tools: fair_data.py, which automatically\ngenerates standardized machine- and human-readable outputs from the TribChem\ndatabase, and retrieve_data.py, which facilitates efficient data extraction\nthrough a keyword-based interface. In this paper we show the capabilities of\nthe fair utility with examples for bulk, surface, and interface systems. The\nimplementation allows seamless integration with public repositories such as\nZenodo, paving the way for reproducible research and fostering data-driven\nmaterials discovery.",

    "summary": "Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding\nchallenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property\nrelationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable\nmodels for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density\n$w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a\nminimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated\ndataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed\nDigital Hydrogen Platform (\\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from\navailable experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we\nsystematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using\ncombinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final\nclosed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive\naccuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while\nmaintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design\nmaps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and\n$P_{\\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive\nelements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type\nhydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite\ntrend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare\ncandidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to\nthe unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models\nindicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching\nthese benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for\nmaterials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery\nof materials in complex chemical spaces.",

    "summary": "Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces\nwhile satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided\nEvolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the\nscientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed\nevolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM\nproposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property\nconstraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;\nand a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide\nsubsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,\nenergy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are\nchemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving\nhigher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only\nbaselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,\nmemory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing\nsynthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled\npathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.\n  Code: https://github.com/scientific-discovery/LLEMA",

    "summary": "Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts\n(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to\nscientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain\nexpertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven\nanalogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),\ntrained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool\nfor analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can\ngenerate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and\nanalogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant\nsubstitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few\nlabeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical\nreasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces\nand outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as\ninterpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven\ngeneralization for scientific innovation.",
