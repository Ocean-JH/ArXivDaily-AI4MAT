    "summary": "Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials\ndesign by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained\nproperty predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is\nhindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such\nas charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local\nminima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these\nissues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive\nCrystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and\ntemplate-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid\npoor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without\nretraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional\ntargets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal\nsystems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced\nwith gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five\ntarget properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and\nBayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite\nstructures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at\nwhich the other methods fail entirely.",
