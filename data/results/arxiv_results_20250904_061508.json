    "summary": "Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully\ndefines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with\nhigh accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models\nare constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.\nHere, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which\ncouples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and\nbasis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1%\nerror), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems.\nBuilding on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model\ncovering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot\nperformance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training\ndistribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure\ncalculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities,\nEAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure\nprediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.",
