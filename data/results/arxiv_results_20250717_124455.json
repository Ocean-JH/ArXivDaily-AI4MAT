    "summary": "The geometric design of structures with optimized physical and chemical\nproperties is one of the core topics in materials science. However, designing\nnew functional materials is challenging due to the vast number of existing and\nthe possible unknown structures to be enumerated and difficulties in mining the\nunderlying correlations between structures and their properties. Here, we\npropose a universal method for periodic structural design and property\noptimization. The key in our approach is a deep-learning assisted inverse\nFourier transform, which enables the creation of arbitrary geometries within\ncrystallographic space groups. It effectively explores extensive parameter\nspaces to identify ideal structures with desired properties. Taking the\nresearch of three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures as a case study, this\nmethod is capable of modelling numerous structures and identifying their\nphotonic bandgaps in just a few hours. We confirmed the established knowledge\nthat the widest photonic bandgaps exist in network morphologies, among which\nthe single diamond (dia net) reigns supreme. Additionally, this method\nidentified a rarely-known lcs topology with excellent photonic properties,\nhighlighting the infinitely extensible application boundaries of our approach.\nThis work demonstrates the high efficiency and effectiveness of the\nFourier-based method, advancing material design and providing insights for\nnext-generation functional materials.",

By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained\nBinary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling\ncapabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust\ngeneralization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical\nbaselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves,\nHeusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both\ncross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally\nsynthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and\nmeasured phases.

    "summary": "The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological\nadvancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must\neffectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite\ndesign space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMatG), a unifying\nframework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline\nmaterials. OMatG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary\nbase distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad\nclass of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and\nflow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by\nintegrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and\nextending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell\nrepresentations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates\nand lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We\nbenchmark OMatG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)\nfor specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering\nstable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMatG,\nwe refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMatG\nestablishes a new state of the art in generative modeling for materials\ndiscovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.\nThese results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning\nframeworks to accelerate progress in materials science.

Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free,\ntransformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire\nmany-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention\nmechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field\nstates. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in\npredicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE)\nformalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton\noscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is\ntrained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute\nerror (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and\nexciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that\nthe attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body\ncorrelations.

Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional\nquantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in\nestimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor\ngeneralization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical\ninterpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed\nAdaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two\nmain issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new\nsynthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples\nacross various materials and configurations, reducing the need for\ntime-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\\varphi$-Adapt, a\nphysics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between\nmodels trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.\nExperimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

    "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular\nproperty prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to\neffectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as\nmolecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely\nlimiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily\nfocus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods\noften rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,\nwhile equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module\nleveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)\nrotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational\ninvariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment\nstrategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.\nExperimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior\npredictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to\nexisting methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational\ncomplexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for\nefficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery\nand material design.",

    "summary": "Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures\nachieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for\nrecent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization\nmethods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces\nand the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine\nlearning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review\nframes ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of\nrepresentation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and\ninput-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in\nthe solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates\noptimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact,\nlatent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient\nglobal exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique\ntrade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design\ndiscovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization\nwith data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve\nscalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting\nopen challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management,\ngeometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints,\nand advancements in multiphysics co-designs.",

    "summary": "Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing\nparameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in\nmaterials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited\ntraining micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To\novercome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling\napproach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art\ntext-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method\nintroduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing\ntemperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,\nenabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and\ncapturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity\nand computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the\nmodel's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently\ntransferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism\nusing a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16\nencoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean\nIoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical\ndescriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and\nreal microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path\nerrors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the\nfirst adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,\noffering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.",

    "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials\ndiscovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this\nwork, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration\nof charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds -\nagainst four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational\nautoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established\nmethods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are\nstable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast,\ngenerative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when\nsufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties\nsuch as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of\nboth the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation\nscreening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability\nand property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including\nuniversal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to\nsubstantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains\ncomputationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward\nmore effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing\nbaselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued\nadvancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of\nnovel materials that are thermodynamically stable.",

Automated characterization of material structures with machine\nlearning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in\nmaterial design.

Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on\nhigh-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use\ndiffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal\nstructures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing\nchallenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative\nassessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces\nstructures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably,\ndeCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental\ndiffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for\ncrystal structure characterization.",

    "summary": "Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and\nfunctionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often\nwell-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always\nconsistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by\nmajor funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving\ninsights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems,\nbenchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient\nand analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new\nAPIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics\nfor automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation.\nYet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the\nimpact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization.\nHackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML\nresearchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel\nsolutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for\ninstrumentation, materials science, and applied ML.

Their inverse\ndesign - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is\nchallenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and\noptical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local\nminima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we\naddress these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of\ndiffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,\nwe generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their\ncorresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional\ndiffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial\npower distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous\nsupported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low\nerror, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an\ninitializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach\non the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam\nsplitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, the classification of magnetic\norders, even for the most fundamental concepts like ferromagnetism (FM) and\nantiferromagnetism (AFM), has encountered unprecedented challenges since the\ndiscovery of unconventional magnets and advancements in antiferromagnetic\nspintronics. Here, we present a rigorous classification of magnetic order using\nstate-of-the-art spin space group (SSG) theory. Based on whether the net\nmagnetic moment is constrained to zero by SSG, magnetic order is unambiguously\ndichotomized into FM (including ferrimagnetism) and AFM. Additionally, we\nclassify AFM geometries into four categories -- primary, bi-color, spiral, and\nmulti-axial -- based on periodic spin propagation beyond the symmetry\noperations of magnetic space groups. We then introduce a distinct magnetic\nphase, dubbed spin-orbit magnetism, characterized by its unique behavior\ninvolving the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) order parameter and SOC-driven phase\ntransition. We further create an oriented SSG description, i.e., SSG with a\nfixed magnetic configuration, apply the framework to 2,065 experimentally\nvalidated magnetic materials in MAGNDATA database, and identify over 220\nspin-orbit magnets with distinct spin and orbital magnetization mechanisms.\nImplemented by the online program FINDSPINGROUP, our work establishes a\nuniversal symmetry standard for magnetic order classification, offering new\nunderstandings of unconventional magnets and broad applicability in spintronics\nand quantum material design.",

    "summary": "The development of machine-learning models for atomic-scale simulations has\nbenefited tremendously from the large databases of materials and molecular\nproperties computed in the past two decades using electronic-structure\ncalculations. More recently, these databases have made it possible to train\nuniversal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic\ngeometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was\nhowever in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted\nprimarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the\nmost accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation\ndetails to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed\nspecifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable\npredictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different\nphilosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the\ndataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively\ndistorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability\nof the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other\nhand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most\naccurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort.\nThe MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures,\nhas already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that\nare competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three\norders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and\ndetails of the construction of the MAD dataset. We also introduce a\nlow-dimensional structural latent space that allows us to compare it with other\npopular datasets and that can be used as a general-purpose materials\ncartography tool.",

In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to\npredict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally\nefficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation\ntheory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the\nComputational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections\nbetween cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic\nproperties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with\npronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian\nprocess regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest\nexciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process.

    "summary": "Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal\nstructures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic\nsimulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced\nthe computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures\nacross the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a\nsignificant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based\nCSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to\nefficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of\ncrystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between\nconvex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization.\nOur evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware\nrandom structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials.\nWe demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP\n(PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT\ncalculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal\nstructures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal\nNNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in\nmaterials discovery.",

Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding\noptical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.\nHowever, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical\nsimulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this\npaper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission\nspectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural\nnetwork (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly\ndegrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,\nthe TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural\nnetwork and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been\nimplemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we\npropose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We\nshow that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the\nlongest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a\nCNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed\nbecause it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.",

While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative\nmodels have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more\nrapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and\nperiodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling\nstructures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell.

Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on\nan augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning\nstructure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known\nlow-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the\nground-state energy of graphite.

    "summary": "Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing\nhigh-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and\nengineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.\nOffline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using\npre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional\napproaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and\ngenerating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based\nframework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score\ninterdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and\nscore spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward\ngeneration, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its\nderivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive\ninference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10\nmulti-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including\nsynthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world\nengineering optimization.",

    "summary": "A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an\nunknown function to predict values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics,\npredictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance\nthat balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions.\nHowever, over-parameterized models exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as\n\"double descent\" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing\ngeneralization error. Others may exhibit more complicated patterns of\npredictive error with multiple peaks and valleys. Neither double descent nor\nmultiple descent phenomena are well explained by the bias-variance\ndecomposition.\n  We introduce a novel decomposition that we call the generalized aliasing\ndecomposition (GAD) to explain the relationship between predictive performance\nand model complexity. The GAD decomposes the predictive error into three parts:\n1) model insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much\nsmaller than the number of data points, 2) data insufficiency, which dominates\nwhen the number of parameters is much greater than the number of data points,\nand 3) generalized aliasing, which dominates between these two extremes.\n  We demonstrate the applicability of the GAD to diverse applications,\nincluding random feature models from machine learning, Fourier transforms from\nsignal processing, solution methods for differential equations, and predictive\nformation enthalpy in materials discovery. Because key components of the GAD\ncan be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and\nsamples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to\nexperimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing\nexperiments. We further demonstrate this approach on several examples and\ndiscuss implications for predictive modeling and data science.",

However, real-world design practices often require\nnon-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and\nnear-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design\nexploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a\ntarget transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound\nsingle-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional\ndistributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent\n``map\", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions\" into uniquely equivalent\nphysical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional\ndependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate\nDCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in\ndesign error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better\nfit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.",

    "summary": "The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific\nproperties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the\nimmense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional\ncomputational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density\nfunctional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at\nscale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging\ndata-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of\nMOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates\nboth opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To\naddress these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced,\ntransformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our\napproach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both\nconnectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline\ncomprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid\nsequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a\nreinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via\nproperty-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into\nsequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable,\ntopologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work\ndemonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with\nreinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and\nunlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.",

    "summary": "Materials design aims to discover novel compounds with desired properties.\nHowever, prevailing strategies face critical trade-offs. Conventional\nelement-substitution approaches readily and adaptively incorporate various\ndomain knowledge but remain confined to a narrow search space. In contrast,\ndeep generative models efficiently explore vast compositional landscapes, yet\nthey struggle to flexibly integrate domain knowledge. To address these\ntrade-offs, we propose a gradient-based material design framework that combines\nthese strengths, offering both efficiency and adaptability. In our method,\nchemical compositions are optimised to achieve target properties by using\nproperty prediction models and their gradients. In order to seamlessly enforce\ndiverse constraints, including those reflecting domain insights such as\noxidation states, discretised compositional ratios, types of elements, and\ntheir abundance, we apply masks and employ a special loss function, namely the\ninteger loss. Furthermore, we initialise the optimisation using promising\ncandidates from existing dataset, effectively guiding the search away from\nunfavourable regions and thus helping to avoid poor solutions. Our approach\ndemonstrates a more efficient exploration of superconductor candidates,\nuncovering candidate materials with higher critical temperature than\nconventional element-substitution and generative models. Importantly, it could\npropose new compositions beyond those found in existing databases, including\nnew hydride superconductors absent from the training dataset but which share\ncompositional similarities with materials found in literature. This synergy of\ndomain knowledge and machine-learning-based scalability provides a robust\nfoundation for rapid, adaptive, and comprehensive materials design for\nsuperconductors and beyond.",

    "summary": "HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based\npartial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse\ndesign of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological\noptimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE)\nand a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by\ngenerating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs.\nShortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters,\nproduce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a\ncompact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize\ngeometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused\nfor alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition\nfunction. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB\nsystematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer\nelectromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the\ntotal number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude,\naccelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its\nefficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green,\nand blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while\nmitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing\ndemonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust,\nmulti-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation\nnanophotonic challenges.",

    "summary": "In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language\nprocessing (QNLP) to inverse design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with\ntargeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 450 hypothetical MOF structures\nconsisting of 3 topologies, 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we\ncategorize these structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and\n$CO_{2}$ Henry's constant values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the\nbag-of-words, DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical), and\nsequence-based models) to identify the most effective approach to process the\nMOF dataset. Using a classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the\nbag-of-words model is identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation\naccuracies of 88.6% and 78.0% for binary classification tasks on pore volume\nand $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Further, we developed multi-class\nclassification models tailored to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits,\nwith average test accuracies of 92% and 80% across different classes for pore\nvolume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant datasets. Finally, the performance of\ngenerating MOF with target properties showed accuracies of 93.5% for pore\nvolume and 87% for $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Although our\ninvestigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF search space, it marks a\npromising first step towards using quantum computing for materials design,\noffering a new perspective through which to explore the complex landscape of\nMOFs.",

However, inevitable outliers in\nempirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to\nerroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently\nby integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective\nre-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical\neffectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset\ncontaining 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass\ntransition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density\n($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance\nimprovements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net,\nSVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method\nreliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy\nwith minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the\ndataset to be re-measured. These findings highlight the importance of data\nquality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in\npolymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive\nreliability in materials science.",

Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the\nproficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the\ngeneration and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based\ncomputational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two\ncomplementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA)\nbenchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated\nmethodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use\nexamples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials\nGenomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the\nability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world\nbenchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of\nfunctional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of\ndiverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine\nspecialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better.

These\nprojects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property\nprediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel\ninterfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data\nmanagement and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7)\nknowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature.\nCollectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile\npredictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools,\nand much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary\nLLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data,\nand new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data\nenvironments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their\nintegration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new\nchallenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further\nresearch to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.",

    "summary": "Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific\nproperties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis,\nenergy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion\nprinciples can directly produce new materials that meet performance\nconstraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process.\nHowever, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures\noften remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel\ninverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is\nbased on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize\nthe material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired\nperformance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the\nInvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\\AA}, representing an 32.96%\nimprovement in performance compared to exsisting generative models.\nAdditionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of\nlow-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate\nmaterials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously\nexpanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative\nmodel in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove\nthe effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors\nunder ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we\nsuccessfully identified Li\\(_2\\)AuH\\(_6\\) as a conventional BCS superconductor\nwith an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides\nstrong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials\nscience.",

    "summary": "The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the\nchallenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid\norganic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their\nexceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric\ndeep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong\npotential in predicting material properties and guiding material design.\nHowever, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and\nhigher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes\n(QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material\nproperty prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex,\nwhich encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying\ndimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our\nmodel leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them\nusing a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark\ndatasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP\ndatasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in\nHOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex\nrepresentation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for\npredictive modeling of perovskite materials.",

    "summary": "Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has\nrevolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often\nstruggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized\nthrough kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between\ntheoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a\nsynthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure\nderivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the\nefficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable\nstructures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based\nsynthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized\nstructures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab\ninitio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The\nframework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn,\nFe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting\nsynthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the\n554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising\nsynthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X =\nTi, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$\ncandidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for\nexperimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally\nobserved temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a\ndata-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials\nsynthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational\npredictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for\nthe targeted discovery of novel functional materials.",

    "summary": "Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials\ndiscovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials\nwith desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for\ncrystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to\nseparately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These\nmethods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising,\nwhich can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we\nintroduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that\njointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline\nmaterials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices,\nDiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules,\nenabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and\nlattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic\nsymmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it\nto scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied\nDiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high\nsaturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable,\ndiverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.",

We use a multimode resonance structure to\ndemonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure.\nTherefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart\nfilter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual\nneural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design\ntechniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved\ngeneralization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to\ngenerate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy\ninspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network\n(HiFR\\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate\nthat the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy\ncompared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical\nmetrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements. To validate\nthe proposed framework, we first design and fabricate a three-resonance SIW\nstructure.

Nevertheless, one can tune\nfeatures of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to\nspecific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the\nstructure. This has been understood through the notion of independent\nbond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs\nhave different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated\ninverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified\nin a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse\ndesign. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the\nsimultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much\nstronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the\nmechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across\na wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable\nparameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our\nformulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter\nchanges, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability.\nThese results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference\nbetween ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to\nboth understand and perform inverse design.",

In this work we developed a highly\ntransferable, efficient and robust conditional generation framework, PODGen, by\nintegrating a general generative model with multiple property prediction\nmodels. Based on PODGen, we designed a workflow for the high-throughput\ncrystals conditional generation which is used to search new topological\ninsulators (TIs). Our results show that the success rate of generating TIs\nusing our framework is 5.3 times higher than that of the unconstrained\napproach. More importantly, while general methods rarely produce gapped TIs,\nour framework succeeds consistently, highlighting an effectively $\\infty$\nimprovement. This demonstrates that conditional generation significantly\nenhances the efficiency of targeted material discovery. Using this method, we\ngenerated tens of thousands of new topological materials and conducted further\nfirst-principles calculations on those with promising application potential.\nFurthermore, we identified promising, synthesizable topological (crystalline)\ninsulators such as CsHgSb, NaLaB$_{12}$, Bi$_4$Sb$_2$Se$_3$, Be$_3$Ta$_2$Si and\nBe$_2$W.",

    "summary": "Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic\nsurface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them\npromising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices.\nTraditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion\nvia strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC\noften remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design\nstrategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin\nHall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in\nan inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that\nwhile the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant\nSOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial\ntopological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a\ndelicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron\ntunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the\nbilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an\nexternal electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of\ncontrolling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further\nvalidate this interplay, by revealing g-factor suppression and the emergence a\nzeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a\nrobust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of\nstate-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway\nfor designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems\nusing topologically trivial constituent monolayers.",

    "summary": "Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with\ncomplex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material\nfailure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in\ntwo-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the\nprediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical\nengineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are\nlimited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep\nlearning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions.\nExisting Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven\nsupervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints,\nwhich provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed\na stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed\nMultiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution\nmaterial microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the\nmicrostructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive\nprediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed\nNeural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By\nintroducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not\nrequire paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of\nstress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress\nconcentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress\nanalysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states\nthrough transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction\nframework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.",

Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in\nmaterials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in\ntwo-phase random materials (TRMs).

We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's\nability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of\nthe generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a\nlarge number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a\nrepresentative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the\nlargest known in this category.",

    "summary": "Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective\nfunction using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span\nvarious domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular\nengineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using\nexisting designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new\ndesigns through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model.\nThis method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate\nmodel may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based\nOptimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly\noptimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing\ngradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design\ncandidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be\ninvalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this\nchallenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates,\nwe propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We\nintroduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them\nwith a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with\nthe distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO\ntasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is\ncompetitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.",

A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched\nwith a curated RON database, is used for model training.

An independent regression model is then\nused to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is\nemployed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising\nfuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the\nlimitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex\nstructure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation.\nThe generative model provides a flexible tool for systematically exploring vast\nchemical spaces, paving the way for discovering fuels with superior anti-knock\nproperties.

This enhancement enables efficient training on irregular\ngrids and varying geometries while allowing seamless evaluation of physics\nlosses at randomly sampled points for improved generalization. For a PDE\nexample on regular grids, mGNO paired with autograd reduced the L2 relative\ndata error by 20x compared to finite differences, although training was slower.\nIt can also solve PDEs on unstructured point clouds seamlessly, using physics\nlosses only, at resolutions vastly lower than those needed for finite\ndifferences to be accurate enough. On these unstructured point clouds, mGNO\nleads to errors that are consistently 2 orders of magnitude lower than machine\nlearning baselines (Meta-PDE) for comparable runtimes, and also delivers\nspeedups from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the numerical solver for\nsimilar accuracy. mGNOs can also be used to solve inverse design and shape\noptimization problems on complex geometries.",

While LLMs offer promising\nfew- and zero-shot learning capabilities, particularly valuable in the\nmaterials domain where expert annotations are scarce, general-purpose LLMs\noften fail to address key materials-specific queries without further\nadaptation. To bridge this gap, fine-tuning LLMs on human-labeled data is\nessential for effective structured knowledge extraction. In this study, we\nintroduce a novel annotation schema designed to extract generic\nprocess-structure-properties relationships from scientific literature. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this approach using a dataset of 128 abstracts, with\nannotations drawn from two distinct domains: high-temperature materials (Domain\nI) and uncertainty quantification in simulating materials microstructure\n(Domain II). Initially, we developed a conditional random field (CRF) model\nbased on MatBERT, a domain-specific BERT variant, and evaluated its performance\non Domain I. Subsequently, we compared this model with a fine-tuned LLM (GPT-4o\nfrom OpenAI) under identical conditions. Our results indicate that fine-tuning\nLLMs can significantly improve entity extraction performance over the BERT-CRF\nbaseline on Domain I. However, when additional examples from Domain II were\nincorporated, the performance of the BERT-CRF model became comparable to that\nof the GPT-4o model.

RAFFLE's\neffectiveness is demonstrated across a diverse set of systems, including bulk\nmaterials, intercalation structures, and interfaces. When tested on bulk\naluminium and MoS$_2$, it successfully identifies known ground-state and\nhigh-pressure phases. Applied to intercalation systems, it predicts stable\nintercalant phases. For Si|Ge interfaces, RAFFLE identifies intermixing as a\nstrain compensation mechanism, generating reconstructions that are more stable\nthan abrupt interfaces. By accelerating interface structure prediction, RAFFLE\noffers a powerful tool for materials discovery, enabling efficient exploration\nof complex configuration spaces.",

In this paper, using density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations, we show that the electronic occupancy at the Fermi level, N(Ef),\nobtained from DOS is a key descriptor of alloy strength and ductility. Our\ncomprehensive analysis of numerous body centered cubic (BCC) refractory high\nentropy alloys (RHEAs) shows an overwhelming correlation that low N(Ef)\nindicates strong bonds that have high stiffness resulting in high elastic\nconstants. High bond stiffness indicates presence of covalent nature of bonds\nthat are directional in nature resulting in resistance to deformation leading\nto high bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli. Consequently, N(Ef) provides a direct\ncorrelation to the tendency of alloy ductility evidenced in the Pugh ratio\n(G/B). As stiffer bonds result in lower local lattice distortion (LLD), N(Ef)\nare LLD are also found to be corelated which opens up a correlation to solid\nsolution strengthening and yield strength. Thus, this work unveils fundamental\ncorrelations between N(Ef) and (1) elastic bond strength, (2) ductility, and\n(3) LLD. These correlations open opportunities for the design of high strength\nhigh ductile RHEAs.",

Most data-driven efforts have been focused on\nreducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for\nsolving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine\nlearning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In\nthis work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework\nbased on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly\nupdates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by\ntraditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various\nsystems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid,\ndemonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural,\ndynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows\nfor forecast intervals up to $30\\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps,\ngenerating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than\n4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended\ntimescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical\nphenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments.

    "summary": "Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing\nthe generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific\ndownstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the\nguidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions\nto be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are\noften unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable,\nsuch as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug\ndiscovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\\textbf{online}$ algorithm\ncapable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\\textbf{black-box}$\nobjective function. Moreover, the $\\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm\nis also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often\nexpensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple\nalgorithm, $\\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target\ngeneration. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to\nupdate the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction,\nwhich is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation.

The\nmain difficulty lies in accurately estimating the objective landscape beyond\nthe available data, where extrapolations are fraught with significant epistemic\nuncertainty. This uncertainty can lead to objective hacking(reward hacking),\nexploiting model inaccuracies in unseen regions, or other spurious\noptimizations that yield misleadingly high performance estimates outside the\ntraining distribution. Recent advances in model-based optimization(MBO) have\nharnessed the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks to develop\noffline-specific surrogate and generative models. Trained with carefully\ndesigned strategies, these models are more robust against out-of-distribution\nissues, facilitating the discovery of improved designs.

We begin by formalizing the problem for both single-objective and\nmulti-objective settings and by reviewing recent benchmarks and evaluation\nmetrics. We then categorize existing approaches into two key areas: surrogate\nmodeling, which emphasizes accurate function approximation in\nout-of-distribution regions, and generative modeling, which explores\nhigh-dimensional design spaces to identify high-performing designs.

    "summary": "Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been\ncontrollably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal\ndichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first\nprinciples materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and\nW in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge\ntransition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with\nspin-triplet ground states and a zero field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz\n(THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple\nto resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high\nfidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS\nimplies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher\ntemperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward\nthe possibility of realizing a single photon THz emitter. This work broadens\nthe scope of quantum defects, laying the foundation for next generation THz\nquantum technologies, a timely and significant research area given the rapid\nadvancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.",

Property-directed\ngenerative design has emerged as a transformative approach for rapidly\ndiscovering new functional inorganic materials with multiple desired properties\nwithin vast and complex search spaces. However, this approach faces two primary\nchallenges: data scarcity for functional properties and the multi-objective\noptimization required to balance competing tasks. Here, we present a\nmulti-property-directed generative framework designed to overcome these\nlimitations and enhance site symmetry-compliant crystal generation beyond P1\n(translational) symmetry. By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data\naugmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse\nand small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials\nsimultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation\nenergy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically\nand lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and\ncubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their\nthermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability\nfor thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents\na significant step forward in generative design of inorganic materials.",

    "summary": "Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets or GFNs) are probabilistic models\npredicated on Markov flows, and they employ specific amortization algorithms to\nlearn stochastic policies that generate compositional substances including\nbiomolecules, chemical materials, etc. With a strong ability to generate\nhigh-performance biochemical molecules, GFNs accelerate the discovery of\nscientific substances, effectively overcoming the time-consuming,\nlabor-intensive, and costly shortcomings of conventional material discovery\nmethods. However, previous studies rarely focus on accumulating exploratory\nexperience by adjusting generative structures, which leads to disorientation in\ncomplex sampling spaces. Efforts to address this issue, such as LS-GFN, are\nlimited to local greedy searches and lack broader global adjustments. This\npaper introduces a novel variant of GFNs, the Dynamic Backtracking GFN\n(DB-GFN), which improves the adaptability of decision-making steps through a\nreward-based dynamic backtracking mechanism. DB-GFN allows backtracking during\nthe network construction process according to the current state's reward value,\nthereby correcting disadvantageous decisions and exploring alternative pathways\nduring the exploration process. When applied to generative tasks involving\nbiochemical molecules and genetic material sequences, DB-GFN outperforms GFN\nmodels such as LS-GFN and GTB, as well as traditional reinforcement learning\nmethods, in sample quality, sample exploration quantity, and training\nconvergence speed. Additionally, owing to its orthogonal nature, DB-GFN shows\ngreat potential in future improvements of GFNs, and it can be integrated with\nother strategies to achieve higher search performance.",

    "summary": "Graph neural network universal interatomic potentials (GNN-UIPs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities in material\ndiscovery and property prediction. These models can accelerate molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulation by several orders of magnitude while maintaining\n\\textit{ab initio} accuracy, making them a promising new paradigm in material\nsimulations. One notable example is Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network\n(CHGNet), pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments\nfrom the MPtrj dataset, representing a state-of-the-art GNN-UIP model for\ncharge-informed MD simulations. However, training the CHGNet model is\ntime-consuming(8.3 days on one A100 GPU) for three reasons: (i) requiring\nmulti-layer propagation to reach more distant atom information, (ii) requiring\nsecond-order derivatives calculation to finish weights updating and (iii) the\nimplementation of reference CHGNet does not fully leverage the computational\ncapabilities. This paper introduces FastCHGNet, an optimized CHGNet, with three\ncontributions: Firstly, we design innovative Force/Stress Readout modules to\ndecompose Force/Stress prediction. Secondly, we adopt massive optimizations\nsuch as kernel fusion, redundancy bypass, etc, to exploit GPU computation power\nsufficiently. Finally, we extend CHGNet to support multiple GPUs and propose a\nload-balancing technique to enhance GPU utilization. Numerical results show\nthat FastCHGNet reduces memory footprint by a factor of 3.59. The final\ntraining time of FastCHGNet can be decreased to \\textbf{1.53 hours} on 32 GPUs\nwithout sacrificing model accuracy.",

Both algorithms are able to successfully\nextrapolate to heteroacene structures with lower $\\lambda$ than in the initial\ndataset, demonstrating good generalization capabilities even when the amount of\ninitial data is limited. We observe an improvement in the quality of the\npredicted compounds as the number of encoding bits $N$ increases, which offers\nan exciting prospect for applying the algorithms to richer chemical spaces that\nrequire larger values of $N$ and hence, in perspective, larger quantum circuits\nto deploy the proposed quantum-enhanced protocols.",

This\nPerspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex\nmaterials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner.

While universal\nMLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium\nproperties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase\ntransitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical\ninstabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in\nexchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic\ninteractions governing dynamic behavior.

    "summary": "In recent years, pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed\nas general models which can be effectively fine-tuned for various potential\ndownstream tasks in materials science, and have shown significant improvements\nin accuracy and data efficiency. The most widely used pre-training methods\ncurrently involve either supervised training to fit a general force field or\nself-supervised training by denoising atomic structures equilibrium. Both\nmethods require datasets generated from quantum mechanical calculations, which\nquickly become intractable when scaling to larger datasets. Here we propose a\nnovel pre-training objective which instead uses cheaply-computed structural\nfingerprints as targets while maintaining comparable performance across a range\nof different structural descriptors. Our experiments show this approach can act\nas a general strategy for pre-training GNNs with application towards large\nscale foundational models for atomistic data.",

    "summary": "Inverse design has emerged as a transformative approach for photonic device\noptimization, enabling the exploration of high-dimensional, non-intuitive\ndesign spaces to create ultra-compact devices and advance photonic integrated\ncircuits (PICs) in computing and interconnects. However, practical challenges,\nsuch as suboptimal device performance, limited manufacturability, high\nsensitivity to variations, computational inefficiency, and lack of\ninterpretability, have hindered its adoption in commercial hardware. Recent\nadvancements in AI-assisted photonic simulation and design offer transformative\npotential, accelerating simulations and design generation by orders of\nmagnitude over traditional numerical methods. Despite these breakthroughs, the\nlack of an open-source, standardized infrastructure and evaluation benchmark\nlimits accessibility and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address this, we\nintroduce MAPS, a multi-fidelity AI-augmented photonic simulation and inverse\ndesign infrastructure designed to bridge this gap. MAPS features three\nsynergistic components: (1) MAPS-Data: A dataset acquisition framework for\ngenerating multi-fidelity, richly labeled devices, providing high-quality data\nfor AI-for-optics research. (2) MAPS-Train: A flexible AI-for-photonics\ntraining framework offering a hierarchical data loading pipeline, customizable\nmodel construction, support for data- and physics-driven losses, and\ncomprehensive evaluations. (3) MAPS-InvDes: An advanced adjoint inverse design\ntoolkit that abstracts complex physics but exposes flexible optimization steps,\nintegrates pre-trained AI models, and incorporates fabrication variation\nmodels. This infrastructure MAPS provides a unified, open-source platform for\ndeveloping, benchmarking, and advancing AI-assisted photonic design workflows,\naccelerating innovation in photonic hardware optimization and scientific\nmachine learning.",

Yet in\npractice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic\npathways. Here we present an efficient machine learning-guided design algorithm\nto identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the\nthermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show\nthat optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility\nof a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the\nextent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly\nconditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition\namong alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which\nfavor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing\npolymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for\nmulti-objective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs\nbetween crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing\npolymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms\nthat optimize for kinetic accessibility.",

    "summary": "3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material design.\nWhile prior efforts focus on 3D diffusion models for their benefits in modeling\ncontinuous 3D conformers, they overlook the advantages of 1D SELFIES-based\nLanguage Models (LMs), which can generate 100% valid molecules and leverage the\nbillion-scale 1D molecule datasets. To combine these advantages for 3D molecule\ngeneration, we propose a foundation model -- NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D\nLanguage Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation. NExT-Mol uses an extensively\npretrained molecule LM for 1D molecule generation, and subsequently predicts\nthe generated molecule's 3D conformers with a 3D diffusion model. We enhance\nNExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the\ndiffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning.\nNotably, our 1D molecule LM significantly outperforms baselines in\ndistributional similarity while ensuring validity, and our 3D diffusion model\nachieves leading performances in conformer prediction. Given these improvements\nin 1D and 3D modeling, NExT-Mol achieves a 26% relative improvement in 3D FCD\nfor de novo 3D generation on GEOM-DRUGS, and a 13% average relative gain for\nconditional 3D generation on QM9-2014.

We benchmark CRAG-MoWs across small molecules, polymers, and chemical\nreactions, as well as multi-modal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral\nretrieval. Our results demonstrate that CRAG-MoWs achieve performance\ncomparable to GPT-4o while being preferred more frequently in comparative\nevaluations, highlighting the advantage of structured retrieval and multi-agent\nsynthesis. By revealing performance variations across data types, CRAG-MoW\nprovides a scalable, interpretable, and benchmark-driven approach to optimizing\nAI architectures for materials discovery.

We introduce gRNAde, a\ngeometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences\nthat explicitly account for structure and dynamics. gRNAde uses a multi-state\nGraph Neural Network and autoregressive decoding to generates candidate RNA\nsequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the\nidentities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design\nbenchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. (2010),\ngRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared\nto Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared\nto the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde\non a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as\nwell as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective\nanalysis of a recent ribozyme. Experimental wet lab validation on 10 different\nstructured RNA backbones finds that gRNAde has a success rate of 50% at\ndesigning pseudoknotted RNA structures, a significant advance over 35% for\nRosetta.

    "summary": "We present an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively\nstructures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph\nconstruction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our\napproach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually\nupdated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new\nconcepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates\nsubsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this\nfeedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network\ncharacterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link\ndisparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges\ncontinue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest\npath distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our\nanalysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub'\nconcepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic,\nself-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge\nstructures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional\nreasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles\nto foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that\ntranscend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for\nopen-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific\ndiscovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and\ninterpretability.",

Of particular interest are emerging materials that display\nexceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in\nenergy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian\napproach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging\ncomputational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the\nrational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of\nfirst-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose\nchallenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover,\nthe combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and\noften disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we\nreview a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates\ndata-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and\naccelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials\ndesign framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide\nan example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator\ntransition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with\npractical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify\nmultiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for\ntheir synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in\ndata-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and\nproperty-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked\nissues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing\nmethods to mitigate the gaps.",

While traditional\nforward design methods are constrained by their inability to explore the vast\ncombinatorial design space, inverse design offers a compelling alternative by\ndirectly generating structures that fulfill predefined performance criteria.\nHowever, achieving precise control over both geometry and material properties\nremains a significant challenge due to their intricate interdependence.\nExisting approaches, which typically rely on voxel or parametric\nrepresentations, often limit design flexibility and structural diversity. In\nthis work, we present a novel generative model that integrates latent diffusion\nwith Holoplane, an advanced hybrid neural representation that simultaneously\nencodes both geometric and physical properties. This combination ensures\nsuperior alignment between geometry and properties. Our approach generalizes\nacross multiple microstructure classes, enabling the generation of diverse,\ntileable microstructures with significantly improved property accuracy and\nenhanced control over geometric validity, surpassing the performance of\nexisting methods. We introduce a multi-class dataset encompassing a variety of\ngeometric morphologies, including truss, shell, tube, and plate structures, to\ntrain and validate our model. Experimental results demonstrate the model's\nability to generate microstructures that meet target properties, maintain\ngeometric validity, and integrate seamlessly into complex assemblies.\nAdditionally, we explore the potential of our framework through the generation\nof new microstructures, cross-class interpolation, and the infilling of\nheterogeneous microstructures.

    "summary": "The inherent flexibility of two dimensional materials allows for efficient\nmanipulation of their physical properties through strain application, which is\nessential for the development of advanced nanoscale devices. This study aimed\nto understand the impact of mechanical strain on the magnetic properties of two\ndimensional materials using Monte Carlo simulations.

The key\nparameters analyzed include the Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution\nfunction, and magnetization in relation to temperature and magnetic field. The\nresults indicate that applying biaxial tensile strain generally reduces the\ncritical temperature. In contrast, the biaxial compressive strain increased Tc\nwithin the elastic range, but decreased at higher strain levels. Both\ncompressive and tensile strains significantly influence the ferromagnetic\nproperties and structural ordering, as evidenced by magnetization hysteresis.\nNotably, pure shear strain did not induce disorder, leaving the magnetization\nunaffected.

    "summary": "Additively manufactured (AM) aluminum alloys with high strength and thermal\nstability have broad applications in turbine engines, vacuum pumps, heat\nexchangers, and many other industrial systems. Employing precipitates with an\nL1$_2$ structure to block dislocation motions is a widespread strategy to\nstrengthen aluminum. However, to achieve high strength, a high volume fraction\nof small precipitates is required, and these characteristics are generally\nmutually exclusive. Here, we show that for certain compositions of Al alloys,\nL1$_2$ phases initially precipitate as sub-micron metastable ternary phases\nunder the rapid solidification conditions of powder bed AM, yet the subsequent\nL1$_2$ phases that precipitate during heat treatment of the sample remain at\nthe nanoscale, imparting high strength. For strength to be retained at elevated\ntemperature, these nanoprecipitates must have low coarsening rates. To\ninversely design the composition of an alloy to have these target\nmicrostructural features, we used hybrid calculation of phase diagram\n(CALPHAD)-based integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and\nBayesian optimization techniques. We tested our approach by designing an\nAl-Er-Zr-Y-Yb-Ni model alloy, and the selected composition was manufactured in\npowder form as AM feedstock. The strength of specimens manufactured via laser\npowder bed fusion (LPBF) from the designed composition is comparable to that of\nwrought Al 7075, yet without cracking that occurs upon LPBF of Al 7075. After\nhigh-temperature (400$^\\circ$C) aging the designed alloy is 50% stronger than\nthe strongest known benchmark printable Al alloy.",

    "summary": "Metals have high electronic conductivities, but very low Seebeck\ncoefficients, which traditionally make them unsuitable for thermoelectric\nmaterials. Recent studies, however, showed that metals can deliver ultra-high\nthermoelectric power factors (PFs) under certain conditions. In this work, we\ntheoretically examine the electronic structure and electronic transport\nspecifications which allow for such high PFs. Using Boltzmann transport (BTE)\nsimulations and a multi-band electronic structure model, we show that metals\nwith: i) high degree of transport asymmetry between their bands, ii) strong\ninter-band scattering, and iii) a large degree of band overlap, can provide\nultra-high power factors. We show that each of these characteristics adds to\nthe steepness of the transport distribution function of the BTE, which allows\nfor an increase of the Seebeck coefficient to sizable values, simultaneously\nwith an increase in the electrical conductivity. This work generalizes the\nconcept that transport asymmetry (i.e., mixture of energy regions of high and\nlow contributions to the electrical conductivity), through a combination of\ndifferent band masses, scattering strengths, or energy filtering scenarios,\netc., can indeed result in very high thermoelectric power factors, even in the\nabsence of a material bandgap. Under certain conditions, transport asymmetry\ncan over-compensate any performance degradation to the PF due to bipolar\nconduction and the naturally low Seebeck coefficients that otherwise exist in\nthis class of materials.",

    "summary": "The design of fusion devices is typically based on computationally expensive\nsimulations. This can be alleviated using high aspect ratio models that employ\na reduced number of free parameters, especially in the case of stellarator\noptimization where non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with a large parameter\nspace are optimized to satisfy certain performance criteria. However,\noptimization is still required to find configurations with properties such as\nlow elongation, high rotational transform, finite plasma beta, and good fast\nparticle confinement. In this work, we train a machine learning model to\nconstruct configurations with favorable confinement properties by finding a\nsolution to the inverse design problem, that is, obtaining a set of model input\nparameters for given desired properties. Since the solution of the inverse\nproblem is non-unique, a probabilistic approach, based on mixture density\nnetworks, is used. It is shown that optimized configurations can be generated\nreliably using this method.",

    "summary": "The pursuit of automated scientific discovery has fueled progress from\nsymbolic logic to modern AI, forging new frontiers in reasoning and pattern\nrecognition. Transformers function as potential systems, where every possible\nrelationship remains latent potentiality until tasks impose constraints, akin\nto measurement. Yet, refining their sampling requires more than probabilistic\nselection: solutions must conform to specific structures or rules, ensuring\nconsistency and the invocation of general principles. We present\nGraph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for\nExploratory Optimization of Reasoning), a framework that combines graph\nreasoning with symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge.\nInspired by reinforcement learning, Graph-PReFLexOR defines reasoning as a\nstructured mapping, where tasks yield knowledge graphs, abstract patterns, and\nultimately, final answers. Inspired by category theory, it encodes concepts as\nnodes and their relationships as edges, supporting hierarchical inference and\nadaptive learning through isomorphic representations. Demonstrations include\nhypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning, such as\ndiscovering relationships between mythological concepts like 'thin places' with\nmaterials science. We propose a 'knowledge garden growth' strategy that\nintegrates insights across domains, promoting interdisciplinary connections.\nResults with a 3-billion-parameter Graph-PReFLexOR model show superior\nreasoning depth and adaptability, underscoring the potential for transparent,\nmultidisciplinary AI-driven discovery. It lays the groundwork for general\nautonomous reasoning solutions.",

The algorithm leverages the latent space of a generative model for\nrapid sampling and employs a Pearson correlated surrogate model to predict the\nfigure of merit of the true design metric. As a showcase example, PearSAN is\napplied to thermophotovoltaic (TPV) metasurface design by matching the working\nbands between a thermal radiator and a photovoltaic cell. PearSAN can work with\nany pretrained generative model with a discretized latent space, making it easy\nto integrate with VQ-VAEs and binary autoencoders. Its novel Pearson\ncorrelational loss can be used as both a latent regularization method, similar\nto batch and layer normalization, and as a surrogate training loss. We compare\nboth to previous energy matching losses, which are shown to enforce poor\nregularization and performance, even with upgraded affine parameters. PearSAN\nachieves a state-of-the-art maximum design efficiency of 97%, and is at least\nan order of magnitude faster than previous methods, with an improved maximum\nfigure-of-merit gain.",

    "summary": "Generative model for 2D materials has shown significant promise in\naccelerating the material discovery process. The stability and performance of\nthese materials are strongly influenced by their underlying symmetry. However,\nexisting generative models for 2D materials often neglect symmetry constraints,\nwhich limits both the diversity and quality of the generated structures. Here,\nwe introduce a symmetry-constrained diffusion model (SCDM) that integrates\nspace group symmetry into the generative process. By incorporating Wyckoff\npositions, the model ensures adherence to symmetry principles, leading to the\ngeneration of 2,000 candidate structures. DFT calculations were conducted to\nevaluate the convex hull energies of these structures after structural\nrelaxation. From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy\nstability criteria (Ehull < 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six\ncandidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band\nstructure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which\nexhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a\nsymmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure\nprediction model. The results highlight that incorporating symmetry constraints\nenhances the effectiveness of generated 2D materials, making a contribution to\nthe discovery of 2D materials through generative modeling.",

    "summary": "Environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) enables direct\nobservation of nanoscale chemical processes crucial for catalysis and materials\ndesign. However, the high-energy electron probe can dramatically alter reaction\npathways through radiolysis - the dissociation of molecules under electron beam\nirradiation. While extensively studied in liquid-cell TEM, the impact of\nradiolysis in gas-phase reactions remains unexplored. Here, we present a\nnumerical model elucidating radiation chemistry in both gas and liquid E-TEM\nenvironments. Our findings reveal that while gas-phase E-TEM generates\nradiolytic species with lower reactivity than liquid-phase systems, these\nspecies can accumulate to reaction-altering concentrations, particularly at\nelevated pressures. We validate our model through two case studies: the\nradiation-promoted oxidation of aluminum nanocubes and disproportionation of\ncarbon monoxide. In both cases, increasing the electron beam dose rate directly\naccelerates their reaction kinetics, as demonstrated by enhanced AlOx growth\nand carbon deposition. Based on these insights, we establish practical\nguidelines for controlling radiolysis in closed-cell nanoreactors. This work\nnot only resolves a fundamental challenge in electron microscopy but also\nadvances our ability to rationally design materials with sub-Angstrom\nresolution.",

    "summary": "As microstructure property models improve, additional information from\ncrystallographic degrees of freedom and grain boundary networks (GBNs) can be\nincluded in microstructure design problems. However, the high dimensional\nnature of including this information precludes the use of many common\noptimization approaches and requires less efficient methods to generate quality\ndesigns. Previous work demonstrated that human-in-the-loop optimization,\ninstantiated as a video game, achieved high-quality, efficient solutions to\nthese design problems. However, such data is expensive to obtain. In the\npresent work, we show how a Decision Transformer machine learning (ML) model\ncan be used to learn from the optimization trajectories generated by human\nplayers, and subsequently solve materials design problems. We compare the ML\noptimization trajectories against players and a common global optimization\nalgorithm: simulated annealing (SA). We find that the ML model exhibits a\nvalidation accuracy of 84% against player decisions, and achieves solutions of\ncomparable quality to SA (92%), but does so using three orders of magnitude\nfewer iterations. We find that the ML model generalizes in important and\nsurprising ways, including the ability to train using a simple constitutive\nstructure-property model and then solve microstructure design problems for a\ndifferent, higher-fidelity, constitutive structure-property model without any\nretraining. These results demonstrate the potential of Decision Transformer\nmodels for the solution of materials design problems.",

This study introduces a multiscale topological\nlearning (MTL) framework, integrating algebraic topology and unsupervised\nlearning to tackle these challenges efficiently. By modeling lithium-only and\nlithium-free substructures, the framework extracts multiscale topological\nfeatures and introduces two topological screening metrics-cycle density and\nminimum connectivity distance-to ensure structural connectivity and ion\ndiffusion compatibility. Promising candidates are clustered via unsupervised\nalgorithms to identify those resembling known superionic conductors. For final\nrefinement, candidates that pass chemical screening undergo ab initio molecular\ndynamics simulations for validation. This approach led to the discovery of 14\nnovel LSICs, four of which have been independently validated in recent\nexperiments. This success accelerates the identification of LSICs and\ndemonstrates broad adaptability, offering a scalable tool for addressing\ncomplex materials discovery challenges.",

While early work has shown that\nML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low\naccuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As\nmulti-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the\nunderlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by\nthe accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use\ndifferent strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for\nbuilding highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse\nsources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling\nstrategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which\nalready by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through\nexperiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits,\nwe show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to\nthe good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the\nscalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level\norganic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of\nquality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal\ndataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization\nunder distribution shift.

    "summary": "Designing fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) with a tailored\nnonlinear stress-strain response can enable innovative applications across\nvarious industries. Currently, no efforts have achieved the inverse design of\nFRPCs that target the entire stress-strain curve. Here, we develop\nPC3D_Diffusion, a 3D spatial diffusion model designed for the inverse design of\nFRPCs. We generate 1.35 million FRPCs and calculate their stress-strain curves\nfor training. Although the vanilla PC3D_Diffusion can generate visually\nappealing results, less than 10% of FRPCs generated by the vanilla model are\ncollision-free, in which fibers do not intersect with each other. We then\npropose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to apply physical constraints\nduring generation. As a result, PC3D_Diffusion can generate high-quality\ndesigns with tailored mechanical behaviors while guaranteeing to satisfy the\nphysical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may\nfacilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential\napplications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical\nproperties.",

However, the limited data available about precise\nvalues of these properties have been a barrier, leading to predictive models\nwith limited precision or the ability to generalize. This is particularly true\nof lattice thermal conductivity (LTC): existing datasets of precise (ab initio,\nDFT-based) computed values are limited to a few dozen materials with little\nvariability. Based on such datasets, we study the impact of transfer learning\non both the precision and generalizability of a deep learning model\n(ParAIsite). We start from an existing model (MEGNet~\\cite{Chen2019}) and show\nthat improvements are obtained by fine-tuning a pre-trained version on\ndifferent tasks. Interestingly, we also show that a much greater improvement is\nobtained when first fine-tuning it on a large datasets of low-quality\napproximations of LTC (based on the AGL model) and then applying a second phase\nof fine-tuning with our high-quality, smaller-scale datasets.

While traditional CALPHAD\nmethods are robust, they are resource-intensive and limited by experimentally\nassessed data. This work explores the use of machine learning interatomic\npotentials (MLIPs) such as M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, and ORB to\nsignificantly accelerate phase diagram calculations by using the Alloy\nTheoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) to map calculations of the energies and free\nenergies of atomistic systems to CALPHAD-compatible thermodynamic descriptions.\nUsing case studies including Cr-Mo, Cu-Au, and Pt-W, we demonstrate that MLIPs,\nparticularly ORB, achieve computational speedups exceeding three orders of\nmagnitude compared to DFT while maintaining phase stability predictions within\nacceptable accuracy. Extending this approach to liquid phases and ternary\nsystems like Cr-Mo-V highlights its versatility for high-entropy alloys and\ncomplex chemical spaces. This work demonstrates that MLIPs, integrated with\ntools like ATAT within a CALPHAD framework, provide an efficient and accurate\nframework for high-throughput thermodynamic modeling, enabling rapid\nexploration of novel alloy systems.

In this study, we demonstrate\na significant speedup in an optimization task by reusing a published simulation\nworkflow available for online simulations and its associated data repository,\nwhere the results of each workflow run are automatically stored. Both the\nworkflow and its data follow FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and\nreusable) principles using nanoHUB's infrastructure. The workflow employs\nmolecular dynamics to calculate the melting temperature of multi-principal\ncomponent alloys. We leveraged all prior data not only to develop an accurate\nmachine learning model to start the sequential optimization but also to\noptimize the simulation parameters and accelerate convergence. Prior work\nshowed that finding the alloy composition with the highest melting temperature\nrequired testing 15 alloy compositions, and establishing the melting\ntemperature for each composition took, on average, 4 simulations. By developing\na workflow that utilizes the FAIR data in the nanoHUB database, we reduced the\nnumber of simulations per composition to one and found the alloy with the\nlowest melting temperature testing only three compositions.

Because these molecules have not been discovered, they naturally lie in\nunexplored or scarcely supported regions of the distribution of known\nmolecules. However, prior evaluation methods for implicit graph generative\nmodels have focused on validating statistics computed from the thick support\n(e.g., mean and variance of a graph property). Therefore, there is a mismatch\nbetween the goal of generating novel graphs and the evaluation methods. To\naddress this evaluation gap, we design a novel evaluation method called\nVertical Validation (VV) that systematically creates thin support regions\nduring the train-test splitting procedure and then reweights generated samples\nso that they can be compared to the held-out test data. This procedure can be\nseen as a generalization of the standard train-test procedure except that the\nsplits are dependent on sample features. We demonstrate that our method can be\nused to perform model selection if performance on thin support regions is the\ndesired goal. As a side benefit, we also show that our approach can better\ndetect overfitting as exemplified by memorization.",

    "summary": "Recent progress of deep generative models in the vision and language domain\nhas stimulated significant interest in more structured data generation such as\nmolecules. However, beyond generating new random molecules, efficient\nexploration and a comprehensive understanding of the vast chemical space are of\ngreat importance to molecular science and applications in drug design and\nmaterials discovery. In this paper, we propose a new framework, ChemFlow, to\ntraverse chemical space through navigating the latent space learned by molecule\ngenerative models through flows. We introduce a dynamical system perspective\nthat formulates the problem as learning a vector field that transports the mass\nof the molecular distribution to the region with desired molecular properties\nor structure diversity. Under this framework, we unify previous approaches on\nmolecule latent space traversal and optimization and propose alternative\ncompeting methods incorporating different physical priors. We validate the\nefficacy of ChemFlow on molecule manipulation and single- and multi-objective\nmolecule optimization tasks under both supervised and unsupervised molecular\ndiscovery settings.

    "summary": "For a very long time, computational approaches to the design of new materials\nhave relied on an iterative process of finding a candidate material and\nmodeling its properties. AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping\nto accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and\nstructures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven\napproaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the\nprocess of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches\nto the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse\nproblem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without\nutilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1)\nconditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an\narbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most\nenergetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2)\nconditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that\nincludes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types,\nchemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss\nfunction was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of\ncrystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching,\nusual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches.\nAs a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare\ntarget structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our\nmodifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy\n41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency,\ninference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new\nstructures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.",

Here we demonstrate a robust\nmulti-pump light wave protocol capable of generating both pure spin and valley\ncurrents on femtosecond times. The generation time is determined by the 2d\nmaterial gap, with the creation of pure spin current in WSe2 at 40 fs and pure\nvalley current in bilayer graphene at ~200 fs. Our all-optical approach demands\nno special material design, requiring only a gapped valley active material, and\nis thus applicable to a wide range of 2d materials.",

    "summary": "The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice\nstructures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional\natomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building\nblocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and\nstrength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$.\nMonolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and\nfullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and\nlarge surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic\nband gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band\nedges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the\nacidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption\nenabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively,\nwhile the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can\nseparate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally,\nthe number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more\nthan that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing\nspontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction.

    "summary": "Under some initial and boundary conditions, the rapid reaction-thermal\ndiffusion process taking place during frontal polymerization (FP) destabilizes\nthe planar mode of front propagation, leading to spatially varying, complex\nhierarchical patterns in thermoset polymeric materials. Although modern\nreaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP,\nthe inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that\nproduce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and\nnon-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In\nthis work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate\nconditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of\nhierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes\nboth the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design\nspace. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters is\nsignificantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter training\ntime while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images,\nthe trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions that\nproduce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.",

    "summary": "Metamaterials with functional responses can exhibit varying properties under\ndifferent conditions (e.g., wave-based responses or deformation-induced\nproperty variation). This work addresses the rapid inverse design of such\nmetamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due\nto its intractability and non-unique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and\nnon-interpretable deep-learning-based methods, we propose the\nRandom-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), a\nsingle-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterial designs\nwith on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a\nrandom forest-based \"design$\\rightarrow$response\" forward model, eliminating\nthe need for a more complex \"response$\\rightarrow$design\" inverse model. Based\non the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random\nforest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain\nMonte Carlo methods. We validate RIGID on acoustic and optical metamaterial\ndesign problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the\ngenetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates\nsatisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing\nfor better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target\nsatisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse\ndesign problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable\nmachine learning into generative design under small data constraints.",

FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base\ndistribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting\nto a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and\niteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation\nrate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for\nstable, unique, and novel crystals by $\\sim50\\%$ - a huge improvement on a\ndifficult problem.

This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry,\npotentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional\nmaterials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of\nSLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and\ngeneration have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and\nrobustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES.\nFurthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we\nhave demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical\nproperties and crystal systems with precision.

Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly\nused, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical\nobjectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA\ntasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into\nthe evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single-\nand multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses\ntraditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during\ntheir extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs\nutilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming\nthose focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies\neight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200\ncandidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using\nnatural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into\nmulti-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for\nintricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new\nligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and\nexternal chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization\nand molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained\nfoundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee\nbroad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and\nmaterials design.",

    "summary": "Conway's Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class\nof cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme\nsensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate\nbehavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology\npresents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that\ncan generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We\ndevelop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to solve\nthis problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with\nno prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions\n(LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and\nour results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic\nrules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given\nsufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an\n`autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our\nresults pave the path towards true universal computation within a large\nlanguage model framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural\nlanguage processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the\nevolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs\ncould potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by\nextracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create\nnew predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields\nof bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.",

Generative models,\nparticularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offer a promising approach\nfor metasurface inverse design by efficiently navigating complex design spaces\nand capturing underlying data patterns. However, existing generative models\nstruggle to achieve high electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity.\nThese challenges arise from the lack of explicit electromagnetic constraints\nduring training, which hinders accurate structure-to-electromagnetic response\nmapping, and the absence of mechanisms to handle one-to-many mappings dilemma,\nresulting in insufficient structural diversity. To address these issues, we\npropose the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), a novel\nframework that improves both electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity.\nTo achieve high electromagnetic fidelity, AcGAN proposes the Spectral Overlap\nCoefficient (SOC) for precise spectral fidelity assessment and develops\nAnchorNet, which provides real-time feedback on electromagnetic performance to\nrefine the structure-to-electromagnetic mapping. To enhance structural\ndiversity, AcGAN incorporates a cluster-guided controller that refines input\nprocessing and ensures multi-level spectral integration, guiding the generation\nprocess to explore multiple configurations for the same spectral target.\nAdditionally, a dynamic loss function progressively shifts the focus from\ndata-driven learning to optimizing both spectral fidelity and structural\ndiversity. Empirical analysis shows that AcGAN reduces the Mean Squared Error\n(MSE) by 73% compared to current state-of-the-art GANs methods and\nsignificantly expands the design space to generate diverse metasurface\narchitectures that meet precise spectral demands.",

As such, we describe key materials science information\nextraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale,\nmulti-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge.\nFinally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world\nmaterials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated\nIn-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials\nLaboratories.",

    "summary": "Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning\nworkhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields\nsuch as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures.\nMulticomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can\nexhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a\nvariety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to\nfully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability,\nstrength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on\norderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure\nGCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the\nordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we\nbenchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the\nordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made\ndataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional\nsymmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference\nbetween the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same\nmaterial, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently\npreserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various\norderings.",

Their flexible and comparatively simple structure allows for\nfacile chemical substitution and cube-on-cube combination of different\ncompounds in atomically sharp epitaxial heterostructures. However, already in\nthe bulk, the diverse physical properties of perovskites and their anisotropy\nare determined by small deviations from the ideal perovskite structure, which\nare difficult to control. Here we show that directional imprinting of atomic\ndisplacements in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator YVO$_3$ is achieved by\ndepositing epitaxial films on different facets of an isostructural substrate.\nThese facets were chosen such that other control parameters, including strain\nand polarity mismatch with the overlayer, remain unchanged. We use polarized\nRaman scattering and spectral ellipsometry to detect signatures of staggered\norbital and magnetic order, and demonstrate distinct spin-orbital ordering\npatterns on different facets. These observations can be attributed to the\ninfluence of specific octahedral rotation and cation displacement patterns,\nwhich are imprinted by the substrate facet, on the covalency of the bonds and\nthe superexchange interactions in YVO$_3$. Well beyond established\nstrain-engineering strategies, our results show that substrate-induced\ntemplating of lattice distortion patterns constitutes a powerful pathway for\nmaterials design.",

    "summary": "Interconversion between charge and spin currents is a key phenomenon in\nrealizing next-generation spintronic devices. Highly efficient spin-charge\ninterconversion is expected to occur at band crossing points in materials with\nlarge spin-orbit interactions due to enhanced spin Berry curvature. On the\nother hand, if defects and/or impurities are present, they affect the\nelectronic band structure, which in turn reduces the spin Berry curvature.\nAlthough defects and impurities are generally numerous in materials, their\ninfluence on the spin Berry curvature and, consequently, spin-charge\ninterconversion has often been overlooked. In this paper, we perform\nspin-pumping experiments for stoichiometric SrRuO3 and non-stoichiometric\nSrRu0.7O3 films at 300 K, where the films are in paramagnetic states, to\nexamine how Ru composition deviation from the stoichiometric condition\ninfluences the spin-to-charge conversion, showing that SrRuO3 has a larger spin\nHall angle than SrRu0.7O3. We derive the band structures of paramagnetic SrRuO3\nand SrRu0.75O3 using first-principles calculations, indicating that the spin\nHall conductivity originating from the spin Berry curvature decreases when the\nRu deficiency is incorporated, which agrees with the experimental results. Our\nresults suggest that point-defect- and impurity control is essential to fully\nexploit the intrinsic spin Berry curvature and large spin-charge\ninterconversion function of materials. These insights help us with material\ndesigns for efficient spin-charge interconversions.",

Due to the presence\nof chemical order and disorder in these systems, neither experimental efforts\nnor ab-initio computational methods alone are sufficient to span the inherently\nlarge configuration space. Therefore, fast and accurate models are necessary.\nTo this end, cluster expansions have been widely and successfully used for the\npast decades. Cluster expansions are generalized Ising models designed to\npredict the energy of any atomic configuration of a system after training on a\nsmall subset of the available configurations. Constructing and sampling a\ncluster expansion consists of multiple steps that have to be performed with\ncare. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive guide to this process,\nhighlighting important considerations and potential pitfalls. The tutorial\nconsists of three parts, starting with cluster expansion construction for a\nrelatively simple system, continuing with strategies for more challenging\nsystems such as surfaces and closing with examples of Monte Carlo sampling of\ncluster expansions to study order-disorder transitions and phase diagrams.",

    "summary": "Molecular dynamics simulations are a crucial computational tool for\nresearchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in\nareas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite\ntheir utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality\nof molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality\n(iMD-VR) has recently been developed as a 'human-in-the-loop' strategy, which\nleverages high-performance computing to accelerate the researcher's ability to\nsolve the hyperdimensional sampling problem. By providing an immersive 3D\nenvironment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular\nmotion, iMD-VR enables researchers and students to efficiently and intuitively\nexplore and navigate these complex, high-dimensional systems. iMD-VR platforms\noffer a unique opportunity to quickly generate rich datasets that capture human\nexperts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper\nexplores the possibility of employing user-generated iMD-VR datasets to train\nAI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL is an important technique in robotics\nthat enables agents to mimic complex behaviors from expert demonstrations, thus\ncircumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. We\nreview the utilization of IL for manipulation tasks in robotics and discuss how\niMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models for solving specific\nmolecular 'tasks'. We then investigate how such approaches could be applied to\nthe data captured from iMD-VR recordings. Finally, we outline the future\nresearch directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment\nhuman expertise to efficiently navigate conformational spaces, highlighting how\nthis approach could provide valuable insight across domains such as materials\nscience, protein engineering, and computer-aided drug design.",

This work demonstrates that large\nlanguage models (LLMs), coupled with prompt engineering, can effectively\ngenerate non-trivial materials hypotheses by integrating scientific principles\nfrom diverse sources without explicit design guidance by human experts. These\ninclude design ideas for high-entropy alloys with superior cryogenic properties\nand halide solid electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity and formability.\nThese design ideas have been experimentally validated in high-impact\npublications in 2023 not available in the LLM training data, demonstrating the\nLLM's ability to generate highly valuable and realizable innovative ideas not\nestablished in the literature. Our approach primarily leverages materials\nsystem charts encoding processing-structure-property relationships, enabling\nmore effective data integration by condensing key information from numerous\npapers, and evaluation and categorization of numerous hypotheses for human\ncognition, both through the LLM. This LLM-driven approach opens the door to new\navenues of artificial intelligence-driven materials discovery by accelerating\ndesign, democratizing innovation, and expanding capabilities beyond the\ndesigner's direct knowledge.",

    "summary": "Vitrimer is a new, exciting class of sustainable polymers with the ability to\nheal due to their dynamic covalent adaptive network that can go through\nassociative rearrangement reactions. However, a limited choice of constituent\nmolecules restricts their property space, prohibiting full realization of their\npotential applications. To overcome this challenge, we couple molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations and a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE)\nmachine learning model for inverse design of vitrimer chemistries with desired\nglass transition temperature (Tg) and synthesize a novel vitrimer polymer. We\nbuild the first vitrimer dataset of one million chemistries and calculate Tg on\n8,424 of them by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian\nprocess model. The proposed novel VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent\ndimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of\nmulti-component vitrimers. By constructing a continuous latent space containing\nnecessary information of vitrimers, we demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency\nof our framework in discovering novel vitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the\ntraining regime. To validate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments,\nwe generate novel vitrimer chemistries with a target Tg = 323 K. By\nincorporating chemical intuition, we synthesize a vitrimer with Tg of 311-317\nK, and experimentally demonstrate healability and flowability. The proposed\nframework offers an exciting tool for polymer chemists to design and synthesize\nnovel, sustainable vitrimer polymers for a facet of applications.",

    "summary": "The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in\nfields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of\nfine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical\ncapabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining\n(CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization\napproaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio\nPreference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis\nshows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the\nmerging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities\nthat surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that\nmodel merging leads to new functionalities that neither parent model could\nachieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments.\nExperiments with different model architectures are presented, including Llama\n3.1 8B and Mistral 7B models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring\nwhether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with\n1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature\nemergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be\na key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a\nhuman and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how\ndifferent model variants perform and show that the smallest model achieves a\nhigh intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth,\ncreativity, clarity, and quantitative precision.

However, the recent discovery of millions of new crystals and\ncomplex twisted structures has challenged traditional computational methods,\nboth ab initio and machine-learning-based, due to their computationally\nintensive iterative processes. To address these scalability issues, here we\nintroduce DeepRelax, a deep generative model capable of performing geometric\ncrystal structure relaxation rapidly and without iterations. DeepRelax learns\nthe equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it to predict relaxed\nstructures directly from their unrelaxed ones. The ability to perform\nstructural relaxation at the millisecond level per structure, combined with the\nscalability of parallel processing, makes DeepRelax particularly useful for\nlarge-scale virtual screening. We demonstrate DeepRelax's reliability and\nrobustness by applying it to five diverse databases, including oxides,\nMaterials Project, two-dimensional materials, van der Waals crystals, and\ncrystals with point defects. DeepRelax consistently shows high accuracy and\nefficiency, validated by density functional theory calculations. Finally, we\nenhance its trustworthiness by integrating uncertainty quantification.

    "summary": "In the last decades, the capacity to generate large amounts of data in\nscience and engineering applications has been growing steadily. Meanwhile,\nmachine learning has progressed to become a suitable tool to process and\nutilise the available data. Nonetheless, many relevant scientific and\nengineering problems present challenges where current machine learning methods\ncannot yet efficiently leverage the available data and resources. For example,\nin scientific discovery, we are often faced with the problem of exploring very\nlarge, structured and high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, the high fidelity,\nblack-box objective function is often very expensive to evaluate. Progress in\nmachine learning methods that can efficiently tackle such challenges would help\naccelerate currently crucial areas such as drug and materials discovery. In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-fidelity active learning algorithm with\nGFlowNets as a sampler, to efficiently discover diverse, high-scoring\ncandidates where multiple approximations of the black-box function are\navailable at lower fidelity and cost. Our evaluation on molecular discovery\ntasks shows that multi-fidelity active learning with GFlowNets can discover\nhigh-scoring candidates at a fraction of the budget of its single-fidelity\ncounterpart while maintaining diversity, unlike RL-based alternatives. These\nresults open new avenues for multi-fidelity active learning to accelerate\nscientific discovery and engineering design.",

While periodic homogenization of auxetic\nunit cells can be used to investigate these properties, it is computationally\nexpensive and limits design space exploration and inverse analysis. In this\npaper, surrogate models are developed for the real-time prediction of the\neffective elastic properties of auxetic unit cells with orthogonal voids of\ndifferent shapes. The unit cells feature orthogonal voids in four distinct\nshapes, including rectangular, diamond, oval, and peanut-shaped voids, each\ncharacterized by specific void diameters. The generated surrogate models accept\ngeometric parameters and the elastic properties of the base material as inputs\nto predict the effective elastic constants in real-time. This rapid evaluation\nenables a practical inverse analysis framework for obtaining the optimal design\nparameters that yield the desired effective response. The fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT)-based homogenization approach is adopted to efficiently\ngenerate data for developing the surrogate models, bypassing concerns about\nperiodic mesh generation and boundary conditions typically associated with the\nfinite element method (FEM). The performance of the generated surrogate models\nis rigorously examined through a train/test split methodology, a parametric\nstudy, and an inverse problem.

    "summary": "Adjoint-based design optimizations are usually computationally expensive and\nthose costs scale with resolution. To address this, researchers have proposed\nmachine learning approaches for inverse design that can predict\nhigher-resolution solutions from lower cost/resolution ones. Due to the recent\nsuccess of diffusion models over traditional generative models, we extend the\nuse of diffusion models for multi-resolution tasks by proposing the conditional\ncascaded diffusion model (cCDM). Compared to GANs, cCDM is more stable to\ntrain, and each diffusion model within the cCDM can be trained independently,\nthus each model's parameters can be tuned separately to maximize the\nperformance of the pipeline. Our study compares cCDM against a cGAN model with\ntransfer learning.\n  Our results demonstrate that the cCDM excels in capturing finer details,\npreserving volume fraction constraints, and minimizing compliance errors in\nmulti-resolution tasks when a sufficient amount of high-resolution training\ndata (more than 102 designs) is available. Furthermore, we explore the impact\nof training data size on the performance of both models. While both models show\ndecreased performance with reduced high-resolution training data, the cCDM\nloses its superiority to the cGAN model with transfer learning when training\ndata is limited (less than 102), and we show the break-even point for this\ntransition. Also, we highlight that while the diffusion model may achieve\nbetter pixel-wise performance in both low-resolution and high-resolution\nscenarios, this does not necessarily guarantee that the model produces optimal\ncompliance error or constraint satisfaction.",

Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution\nover the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty\nin an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does\nnot require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable\nto any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the\nAS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the\nmodel diversity under epistemic uncertainty.",

    "summary": "Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties represents a\nformidable challenge in materials science. Although recent generative models\nhave demonstrated potential, their adoption has been hindered by limitations\nsuch as inefficiency, architectural constraints and restricted open-source\navailability. The representation of crystal structures using the SLICES\n(Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) notation as a string of\ncharacters enables the use of state-of-the-art natural language processing\nmodels, such as Transformers, for crystal design. Drawing inspiration from the\nsuccess of GPT models in generating coherent text, we trained a generative\nTransformer on the next-token prediction task to generate solid-state materials\nwith targeted properties. We demonstrate MatterGPT's capability to generate de\nnovo crystal structures with targeted single properties, including both\nlattice-insensitive (formation energy) and lattice-sensitive (band gap)\nproperties. Furthermore, we extend MatterGPT to simultaneously target multiple\nproperties, addressing the complex challenge of multi-objective inverse design\nof crystals. Our approach showcases high validity, uniqueness, and novelty in\ngenerated structures, as well as the ability to generate materials with\nproperties beyond the training data distribution.

However, effectively generating high-quality periodic structures\nof materials on limited but diverse datasets remains an ongoing challenge. Here\nwe propose a novel approach for periodic structure generation which fully\nrespect the intrinsic symmetries, periodicity, and invariances of the structure\nspace. Namely, we utilize differentiable, physics-based, structural descriptors\nwhich can describe periodic systems and satisfy the necessary invariances, in\nconjunction with a denoising diffusion model which generates new materials\nwithin this descriptor or representation space. Reconstruction is then\nperformed on these representations using gradient-based optimization to recover\nthe corresponding Cartesian positions of the crystal structure. This approach\ndiffers significantly from current methods by generating materials in the\nrepresentation space, rather than in the Cartesian space, which is made\npossible using an efficient reconstruction algorithm. Consequently, known\nissues with respecting periodic boundaries and translational and rotational\ninvariances during generation can be avoided, and the model training process\ncan be greatly simplified. We show this approach is able to provide competitive\nperformance on established benchmarks compared to current state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "summary": "Ventilated acoustic resonator(VAR), a type of acoustic metamaterial, emerge\nas an alternative for sound attenuation in environments that require\nventilation, owing to its excellent low-frequency attenuation performance and\nflexible shape adaptability. However, due to the non-linear acoustic responses\nof VARs, the VAR designs are generally obtained within a limited parametrized\ndesign space, and the design relies on the iteration of the numerical\nsimulation which consumes a considerable amount of computational time and\nresources. This paper proposes an acoustic response-encoded variational\nautoencoder (AR-VAE), a novel variational autoencoder-based generative design\nmodel for the efficient and accurate inverse design of VAR even with\nnon-parametrized designs. The AR-VAE matches the high-dimensional acoustic\nresponse with the VAR cross-section image in the dimension-reduced latent\nspace, which enables the AR-VAE to generate various non-parametrized VAR\ncross-section images with the target acoustic response. AR-VAE generates\nnon-parameterized VARs from target acoustic responses, which show a 25-fold\nreduction in mean squared error compared to conventional deep learning-based\nparameter searching methods while exhibiting lower average mean squared error\nand peak frequency variance. By combining the inverse-designed VARs by AR-VAE,\nmulti-cavity VAR was devised for broadband and multitarget peak frequency\nattenuation. The proposed design method presents a new approach for structural\ninverse-design with a high-dimensional non-linear physical response.",

In the materials\ndiscovery framework, it is often necessary to virtually screen a large and\nhigh-dimensional chemical space to find materials with desired properties.\nHowever, grid searching a large chemical space with DFT is inefficient due to\nits high computational cost. We propose an approach utilizing Bayesian\noptimization (BO) with an artificial neural network kernel to enable smart\nsearch. This method leverages the BO algorithm, where the neural network,\ntrained on a limited number of DFT results, determines the most promising\nregions of the chemical space to explore in subsequent iterations. This\napproach aims to discover materials with target properties while minimizing the\nnumber of DFT calculations required. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nmethod, we investigated 63 doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with sizes\nranging from 1 to 2 nm to find the structure with the highest light absorbance.\nUsing time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) only 12 times, we achieved a significant\nreduction in computational cost, approximately 20% of what would be required\nfor a full grid search, by employing the BO algorithm with a neural network\nkernel. Considering that TDDFT calculations for a single GQD require about half\na day of wall time on high-performance computing nodes, this reduction is\nsubstantial.

    "summary": "Inverse material design is a cornerstone challenge in materials science, with\nsignificant applications across many industries. Traditional approaches that\ninvert the structure-property (SP) linkage to identify microstructures with\ntargeted properties often overlook the feasibility of production processes,\nleading to microstructures that may not be manufacturable. Achieving both\ndesired properties and a realizable manufacturing procedure necessitates\ninverting the entire Process-Structure-Property (PSP) chain. However, this task\nis fraught with challenges, including stochasticity along the whole modeling\nchain, the high dimensionality of microstructures and process parameters, and\nthe inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem. This paper proposes a novel\nframework, named PSP-GEN, for the goal-oriented material design that\neffectively addresses these challenges by modeling the entire PSP chain with a\ndeep generative model. It employs two sets of continuous, microstructure- and\nproperty-aware, latent variables, the first of which provides a\nlower-dimensional representation that captures the stochastic aspects of\nmicrostructure generation, while the second is a direct link to processing\nparameters. This structured, low-dimensional embedding not only simplifies the\nhandling of high-dimensional microstructure data but also facilitates the\napplication of gradient-based optimization techniques. The effectiveness and\nefficiency of this method are demonstrated in the inverse design of two-phase\nmaterials, where the objective is to design microstructures with target\neffective permeability. We compare state-of-the-art alternatives in challenging\nsettings involving limited training data, target property regions for which no\ntraining data is available, and design tasks where the process parameters and\nmicrostructures have high-dimensional representations.",

In this study, a simple yet\npowerful fragment-based descriptor, Low Dimensional Fragment Descriptors\n(LDFD), is proposed to work in conjunction with machine learning models to\npredict important properties of a wide range of inorganic materials such as\nperovskite oxides, metal halide perovskites, alloys, semiconductor, and other\nmaterials system and can also be extended to work with interfaces. To predict\nproperties, the generation of descriptors requires only the structural formula\nof the materials and, in presence of identical structure in the dataset,\nadditional system properties as input. And the generation of descriptors\ninvolves few steps, encoding the formula in binary space and reduction of\ndimensionality, allowing easy implementation and prediction. To evaluate\ndescriptor performance, six known datasets with up to eight components were\ncompared. The method was applied to properties such as band gaps of perovskites\nand semiconductors, lattice constant of magnetic alloys, bulk/shear modulus of\nsuperhard alloys, critical temperature of superconductors, formation enthalpy\nand energy above hull convex of perovskite oxides. An advanced python-based\ndata mining tool matminer was utilized for the collection of data. The\nprediction accuracies are equivalent to the quality of the training data and\nshow comparable effectiveness as previous studies. This method should be\nextendable to any inorganic material systems which can be subdivided into\nlayers or crystal structures with more than one atom site, and with the\nprogress of data mining the performance should get better with larger and\nunbiased datasets.",

TAD creates a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown\nmapping at each iterative stage, proposing a new batch of control settings to\nsample experimentally and optimizing the updated log-predictive likelihood of\nthe target design. TAD either stops upon locating a solution with uncertainties\nthat fit inside the tolerance box or uses a measure of expected future\ninformation to determine that the search space has been exhausted with no\nsolution. TAD thus embodies the exploration-exploitation tension in a manner\nthat recalls, but is essentially different from, Bayesian optimization and\noptimal experimental design.",

    "summary": "Discovery of novel and promising materials is a critical challenge in the\nfield of chemistry and material science, traditionally approached through\nmethodologies ranging from trial-and-error to machine learning-driven inverse\ndesign. Recent studies suggest that transformer-based language models can be\nutilized as material generative models to expand chemical space and explore\nmaterials with desired properties. In this work, we introduce the Catalyst\nGenerative Pretrained Transformer (CatGPT), trained to generate string\nrepresentations of inorganic catalyst structures from a vast chemical space.\nCatGPT not only demonstrates high performance in generating valid and accurate\ncatalyst structures but also serves as a foundation model for generating\ndesired types of catalysts by fine-tuning with sparse and specified datasets.\nAs an example, we fine-tuned the pretrained CatGPT using a binary alloy\ncatalyst dataset designed for screening two-electron oxygen reduction reaction\n(2e-ORR) catalyst and generate catalyst structures specialized for 2e-ORR. Our\nwork demonstrates the potential of language models as generative tools for\ncatalyst discovery.",

We extend existing\nnumerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying\ngeometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we\ninvestigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN,\nand U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem:\n(1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3)\napproximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their\nspeed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an\nablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the\ndroplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our\nextensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced\nvarying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the\npreviously considered oil expulsion problem.",

    "summary": "Generative models have received significant attention in recent years for\nmaterials science applications, particularly in the area of inverse design for\nmaterials discovery. However, these models are usually assessed based on newly\ngenerated, unverified materials, which provide a narrow evaluation of a model's\nperformance. Also, current efforts for inorganic materials have predominantly\nfocused on small crystals, even though the capability to generate large\ndisordered structures would significantly expand the applicability of\ngenerative modeling. In this work, we present the Disordered Materials &\nInterfaces Benchmark (Dismai-Bench), a generative model benchmark that uses\ndatasets of disordered alloys, interfaces, and amorphous silicon (256-264 atoms\nper structure). Models are trained on each dataset independently, and evaluated\nthrough direct structural comparisons between training and generated\nstructures. Benchmarking was performed on two graph diffusion models and two\n(coordinate-based) U-Net diffusion models. The graph models were found to\nsignificantly outperform the U-Net models due to the higher expressive power of\ngraphs. While noise in the less expressive models can assist in discovering\nmaterials by facilitating exploration beyond the training distribution, these\nmodels face significant challenges when confronted with more complex\nstructures. To further demonstrate the benefits of this benchmarking in the\ndevelopment process of a generative model, we considered the case of developing\na point-cloud-based generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate low-energy\ndisordered interfaces. We show that the best performing architecture, CryinGAN,\noutperforms the U-Net models, and is competitive against the graph models\ndespite its lack of invariances and weaker expressive power. This work provides\na new framework and insights to guide the development of future generative\nmodels.",

    "summary": "The design of alloys is a multi-scale problem that requires a holistic\napproach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced\ncomputational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the\nresults, a process that is typically reserved for human experts. Machine\nlearning (ML) can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use\nof deep surrogate models that connect structural features to material\nproperties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target\nspecific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate\nout-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here,\nwe overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of\nmultiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment\nto solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative\nAI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models\n(LLM) the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various\ndomains, including knowledge retrieval, multi-modal data integration,\nphysics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities\nthat includes numerical data and images of physical simulation results. The\nconcerted effort of the multi-agent system allows for addressing complex\nmaterials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include\nautonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to\ntheir pure counterparts.

    "summary": "Two-photon polymerization (2PP) 3D printing is a well-known technique for\nfabricating passive micro/nanoscale structures, such as microlenses and\ninversely designed polarization splitters. The integration of light emitting\nnanoparticle (NP) dopants, such as quantum dots (QDs) and rare-earth doped\nnanoparticles (RENPs), into a polymer resist would enable 3D printing of active\npolymer micro-photonic devices, including sensors, lasers, and solid-state\ndisplays. Many NPs are stabilized with oleic acid ligands to prevent\ndegradation, but oleate-capped NPs (oc-NPs) tend to agglomerate in nonpolar\nmedia despite the hydrophobicity of the ligand. This results in an uneven\ndistribution of NPs in polymers and increased optical extinction properties. In\nthis work, we propose a general approach for dispersing various oc-NPs in\ncommercial 3D printable polymers. We achieve controlled growth of small carbon\nchains around the oc-NPs by functionalizing the NPs with methyl-methacrylate\nmonomers. The proposed approach is validated on RENPs (~65 nm) and CdSe/ZnS\nquantum dots (~12 nm) using different commercial polymer resists (IP-Dip and\nIP-Visio). Dispersions of functionalized NPs (f-NPs) have improved NP density\nby an order of magnitude and are shown to be stable for several weeks with\nminimal impact on printing quality. Our approach is generalizable to a variety\nof oc-NPs and ultimately leads to higher quality polymer-based optical and\nelectronic devices.",

    "summary": "The inverse design of tailored organic molecules for specific optoelectronic\ndevices of high complexity holds an enormous potential, but has not yet been\nrealized1,2. The complexity and literally infinite diversity of conjugated\nmolecular structures present both, an unprecedented opportunity for\ntechnological breakthroughs as well as an unseen optimization challenge.\nCurrent models rely on big data which do not exist for specialized research\nfilms. However, a hybrid computational and high throughput experimental\nscreening workflow allowed us to train predictive models with as little as 149\nmolecules. We demonstrate a unique closed-loop workflow combining high\nthroughput synthesis and Bayesian optimization that discovers new hole\ntransporting materials with tailored properties for solar cell applications. A\nseries of high-performance molecules were identified from minimal suggestions,\nachieving up to 26.23% (certified 25.88%) power conversion efficiency in\nperovskite solar cells. Our work paves the way for rapid, informed discovery in\nvast molecular libraries, revolutionizing material selection for complex\ndevices. We believe that our approach can be generalized to other emerging\nfields and indeed accelerate the development of optoelectronic semiconductor\ndevices in general.",

Nevertheless, there are hardly any predictions\nand/or syntheses that incorporate only transition metals into new ternary\nnitrides. Here, we report on the synthesis, structure, and properties of\nMnCoN$_2$, a new ternary nitride material comprising only transition metals and\nN. We find that crystalline MnCoN$_2$ can be stabilized over its competing\nbinaries, and over a tendency of this system to become amorphous, by\ncontrolling growth temperature within a narrow window slightly above ambient\ncondition. We find that single-phase MnCoN$_2$ thin films form in a\ncation-disordered rocksalt crystal structure, which is supported by ab-initio\ncalculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that MnCoN$_2$\nis sensitive to oxygen through various oxides and hydroxides binding to cobalt\non the surface. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to verify that Mn$^{3+}$\nand Co$^{3+}$ cations exist in an octahedrally-coordinated environment, which\nis distinct from a combination of CoN and MnN binaries and in agreement with\nthe rocksalt-based crystal structure prediction. Magnetic measurements suggest\nthat MnCoN$_2$ has a canted antiferromagnetic ground state below 10 K. We\nextract a Weiss temperature of $\\theta$ = -49.7 K, highlighting the\nantiferromagnetic correlations in MnCoN$_2$.",

    "summary": "Overcoming the challenge of limited data availability within materials\nscience is crucial for the broad-based applicability of machine learning within\nmaterials science. One pathway to overcome this limited data availability is to\nuse the framework of transfer learning (TL), where a pre-trained (PT) machine\nlearning model (on a larger dataset) can be fine-tuned (FT) on a target\n(typically smaller) dataset. Our study systematically explores the\neffectiveness of various PT/FT strategies to learn and predict material\nproperties with limited data. Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks\n(GNNs) to PT/FT on seven diverse curated materials datasets, encompassing sizes\nranging from 941 to 132,752 datapoints. We consider datasets that cover a\nspectrum of material properties, ranging from band gaps (electronic) to\nformation energies (thermodynamic) and shear moduli (mechanical). We study the\ninfluence of PT and FT dataset sizes, strategies that can be employed for FT,\nand other hyperparameters on pair-wise TL among the datasets considered. We\nfind our pair-wise PT-FT models to consistently outperform models trained from\nscratch on the target datasets. Importantly, we develop a GNN framework that is\nsimultaneously PT on multiple properties (MPT), enabling the construction of\ngeneralized GNN models. Our MPT models outperform pair-wise PT-FT models on\nseveral datasets considered, and more significantly, on a 2D material band gap\ndataset that is completely out-of-distribution from the PT datasets. Finally,\nwe expect our PT/FT and MPT frameworks to be generalizable to other GNNs and\nmaterials properties, which can accelerate materials design and discovery for\nvarious applications.",

While these models have demonstrated exceptional performance in\ngenerating novel and plausible data, it remains an open question whether they\ncan effectively accelerate scientific discovery through the data generation and\ndrive significant advancements across various scientific fields. In particular,\nthe discovery of new inorganic materials with promising properties poses a\ncritical challenge, both scientifically and for industrial applications.\nHowever, unlike textual or image data, materials, or more specifically crystal\nstructures, consist of multiple types of variables - including lattice vectors,\natom positions, and atomic species. This complexity in data give rise to a\nvariety of approaches for representing and generating such data. Consequently,\nthe design choices of generative models for crystal structures remain an open\nquestion. In this study, we explore a new type of diffusion model for the\ngenerative inverse design of crystal structures, with a backbone based on a\nTransformer architecture. We demonstrate our models are superior to previous\nmethods in their versatility for generating crystal structures with desired\nproperties.

    "summary": "Aqueous batteries play an increasingly important role for the development of\nsustainable and safety-prioritised energy storage solutions. Compared to\nconventional lithium-ion batteries, the cell chemistry in aqueous batteries\nshare many common features with those of electrolyzer and pseudo-capacitor\nsystems because of the involvement of aqueous electrolyte and proton activity.\nThis imposes the needs for a better understanding of the corresponding ion\nsolvation, intercalation and electron transfer processes at atomistic scale.\nTherefore, this chapter provides an up-to-date overview of molecular modelling\ntechniques and their applications in aqueous batteries. In particular, we\nemphasize on the dynamical and reactive description of aqueous battery systems\nbrought in by density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulation\n(DFTMD) and its machine-learning (ML) accelerated counterpart. Moreover, we\nalso cover the recent advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in\nmolecular and materials design of aqueous batteries. Case studies presented\nhere include popular aqueous battery systems, such as water-in-salt\nelectrolytes, proton-coupled cathode materials, Zn-ion batteries as well as\norganic redox flow batteries.",

    "summary": "Molecule inverse folding has been a long-standing challenge in chemistry and\nbiology, with the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and material\nscience. Despite specified models have been proposed for different small- or\nmacro-molecules, few have attempted to unify the learning process, resulting in\nredundant efforts. Complementary to recent advancements in molecular structure\nprediction, such as RoseTTAFold All-Atom and AlphaFold3, we propose the unified\nmodel UniIF for the inverse folding of all molecules. We do such unification in\ntwo levels: 1) Data-Level: We propose a unified block graph data form for all\nmolecules, including the local frame building and geometric feature\ninitialization. 2) Model-Level: We introduce a geometric block attention\nnetwork, comprising a geometric interaction, interactive attention and virtual\nlong-term dependency modules, to capture the 3D interactions of all molecules.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations across various tasks such as protein design,\nRNA design, and material design, we demonstrate that our proposed method\nsurpasses state-of-the-art methods on all tasks. UniIF offers a versatile and\neffective solution for general molecule inverse folding.",

One of the fundamental challenges lies\nin how to overcome the limitation of traditional generative models to\nefficiently explore the global chemical space rather than a small localized\nspace. Herein, we develop a framework named MAGECS to address this dilemma, by\nintegrating the bird swarm algorithm and supervised graph neural network to\neffectively navigate the generative model in the immense chemical space towards\nmaterials with target properties. As a demonstration, MAGECS is applied to\ndesign compelling alloy electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction reaction\n(CO$_2$RR) and works extremely well. Specifically, the chemical space of\nCO$_2$RR is effectively explored, where over 250,000 promising structures with\nhigh activity have been generated and notably, the proportion of desired\nstructures is 2.5-fold increased. Moreover, five predicted alloys, i.e., CuAl,\nAlPd, Sn$_2$Pd$_5$, Sn$_9$Pd$_7$, and CuAlSe$_2$ are successfully synthesized\nand characterized experimentally, two of which exhibit about 90% Faraday\nefficiency of CO$_2$RR, and CuAl achieved 76% efficiency for C$_2$ products.\nThis pioneering application of inverse design in CO$_2$RR catalysis showcases\nthe potential of MAGECS to dramatically accelerate the development of\nfunctional materials, paving the way for fully automated, artificial\nintelligence-driven material design.",

A routine is detailed for\nconverting the chemical structure of a free monomer to the urethane bonded\nrepeat units in a polymer. The python package RadonPy is leveraged to assemble\nthese units into blocks, and the blocks into copolymers. Care is taken in this\nwork to ensure that plausible atomic charges are assigned to repeat units in\ndifferent parts of the chain. The static structure factor is calculated for a\nvariety of chemistries, and the results compared with wide angle x-ray\nscattering data from experiments with corresponding composition. The generated\nmodels reproduce the amorphous halo observed in the scattering data as well as\nsome of the finer details. Structure factor calculations are decomposed into\nthe partial structure factors to interrogate the structural properties of the\ntwo block types separately. Parametric surveys are carried out of the effects\nof various parameters, including temperature, soft block length, and block\nconnectivity on the observed structure. The routine detailed here for\nconstructing models is robust enough to be executed automatically in a high\nthroughput workflow for material design and discovery.",

    "summary": "In materials science, the challenge of rapid prototyping materials with\ndesired properties often involves extensive experimentation to find suitable\nmicrostructures. Additionally, finding microstructures for given properties is\ntypically an ill-posed problem where multiple solutions may exist. Using\ngenerative machine learning models can be a viable solution which also reduces\nthe computational cost. This comes with new challenges because, e.g., a\ncontinuous property variable as conditioning input to the model is required. We\ninvestigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel\nembedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary\nrepresentation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for\nnormalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space\nfor conditioning the generative model. This technique can be applied to\ncondition a network on any number, to provide fine control over generated\nmicrostructure images, thereby contributing to accelerated materials design.",

Herein, we develop reinforcement\nlearning-guided combinatorial chemistry, which is a rule-based molecular\ndesigner driven by trained policy for selecting subsequent molecular fragments\nto get a target molecule. Since our model has the potential to generate all\npossible molecular structures that can be obtained from combinations of\nmolecular fragments, unknown molecules with superior properties can be\ndiscovered. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that our model is more\nsuitable for discovering better compounds than probability\ndistribution-learning models. In an experiment aimed at discovering molecules\nthat hit seven extreme target properties, our model discovered 1,315 of all\ntarget-hitting molecules and 7,629 of five target-hitting molecules out of\n100,000 trials, whereas the probability distribution-learning models failed.\nMoreover, it has been confirmed that every molecule generated under the binding\nrules of molecular fragments is 100% chemically valid. To illustrate the\nperformance in actual problems, we also demonstrate that our models work well\non two practical applications: discovering protein docking molecules and HIV\ninhibitors.",

One fundamental challenge of these\nsystems is their ability to represent nonlinear relationships between sets of\ndata that have different dimensionalities. Existing design methods often\nimplement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network in order to solve this\nproblem, but in many cases the solution is unable to generate structures that\nprovide multiple peaks when validated.

Among them, the Fourier neural operator (FNO)\nachieves good accuracy, and is significantly faster compared to numerical\nsolvers, on a variety of PDEs, such as fluid flows. However, the FNO uses the\nFast Fourier transform (FFT), which is limited to rectangular domains with\nuniform grids. In this work, we propose a new framework, viz., geo-FNO, to\nsolve PDEs on arbitrary geometries. Geo-FNO learns to deform the input\n(physical) domain, which may be irregular, into a latent space with a uniform\ngrid. The FNO model with the FFT is applied in the latent space. The resulting\ngeo-FNO model has both the computation efficiency of FFT and the flexibility of\nhandling arbitrary geometries. Our geo-FNO is also flexible in terms of its\ninput formats, viz., point clouds, meshes, and design parameters are all valid\ninputs. We consider a variety of PDEs such as the Elasticity, Plasticity,\nEuler's, and Navier-Stokes equations, and both forward modeling and inverse\ndesign problems. Geo-FNO is $10^5$ times faster than the standard numerical\nsolvers and twice more accurate compared to direct interpolation on existing\nML-based PDE solvers such as the standard FNO.",

We use our model to produce a variety of visually compelling noise\ntextures.

    "summary": "As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular\nstructures that lead to outstanding mechanical properties, like high\nstiffness-to-weight ratios and good energy absorption. To reproduce these\nproperties in synthetic materials, biomimicry typically replicates the\nirregular natural structure, often leading to fabrication challenges. Here, we\npresent a bioinspired material design method that instead reduces the irregular\nnatural structure to a finite set of building blocks, also known as tiles, and\nrules to connect them, and then uses these elements as instructions to generate\nsynthetic materials with mechanical properties similar to the biological\nmaterials. We demonstrate the method using the pericarp of the orange, a member\nof the citrus family known for its protective, energy-absorbing capabilities.\nWe generate polymer samples and characterize them under quasi-static and\ndynamic compression and observe spatially-varying stiffness and good energy\nabsorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and\nconnectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, we determine how to\nspatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.",

In applications such as materials\ndesign, deep-sea and planetary robot exploration and medicine, however, there\ncan be a high cost associated with measuring, or even approximating, the state\nof the environment. In this paper, we survey the recently growing literature\nthat adopts the perspective that an RL agent might not need, or even want, a\ncostly measurement at each time step. Within this context, we propose the Deep\nDynamic Multi-Step Observationless Agent (DMSOA), contrast it with the\nliterature and empirically evaluate it on OpenAI gym and Atari Pong\nenvironments.

While representing quantum states with tensor networks and neural\nnetworks are the two state-of-the-art methods for approximate simulations, each\nhas its own limitations in terms of expressivity and inductive bias. To address\nthese challenges, we develop a novel architecture, Autoregressive Neural\nTensorNet (ANTN), which bridges tensor networks and autoregressive neural\nnetworks. We show that Autoregressive Neural TensorNet parameterizes normalized\nwavefunctions, allows for exact sampling, generalizes the expressivity of\ntensor networks and autoregressive neural networks, and inherits a variety of\nsymmetries from autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate our approach on\nquantum state learning as well as finding the ground state of the challenging\n2D $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model with different systems sizes and coupling\nparameters, outperforming both tensor networks and autoregressive neural\nnetworks.

The practical application of such devices is built upon\ncrystalline materials whose longitudinal NCT occurs at room temperature and\nunder low magnetic field. However, materials of this type are rather rare and\nelusive, and theory guiding the discovery of these materials is lacking. Here,\nwe develop such a theory within the framework of semiclassical Boltzmann\ntransport theory.

The\nsymmetry-adapted Hamiltonian analysis further uncovers a previously overlooked\nmechanism for this phenomenon. Our theory guides the first-principles\nprediction of longitudinal NCT in multiferroic \\epsilon-Fe2O3 semiconductor\nthat possibly occurs at room temperature, without the application of external\nmagnetic field.

Addressing these hurdles, this study\nintroduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian\nmatrices obtained from first-principles DFT calculations of nearly all crystal\nstructures on the Materials Project. We demonstrate its generality in\npredicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including\ncomplex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\\'e twisted\nbilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we\nutilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of\nelectronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940\ncrystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering\na reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this\nuniversal Hamiltonian model lays the groundwork for advancements in diverse\nfields, such as easily providing a huge data set of electronic structures and\nalso making the materials design across the whole periodic table possible.",

Granular metamaterials are one such substrate\nthat has emerged as a promising platform for building wave-based information\nprocessing devices with the potential to integrate sensing, actuation, and\ncomputation. Their high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics result in nontrivial\nand sometimes counter-intuitive wave responses that can be shaped by the\nmaterial properties, geometry, and configuration of individual grains. Such\nhighly tunable rich dynamics can be utilized for mechanical computing in\nspecial-purpose applications. However, there are currently no general\nframeworks for the inverse design of large-scale granular materials. Here, we\nbuild upon the similarity between the spatiotemporal dynamics of wave\npropagation in material and the computational dynamics of Recurrent Neural\nNetworks to develop a gradient-based optimization framework for harmonically\ndriven granular crystals. We showcase how our framework can be utilized to\ndesign basic logic gates where mechanical vibrations carry the information at\npredetermined frequencies. We compare our design methodology with classic\ngradient-free methods and find that our approach discovers higher-performing\nconfigurations with less computational effort.

Our findings suggest that ML\nmodels can generalize from cost-effective calculations of simpler systems to\nmore complex scenarios.

To\naddress this explicitly, we introduce a generative design framework (WyCryst),\ncomposed of three pivotal components: 1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic\ncrystal representation, 2) a property-directed VAE model and 3) an automated\nDFT workflow for structure refinement. Our model selectively generates\nmaterials that follow the ground truth of unit cell space group symmetry by\nencoding the Wyckoff representation for each space group. We successfully\nreproduce a variety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and\n221), CsPbI3 (SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both\nground state as well as polymorphic structure predictions. We also generate\nseveral new ternary materials not found in the inorganic materials database\n(Materials Project), which are proved to be stable, retaining their symmetry,\nand we also check their phonon stability, using our automated DFT workflow\nhighlighting the validity of our approach. We believe our symmetry-aware\nWyCryst takes a vital step towards AI-driven inorganic materials discovery.",

    "summary": "This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs)\nand irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role\nof dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research\ndelineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies,\ninfluence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision\ncascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show\na marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly\nmodulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is\nshown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect\nproduction, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB\ncharacteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the\ninvestigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a\ncrucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB\nconfigurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For\ninstance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry\ncan significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point\nto the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced\nradiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By\ntailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials\ncan be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage,\noffering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other\nradiation-prone environments.",

    "summary": "Molecular conformation optimization is crucial to computer-aided drug\ndiscovery and materials design. Traditional energy minimization techniques rely\non iterative optimization methods that use molecular forces calculated by a\nphysical simulator (oracle) as anti-gradients. However, this is a\ncomputationally expensive approach that requires many interactions with a\nphysical simulator. One way to accelerate this procedure is to replace the\nphysical simulator with a neural network. Despite recent progress in neural\nnetworks for molecular conformation energy prediction, such models are prone to\ndistribution shift, leading to inaccurate energy minimization. We find that the\nquality of energy minimization with neural networks can be improved by\nproviding optimization trajectories as additional training data. Still, it\ntakes around $5 \\times 10^5$ additional conformations to match the physical\nsimulator's optimization quality. In this work, we present the Gradual\nOptimization Learning Framework (GOLF) for energy minimization with neural\nnetworks that significantly reduces the required additional data. The framework\nconsists of an efficient data-collecting scheme and an external optimizer. The\nexternal optimizer utilizes gradients from the energy prediction model to\ngenerate optimization trajectories, and the data-collecting scheme selects\nadditional training data to be processed by the physical simulator. Our results\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with GOLF performs on par with the\noracle on a benchmark of diverse drug-like molecules using $50$x less\nadditional data.",

Inverse design\nis typically formulated as an optimization problem, with recent works\nleveraging optimization across learned dynamics models. However, as models are\noptimized they tend to fall into adversarial modes, preventing effective\nsampling. We illustrate that by instead optimizing over the learned energy\nfunction captured by the diffusion model, we can avoid such adversarial\nexamples and significantly improve design performance. We further illustrate\nhow such a design system is compositional, enabling us to combine multiple\ndifferent diffusion models representing subcomponents of our desired system to\ndesign systems with every specified component. In an N-body interaction task\nand a challenging 2D multi-airfoil design task, we demonstrate that by\ncomposing the learned diffusion model at test time, our method allows us to\ndesign initial states and boundary shapes that are more complex than those in\nthe training data.

This is largely driven by the conceptual and theoretical ease to\nhandle, predict, and understand highly uniform systems that exhibit complex\ninteractions, symmetries and band structures. In this perspective, we highlight\nhow flipping this paradigm has enabled exciting possibilities in the emerging\nfield of high entropy oxide (HEO) quantum materials. These materials host high\nlevels of cation or anion compositional disorder while maintaining unexpectedly\nuniform single crystal lattices. The diversity of atomic scale interactions of\nspin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom are found to emerge into\ncoherent properties on much larger length scales. Thus, altering the variance\nand magnitudes of the atomic scale properties through elemental selection can\nopen new routes to tune global correlated phases such as magnetism,\nmetal-insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and even emergent topological\nresponses. The strategy of embracing disorder in this way provides a much\nbroader pallet from which functional states can be designed for next-generation\nmicroelectronic and quantum information systems.",

The highest reported strength achievable\nthrough the combination of multiple metals (alloying) has rapidly climbed and\ngiven rise to new classifications of materials with extraordinary properties.\nMetallic glasses and high-entropy alloys are two limiting examples of how\ntailored order can be used to manipulate mechanical behavior. Here, we show\nthat the complex electronic-structure mechanisms governing the peak strength of\nalloys and pure metals can be reduced to a few physically-meaningful parameters\nbased on their atomic arrangements and used (with no fitting parameters) to\npredict the maximum strength of any metallic solid, regardless of degree of\nstructural or chemical ordering. Predictions of maximum strength based on the\nactivation energy for a stress-driven phase transition to an amorphous state is\nshown to accurately describe the breakdown in Hall-Petch behavior at the\nsmallest crystallite sizes for pure metals, intermetallic compounds, metallic\nglasses, and high-entropy alloys. This activation energy is also shown to be\ndirectly proportional to interstitial (electronic) charge density, which is a\ngood predictor of ductility, stiffness (moduli), and phase stability in\nhigh-entropy alloys, and in solid metals generally. The proposed framework\nsuggests the possibility of coupling ordering and intrinsic strength to\nmechanisms like dislocation nucleation, hydrogen embrittlement, and transport\nproperties. It additionally opens the prospect for greatly accelerated\nstructural materials design and development to address materials challenges\nlimiting more sustainable and efficient use of energy.",

In this position paper, we consider\nthe potential, challenges, and promising approaches for generative AI for\ndesign on the edge, i.e., in resource-constrained settings where memory,\ncompute, energy (battery) and network connectivity may be limited. Adapting\ngenerative AI for such settings involves overcoming significant hurdles,\nprimarily in how to streamline complex models to function efficiently in\nlow-resource environments. This necessitates innovative approaches in model\ncompression, efficient algorithmic design, and perhaps even leveraging edge\ncomputing. The objective is to harness the power of generative AI in creating\nbespoke solutions for design problems, such as medical interventions, farm\nequipment maintenance, and educational material design, tailored to the unique\nconstraints and needs of remote areas. These efforts could democratize access\nto advanced technology and foster sustainable development, ensuring universal\naccessibility and environmental consideration of AI-driven design benefits.",

    "summary": "Both computational and experimental material discovery bring forth the\nchallenge of exploring multidimensional and often non-differentiable parameter\nspaces, such as phase diagrams of Hamiltonians with multiple interactions,\ncomposition spaces of combinatorial libraries, processing spaces, and molecular\nembedding spaces. Often these systems are expensive or time-consuming to\nevaluate a single instance, and hence classical approaches based on exhaustive\ngrid or random search are too data intensive. This resulted in strong interest\ntowards active learning methods such as Bayesian optimization (BO) where the\nadaptive exploration occurs based on human learning (discovery) objective.\nHowever, classical BO is based on a predefined optimization target, and\npolicies balancing exploration and exploitation are purely data driven. In\npractical settings, the domain expert can pose prior knowledge on the system in\nform of partially known physics laws and often varies exploration policies\nduring the experiment. Here, we explore interactive workflows building on\nmulti-fidelity BO (MFBO), starting with classical (data-driven) MFBO, then\nstructured (physics-driven) sMFBO, and extending it to allow human in the loop\ninteractive iMFBO workflows for adaptive and domain expert aligned exploration.\nThese approaches are demonstrated over highly non-smooth multi-fidelity\nsimulation data generated from an Ising model, considering spin-spin\ninteraction as parameter space, lattice sizes as fidelity spaces, and the\nobjective as maximizing heat capacity. Detailed analysis and comparison show\nthe impact of physics knowledge injection and on-the-fly human decisions for\nimproved exploration, current challenges, and potential opportunities for\nalgorithm development with combining data, physics and real time human\ndecisions.",

    "summary": "Tailoring materials to achieve a desired behavior in specific applications is\nof significant scientific and industrial interest as design of materials is a\nkey driver to innovation. Overcoming the rather slow and expertise-bound\ntraditional forward approaches of trial and error, inverse design is attracting\nsubstantial attention. Targeting a property, the design model proposes a\ncandidate structure with the desired property. This concept can be particularly\nwell applied to the field of architected materials as their structures can be\ndirectly tuned. The bone-like spinodoid materials are a specific class of\narchitected materials. They are of considerable interest thanks to their\nnon-periodicity, smoothness, and low-dimensional statistical description.\nPrevious work successfully employed machine learning (ML) models for inverse\ndesign. The amount of data necessary for most ML approaches poses a severe\nobstacle for broader application, especially in the context of inelasticity.\nThat is why we propose an inverse-design approach based on Bayesian\noptimization to operate in the small-data regime. Necessitating substantially\nless data, a small initial data set is iteratively augmented by in silico\ngenerated data until a structure with the targeted properties is found. The\napplication to the inverse design of spinodoid structures of desired elastic\nproperties demonstrates the framework's potential for paving the way for\nadvance in inverse design.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promotes the polymer design paradigm from a\ntraditional trial-and-error approach to a data-driven style. Achieving high\nthermal conductivity (TC) for intrinsic polymers is urgent because of their\nimportance in the thermal management of many industrial applications such as\nmicroelectronic devices and integrated circuits. In this work, we have proposed\na robust AI-assisted workflow for the inverse design of high TC polymers. By\nusing 1144 polymers with known computational TCs, we construct a surrogate deep\nneural network model for TC prediction and extract a polymer-unit library with\n32 sequences. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms of\nunified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (U-NSGA-III) and q-noisy\nexpected hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI) are employed for sequence-ordered\npolymer design with both high TC and synthetic possibility. For triblock\npolymer design, the result indicates that qNHEVI is capable of exploring a\ndiversity of optimal polymers at the Pareto front, but the uncertainty in\nQuasi-Monte Carlo sampling makes the trials costly. The performance of\nU-NSGA-III is affected by the initial random structures and usually falls into\na locally optimal solution, but it takes fewer attempts with lower costs. 20\nparallel U-NSGA-III runs are conducted to design the pentablock polymers with\nhigh TC, and half of the candidates among 1921 generated polymers achieve the\ntargets (TC > 0.4 W/(mK) and SA < 3.0). Ultimately, we check the TC of 50\npromising polymers through molecular dynamics simulations and reveal the\nintrinsic connections between microstructures and TCs. Our developed\nAI-assisted inverse design approach for polymers is flexible and universal, and\ncan be extended to the design of polymers with other target properties.",

The challenges associated with experimental data management are\nespecially true for combinatorial materials science, where advancements in\nautomation of experimental workflows have produced datasets that are often too\nlarge and too complex for human reasoning. The data management challenge is\nfurther compounded by the multi-modal and multi-institutional nature of these\ndatasets, as they tend to be distributed across multiple institutions and can\nvary substantially in format, size, and content. To adequately map a materials\ndesign space from such datasets, an ideal materials data infrastructure would\ncontain data and metadata describing i) synthesis and processing conditions,\nii) characterization results, and iii) property and performance measurements.\nHere, we present a case study for the low-barrier development of such a\ndashboard that enables standardized organization, analysis, and visualization\nof a large data lake consisting of combinatorial datasets of synthesis and\nprocessing conditions, X-ray diffraction patterns, and materials property\nmeasurements generated at several different institutions. While this dashboard\nwas developed specifically for data-driven thermoelectric materials discovery,\nwe envision the adaptation of this prototype to other materials applications,\nand, more ambitiously, future integration into an all-encompassing materials\ndata management infrastructure.",

However, existing methods for molecule generation focus either on 2D\ngraph structure or on 3D geometric structure, which is not sufficient to\nrepresent a complete molecule as 2D graph captures mainly topology while 3D\ngeometry captures mainly spatial atom arrangements. Combining these\nrepresentations is essential to better represent a molecule. In this paper, we\npresent a new model for generating a comprehensive representation of molecules,\nincluding atom features, 2D discrete molecule structures, and 3D continuous\nmolecule coordinates, by combining discrete and continuous diffusion processes.\nThe use of diffusion processes allows for capturing the probabilistic nature of\nmolecular processes and exploring the effect of different factors on molecular\nstructures. Additionally, we propose a novel graph transformer architecture to\ndenoise the diffusion process. The transformer adheres to 3D roto-translation\nequivariance constraints, allowing it to learn invariant atom and edge\nrepresentations while preserving the equivariance of atom coordinates. This\ntransformer can be used to learn molecular representations robust to geometric\ntransformations. We evaluate the performance of our model through experiments\nand comparisons with existing methods, showing its ability to generate more\nstable and valid molecules. Our model is a promising approach for designing\nstable and diverse molecules and can be applied to a wide range of tasks in\nmolecular modeling.",

An emerging class of corrosion-resistant\nmaterials are high-entropy alloys.

Here we develop a physics-informed machine-learning framework to\nidentify corrosion-resistant high-entropy alloys. Three metrics are used to\nevaluate the corrosion resistance, including single-phase formability, surface\nenergy and Pilling-Bedworth ratios. We used random forest models to predict the\nsingle-phase formability, trained on an experimental dataset. Machine learning\ninter-atomic potentials were employed to calculate surface energies and\nPilling-Bedworth ratios, which are trained on first-principles data fast\nsampled using embedded atom models. A combination of random forest models and\nhigh-fidelity machine learning potentials represents the first of its kind to\nrelate chemical compositions to corrosion resistance of high-entropy alloys,\npaving the way for automatic design of materials with superior corrosion\nprotection. This framework was demonstrated on AlCrFeCoNi high-entropy alloys\nand we identified composition regions with high corrosion resistance. Machine\nlearning predicted lattice constants and surface energies are consistent with\nvalues by first-principles calculations. The predicted single-phase formability\nand corrosion-resistant compositions of AlCrFeCoNi agree well with experiments.\nThis framework is general in its application and applicable to other materials,\nenabling high-throughput screening of material candidates and potentially\nreducing the turnaround time for integrated computational materials\nengineering.",

    "summary": "The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in\ndriving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and\ncarbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design\nby directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property\nconstraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low\nsuccess rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited\nset of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates\nstable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further\nbe fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property\nconstraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative\nprocess that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,\ncoordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to\nenable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled\ndataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen\nare more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times\ncloser to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully\ngenerates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as\nmechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate\nmulti-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have\nboth high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain\nrisk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of\nMatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a\nuniversal generative model for materials design.",

Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged\nas a popular sample-efficient optimization engine, thriving in tasks where no\nanalytic form of the target function/property is known. Here, we exploit expert\nhuman knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches more\nquickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have used\nunderlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, which\nis unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributions\ncannot capture intricate hypotheses. Our proposed method, which we call HypBO,\nuses expert human hypotheses to generate improved seed samples. Unpromising\nseeds are automatically discounted, while promising seeds are used to augment\nthe surrogate model data, thus achieving better-informed sampling. This process\ncontinues in a global versus local search fashion, organized in a bilevel\noptimization framework. We validate the performance of our method on a range of\nsynthetic functions and demonstrate its practical utility on a real chemical\ndesign task where the use of expert hypotheses accelerates the search\nperformance significantly.",

This capability is greatly enabled by the\ngeneralized gradient approximation for exchange-correlation interactions with\nan important set of exchange-correlation functionals developed by John Perdew\nand his collaborators in last several decades. The scientific community and the\npresent author's group have greatly benefited from this capability. Over the\nyears, the present author's group has integrated the energetics from DFT-based\ncalculations both at zero K and finite temperature into thermodynamic modeling\nand developed methods to predict tracer diffusivity, elastic coefficients,\ninterfacial energy, and a number of other properties related to the derivatives\nof free energy. One key outcome is the accurate prediction of free energy of a\nsystem through the consideration of both ground-state and stable\nsymmetry-breaking non-ground-state configurations. It is articulated that\nphonon properties of all individual configurations can be accurately calculated\nby quasiharmonic approximations in the temperature and volume ranges of\ninterest, and the emergent behaviors and anharmonicity of a system originate\nprimarily from the statistical competition among all the configurations.",

    "summary": "Microstructure is key to controlling and understanding the properties of\nmetallic materials, but traditional approaches to describing microstructure\ncapture only a small number of features. To enable data-centric approaches to\nmaterials discovery, allow efficient storage of microstructural data and assist\nin quality control in metals processing, we require more complete descriptors\nof microstructure. The concept of microstructural fingerprinting, using machine\nlearning (ML) to develop quantitative, low-dimensional descriptors of\nmicrostructures, has recently attracted significant attention. However, it is\ndifficult to interpret conclusions drawn by ML algorithms, which are commonly\nreferred to as \"black boxes\".\n  Here we explore variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can be trained to\nproduce microstructural fingerprints in a continuous latent space. VAEs enable\nthe reconstruction of images from fingerprints, allowing us to explore how key\nfeatures of microstructure are encoded. We develop a VAE architecture based on\nResNet18 and train it on Ti-6Al-4V optical micrographs as an example of an\nindustrially important alloy where microstructural control is critical to\nperformance. The latent space is explored in several ways, including by\nsupplying interpolated and randomly perturbed fingerprints to the trained\ndecoder and via dimensionality reduction to explore the distribution of\nmicrostructural features within the latent space of fingerprints. We show that\nthe VAE fingerprints exhibit smooth, interpolable behaviour with stability to\nlocal perturbations, supporting their suitability as general purpose\ndescriptors for microstructure. We also show that key properties of the\nmicrostructures are strongly correlated with position in the latent space,\nsupporting the use of VAE fingerprints for quantitative exploration of\nprocess-structure-property relationships.",

Molecules\ninherently exist in the real world as three-dimensional structures;\nfurthermore, they are not static but in continuous motion in the 3D Euclidean\nspace, forming a potential energy surface. Therefore, it is desirable to\ngenerate multiple conformations in advance and extract molecular\nrepresentations using a 4D-QSAR model that incorporates multiple conformations.\nHowever, this approach is impractical for drug and material discovery tasks\nbecause of the computational cost of obtaining multiple conformations. To\naddress this issue, we propose a pre-training method for molecular GNNs using\nan existing dataset of molecular conformations to generate a latent vector\nuniversal to multiple conformations from a 2D molecular graph. Our method,\ncalled Boltzmann GNN, is formulated by maximizing the conditional marginal\nlikelihood of a conditional generative model for conformations generation.

    "summary": "Sparse regression and feature extraction are the cornerstones of knowledge\ndiscovery from massive data. Their goal is to discover interpretable and\npredictive models that provide simple relationships among scientific variables.\nWhile the statistical tools for model discovery are well established in the\ncontext of linear regression, their generalization to nonlinear regression in\nmaterial modeling is highly problem-specific and insufficiently understood.\nHere we explore the potential of neural networks for automatic model discovery\nand induce sparsity by a hybrid approach that combines two strategies:\nregularization and physical constraints. We integrate the concept of Lp\nregularization for subset selection with constitutive neural networks that\nleverage our domain knowledge in kinematics and thermodynamics. We train our\nnetworks with both, synthetic and real data, and perform several thousand\ndiscovery runs to infer common guidelines and trends: L2 regularization or\nridge regression is unsuitable for model discovery; L1 regularization or lasso\npromotes sparsity, but induces strong bias; only L0 regularization allows us to\ntransparently fine-tune the trade-off between interpretability and\npredictability, simplicity and accuracy, and bias and variance. With these\ninsights, we demonstrate that Lp regularized constitutive neural networks can\nsimultaneously discover both, interpretable models and physically meaningful\nparameters. We anticipate that our findings will generalize to alternative\ndiscovery techniques such as sparse and symbolic regression, and to other\ndomains such as biology, chemistry, or medicine. Our ability to automatically\ndiscover material models from data could have tremendous applications in\ngenerative material design and open new opportunities to manipulate matter,\nalter properties of existing materials, and discover new materials with\nuser-defined properties.",

Their practical utility is determined by two conflicting\nproperties: high dielectric constants tend to occur in materials with narrow\nband gaps, limiting the operating voltage before dielectric breakdown. We\npresent a high-throughput workflow that combines element substitution, ML\npre-screening, ab initio simulation and human expert intuition to efficiently\nexplore the vast space of unknown materials for potential dielectrics, leading\nto the synthesis and characterization of two novel dielectric materials,\nCsTaTeO6 and Bi2Zr2O7. Our key idea is to deploy ML in a multi-objective\noptimization setting with concave Pareto front. While usually considered more\nchallenging than single-objective optimization, we argue and show preliminary\nevidence that the $1/x$-correlation between band gap and permittivity in fact\nmakes the task more amenable to ML methods by allowing separate models for band\ngap and permittivity to each operate in regions of good training support while\nstill predicting materials of exceptional merit. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst instance of successful ML-guided multi-objective materials optimization\nachieving experimental synthesis and characterization. CsTaTeO6 is a structure\ngenerated via element substitution not present in our reference data sources,\nthus exemplifying successful de-novo materials design.

Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a potential paradigm shift by\ndeveloping fast data-driven surrogate models. In particular, an AI framework,\nknown as Neural Operators, presents a principled framework for learning\nmappings between functions defined on continuous domains, e.g., spatiotemporal\nprocesses and partial differential equations (PDE). They can extrapolate and\npredict solutions at new locations unseen during training, i.e., perform\nzero-shot super-resolution. Neural Operators can augment or even replace\nexisting simulators in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics,\nweather forecasting, and material modeling, while being 4-5 orders of magnitude\nfaster. Further, Neural Operators can be integrated with physics and other\ndomain constraints enforced at finer resolutions to obtain high-fidelity\nsolutions and good generalization.

    "summary": "Torquato and Kim [Phys. Rev. X 11, 296 021002 (2021)] derived exact nonlocal\nstrong-contrast expansions of the effective dynamic dielectric constant tensor\nthat treat general three-dimensional (3D) two-phase composites, which are valid\nwell beyond the long-wavelength regime. Here, we demonstrate that truncating\nthis general rapidly converging series at the two- and three-point levels is a\npowerful theoretical tool for extracting accurate approximations suited for\nvarious microstructural symmetries. We derive such closed-form formulas\napplicable to transverse polarization in layered media and transverse magnetic\npolarization in transversely isotropic media, respectively. We use these\nformulas to estimate effective dielectric constant for models of 3D disordered\nhyperuniform layered and transversely isotropic media: nonstealthy hyperuniform\nand stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) media. In particular, we show that SHU media\nare perfectly transparent (trivially implying no Anderson localization, in\nprinciple) within finite wave number intervals through the third-order terms.\nFor these two models, we validate that the second-order formulas, which depend\non the spectral density, are already very accurate well beyond the\nlong-wavelength regime by showing very good agreement with the\nfinite-difference time-domain simulations. The high predictive power of the\nsecond-order formulas implies that higher-order contributions are negligibly\nsmall, and thus, it very accurately approximates multiple scattering effects.\nTherefore, there can be no Anderson localization in practice within the\npredicted perfect transparency interval in SHU media because the localization\nlength should be very large compared to any practically large sample size. Our\npredictive theory provides a foundation for the inverse design of novel\neffective wave characteristics of disordered and statistically anisotropic\nstructures.",

Yet, no generic physical model to realize such FBs has\nbeen developed. Here we present a new mathematical theorem, called bipartite\ndouble cover (BDC) theorem, and prove that the BDC of line-graph (LG) lattices\nhosts at least two chiral exact FBs of opposite chirality, i.e., yin-yang FBs,\ncentered-around/at charge neutrality (E = 0) akin to the \"chiral limit\" of\ntwisted bilayer graphene. We illustrate this theorem by mapping it exactly onto\ntight-binding lattice models of the BDC of LGs of hexagonal lattice for strong\ntopological and of triangular lattice for fragile topological FBs,\nrespectively. Moreover, we use orbital design principle to realize such exotic\nyin-yang FBs in non-BDC lattices to instigate their real material discovery.\nThis work not only enables the search for exact chiral FBs at zero energy\nbeyond moir\\'e heterostructures, but also opens the door to discovering quantum\nsemiconductor features with FB-enabled strongly correlated carriers.",

The dataset is tabular\nin form and is preprocessed to include sixty-one generalized input features\nthat broadly describes the physicochemical, stability/geometrical, and Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) target properties associated with the elemental ionic\nsites in a three-dimensional ABX3 polyhedral. For validation, four different ML\nmodels are employed to predict three distinctive target properties, namely:\nformation energy, energy band gap, and crystal system. On experimentation, the\nbest accuracy measurements are reported at 0.013 eV/atom MAE, 0.216 eV MAE, and\n85% F1, corresponding to the formation energy prediction, band gap prediction\nand crystal system multi-classification, respectively.

Discovering new solid-state materials such as\nelectrocatalysts, super-ionic conductors or photovoltaic materials can have a\ncrucial impact, for instance, in improving the efficiency of renewable energy\nproduction and storage. In this paper, we introduce Crystal-GFN, a generative\nmodel of crystal structures that sequentially samples structural properties of\ncrystalline materials, namely the space group, composition and lattice\nparameters. This domain-inspired approach enables the flexible incorporation of\nphysical and structural hard constraints, as well as the use of any available\npredictive model of a desired physicochemical property as an objective\nfunction. To design stable materials, one must target the candidates with the\nlowest formation energy. Here, we use as objective the formation energy per\natom of a crystal structure predicted by a new proxy machine learning model\ntrained on MatBench. The results demonstrate that Crystal-GFN is able to sample\nhighly diverse crystals with low (median -3.1 eV/atom) predicted formation\nenergy.",

    "summary": "Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) has significantly\nenhanced the systemic analysis of the relationship between microstructure and\nmaterial properties, paving the way for the development of high-performance\nmaterials. However, analyzing microstructure-sensitive material behavior\nremains challenging due to the scarcity of three-dimensional (3D)\nmicrostructure datasets. Moreover, this challenge is amplified if the\nmicrostructure is anisotropic, as this results in anisotropic material\nproperties as well. In this paper, we present a framework for reconstruction of\nanisotropic microstructures solely based on two-dimensional (2D) micrographs\nusing conditional diffusion-based generative models (DGMs). The proposed\nframework involves spatial connection of multiple 2D conditional DGMs, each\ntrained to generate 2D microstructure samples for three different orthogonal\nplanes. The connected multiple reverse diffusion processes then enable\neffective modeling of a Markov chain for transforming noise into a 3D\nmicrostructure sample. Furthermore, a modified harmonized sampling is employed\nto enhance the sample quality while preserving the spatial connection between\nthe slices of anisotropic microstructure samples in 3D space. To validate the\nproposed framework, the 2D-to-3D reconstructed anisotropic microstructure\nsamples are evaluated in terms of both the spatial correlation function and the\nphysical material behavior. The results demonstrate that the framework is\ncapable of reproducing not only the statistical distribution of material phases\nbut also the material properties in 3D space. This highlights the potential\napplication of the proposed 2D-to-3D reconstruction framework in establishing\nmicrostructure-property linkages, which could aid high-throughput material\ndesign for future studies",

The generative model samples\nplausible sequences while the discriminative model guides a search for\nsequences with high fitness. Given its broad success in conditional sampling,\nclassifier-guided diffusion modeling is a promising foundation for protein\ndesign, leading many to develop guided diffusion models for structure with\ninverse folding to recover sequences. In this work, we propose diffusioN\nOptimized Sampling (NOS), a guidance method for discrete diffusion models that\nfollows gradients in the hidden states of the denoising network. NOS makes it\npossible to perform design directly in sequence space, circumventing\nsignificant limitations of structure-based methods, including scarce data and\nchallenging inverse design. Moreover, we use NOS to generalize LaMBO, a\nBayesian optimization procedure for sequence design that facilitates multiple\nobjectives and edit-based constraints. The resulting method, LaMBO-2, enables\ndiscrete diffusions and stronger performance with limited edits through a novel\napplication of saliency maps. We apply LaMBO-2 to a real-world protein design\ntask, optimizing antibodies for higher expression yield and binding affinity to\nseveral therapeutic targets under locality and developability constraints,\nattaining a 99% expression rate and 40% binding rate in exploratory in vitro\nexperiments.",

    "summary": "Sampling the phase space of molecular systems -- and, more generally, of\ncomplex systems effectively modeled by stochastic differential equations -- is\na crucial modeling step in many fields, from protein folding to materials\ndiscovery. These problems are often multiscale in nature: they can be described\nin terms of low-dimensional effective free energy surfaces parametrized by a\nsmall number of \"slow\" reaction coordinates; the remaining \"fast\" degrees of\nfreedom populate an equilibrium measure on the reaction coordinate values.\nSampling procedures for such problems are used to estimate effective free\nenergy differences as well as ensemble averages with respect to the conditional\nequilibrium distributions; these latter averages lead to closures for effective\nreduced dynamic models. Over the years, enhanced sampling techniques coupled\nwith molecular simulation have been developed. An intriguing analogy arises\nwith the field of Machine Learning (ML), where Generative Adversarial Networks\ncan produce high dimensional samples from low dimensional probability\ndistributions. This sample generation returns plausible high dimensional space\nrealizations of a model state, from information about its low-dimensional\nrepresentation. In this work, we present an approach that couples physics-based\nsimulations and biasing methods for sampling conditional distributions with\nML-based conditional generative adversarial networks for the same task. The\n\"coarse descriptors\" on which we condition the fine scale realizations can\neither be known a priori, or learned through nonlinear dimensionality\nreduction. We suggest that this may bring out the best features of both\napproaches: we demonstrate that a framework that couples cGANs with\nphysics-based enhanced sampling techniques can improve multiscale SDE dynamical\nsystems sampling, and even shows promise for systems of increasing complexity.",

For demonstration, we apply the model to identify the atomic\nstructures of amorphous carbons ($a$-C) as a representative material system\nfrom the target X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra--a common\nexperimental technique to probe atomic structures of materials. We show that\nconditional generation guided by XANES spectra reproduces key features of the\ntarget structures.

    "summary": "In-situ Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is an instrumental technique\nthat has traditionally been used to understand how the choice of materials\nprocessing has the ability to change local structure and composition. However,\nmore recent advances to observe and react to transient changes occurring at the\nultrafast timescales that are now possible with EELS and Transmission Electron\nMicroscopy (TEM) will require new frameworks for characterization and analysis.\nWe describe a machine learning (ML) framework for the rapid assessment and\ncharacterization of in operando EELS Spectrum Images (EELS-SI) without the need\nfor many labeled training datapoints as typically required for deep learning\nclassification methods. By embedding computationally generated structures and\nexperimental datasets into an equivalent latent space through Variational\nAutoencoders (VAE), we effectively predict the structural changes at latency\nscales relevant to closed-loop processing within the TEM. The framework\ndescribed in this study is a critical step in enabling automated, on-the-fly\nsynthesis and characterization which will greatly advance capabilities for\nmaterials discovery and precision engineering of functional materials at the\natomic scale.",

In materials science, crystallographic texture is commonly\ndescribed by the orientation distribution function, which is defined as the\nprobability density function of the orientations of the monocrystal grains\nconforming a polycrystalline material. For representing the orientation\ndistribution function, there are several approaches such as using generalized\nspherical harmonics, orientation histograms, and pole figure images . Measuring\ndistances between crystallographic textures is essential for any task that\nrequires assessing texture similarities, e.g. to guide forming processes.\nTherefore, we introduce novel distance measures based on (i) the Earth Movers\nDistance that takes into account local distance information encoded in\nhistogram-based texture representations and (ii) a distance measure based on\npole figure images. For this purpose, we evaluate and compare existing distance\nmeasures for selected use-cases.

A deep generative model based on\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), conditioned simultaneously by two target\nproperties, is developed to inverse design stable magnetic materials. Structure\nof the physics informed, property embedded latent space of the model is\nanalyzed using graph theory, based on the idea of similarity index. The graph\nidea is shown to be useful for generating new materials that are likely to\nsatisfy target properties. An impressive ~96% of the generated materials is\nfound to satisfy the target properties as per predictions from the target\nlearning branches. This is a huge improvement over approaches that do not\ncondition the VAE latent space by target properties, or do not consider\nconnectivity of the parent materials perturbing which the new materials are\ngenerated. In such models, the fraction of materials satisfying targets can be\nas low as ~5%. This impressive feat is achieved using a simple real-space only\nrepresentation called Invertible Real-space Crystallographic Representation\n(IRCR), that can be directly read from material cif files. Model predictions\nare finally validated by performing DFT calculations on a randomly chosen\nsubset of materials. Performance of the present model using IRCR is comparable\nor superior to that of the models reported earlier.

    "summary": "Machine learning (ML) techniques and atomistic modeling have rapidly\ntransformed materials design and discovery. Specifically, generative models can\nswiftly propose promising materials for targeted applications. However, the\npredicted properties of materials through the generative models often do not\nmatch with calculated properties through ab initio calculations. This\ndiscrepancy can arise because the generated coordinates are not fully relaxed,\nwhereas the many properties are derived from relaxed structures. Neural\nnetwork-based potentials (NNPs) can expedite the process by providing relaxed\nstructures from the initially generated ones. Nevertheless, acquiring data to\ntrain NNPs for this purpose can be extremely challenging as it needs to\nencompass previously unknown structures. This study utilized extended ensemble\nmolecular dynamics (MD) to secure a broad range of liquid- and solid-phase\nconfigurations in one of the metallic systems, nickel. Then, we could\nsignificantly reduce them through active learning without losing much accuracy.\nWe found that the NNP trained from the distilled data could predict different\nenergy-minimized closed-pack crystal structures even though those structures\nwere not explicitly part of the initial data. Furthermore, the data can be\ntranslated to other metallic systems (aluminum and niobium), without repeating\nthe sampling and distillation processes. Our approach to data acquisition and\ndistillation has demonstrated the potential to expedite NNP development and\nenhance materials design and discovery by integrating generative models.",

This\nhas also included materials with heavy elements, beyond the stable isotopes of\nlead, as most actinides exhibit unique properties that make them useful in\nvarious applications. Furthermore, new heavy elements beyond actinides,\ncollectively referred to as super-heavy elements (SHEs), have been synthesized,\nfilling previously empty space of Mendeleev periodic table. Their chemical\nbonding behavior, of academic interest at present, would also benefit of\nstate-of-the-art modeling approaches. In particular, in order to perform\nfirst-principles calculations with planewave basis sets, one needs\ncorresponding pseudopotentials. In this work, we present a series of scalar-\nand fully-relativistic optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials\n(ONCVPs) for thirty-four actinides and super-heavy elements, for three\ndifferent exchange-correlation functionals (PBE, PBEsol and LDA). The\nscalar-relativistic version of these ONCVPs is tested by comparing equations of\nstates for crystals, obtained with \\textsc{abinit} 9.6, with those obtained by\nall-electron zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) calculations, without\nspin-orbit coupling, performed with the Amsterdam Modeling Suite \\textsc{band}\ncode. $\\Delta$-Gauge and $\\Delta_1$-Gauge indicators are used to validate these\npseudopotentials. This work is a contribution to the PseudoDojo project, in\nwhich pseudopotentials for the whole periodic table are developed and\nsystematically tested. The pseudopotential files are available on the\nPseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org in psp8 and UPF2 formats, both\nsuitable for \\textsc{abinit}, the latter being also suitable for Quantum\nESPRESSO.",

However, the force fields\ncurrently available for solids are rather specific and offer limited\ntransferability, making it time-consuming to use MD to study new materials\nsystems since a new force field must be parameterized and tested first. The\nlack of a generalized force field applicable to a broad spectrum of solid\nmaterials hinders the facile deployment of MD in computer-aided materials\ndiscovery (CAMD). Here, by utilizing a deep-neural network with a\nself-attention scheme, we have developed a unified force field that enables MD\nsimulations of perovskite oxides involving 14 metal elements and conceivably\ntheir solid solutions with arbitrary compositions. Notably, isobaric-isothermal\nensemble MD simulations with this model potential accurately predict the\nexperimental phase transition sequences for several markedly different\nferroelectric oxides, including a 6-element ternary solid solution,\nPb(In$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$--Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$--PbTiO$_3$. We\nbelieve the universal interatomic potential along with the training database,\nproposed regression tests, and the auto-testing workflow, all released\npublicly, will pave the way for a systematic improvement and extension of a\nunified force field for solids, potentially heralding a new era in CAMD.",

The effectiveness of this approach is\nbenchmarked on three known metastable systems: XeN$_8$, with a two-dimensional\npolymeric nitrogen sublattice, brookite TiO$_2$, and a high pressure BaH$_4$\nphase that was recently characterized. Additionally, a newly predicted\nmetastable melaminate salt, $P$-1 WC$_{3}$N$_{6}$, was found to possess an\nenergy that is lower than two phases proposed in a recent computational study.\nThe method presented here could help in identifying the structures of compounds\nthat have already been synthesized, and developing new synthesis targets with\ndesired properties.",

    "summary": "Transformer neural networks show promising capabilities, in particular for\nuses in materials analysis, design and manufacturing, including their capacity\nto work effectively with both human language, symbols, code, and numerical\ndata. Here we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as a tool that\ncan support engineering analysis of materials, applied to retrieving key\ninformation about subject areas, developing research hypotheses, discovery of\nmechanistic relationships across disparate areas of knowledge, and writing and\nexecuting simulation codes for active knowledge generation based on physical\nground truths. When used as sets of AI agents with specific features,\ncapabilities, and instructions, LLMs can provide powerful problem solution\nstrategies for applications in analysis and design problems. Our experiments\nfocus on using a fine-tuned model, MechGPT, developed based on training data in\nthe mechanics of materials domain. We first affirm how finetuning endows LLMs\nwith reasonable understanding of domain knowledge. However, when queried\noutside the context of learned matter, LLMs can have difficulty to recall\ncorrect information. We show how this can be addressed using\nretrieval-augmented Ontological Knowledge Graph strategies that discern how the\nmodel understands what concepts are important and how they are related.\nIllustrated for a use case of relating distinct areas of knowledge - here,\nmusic and proteins - such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph\nstructure with rich information at the node, edge and subgraph level. We\ndiscuss nonlinear sampling strategies and agent-based modeling applied to\ncomplex question answering, code generation and execution in the context of\nautomated force field development from actively learned Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) modeling, and data analysis.",

    "summary": "Materials discovery and design typically proceeds through iterative\nevaluation (both experimental and computational) to obtain data, generally\ntargeting improvement of one or more properties under one or more constraints\n(e.g., time or budget). However, there can be great variation in the quality\nand cost of different data, and when they are mixed together in what we here\ncall multifidelity data the optimal approaches to their utilization are not\nestablished. It is therefore important to develop strategies to acquire and use\nmultifidelity data to realize the most efficient iterative materials\nexploration. In this work, we assess the impact of using multifidelity data\nthrough mock demonstration of designing solar cell materials, using the\nelectronic bandgap as the target property. We propose a new approach of using\nmultifidelity data through leveraging machine learning models of both low- and\nhigh-fidelity data, where using predicted low-fidelity data as an input feature\nin the high-fidelity model can improve the impact of a multifidelity data\napproach. We show how tradeoffs of low- versus high-fidelity measurement cost\nand acquisition can impact the materials discovery process, and find that the\nuse of multifidelity data has maximal impact on the materials discovery\ncampaign when approximately five low-fidelity measurements per high-fidelity\nmeasurement are performed, and when the cost of low-fidelity measurements is\napproximately 5% or less than that of high-fidelity measurements. This work\nprovides practical guidance and useful qualitative measures for improving\nmaterials discovery campaigns that involve multifidelity data.",

Thus,\nlimited high-quality data, especially for novel materials, poses a significant\nchallenge in developing reliable ML models.

    "summary": "Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is the study of the influence of any given\ninputs on the outputs of a model. In the context of engineering design, GSA has\nbeen widely used to understand both individual and collective contributions of\ndesign variables on the design objectives. So far, global sensitivity studies\nhave often been limited to design spaces with only quantitative (numerical)\ndesign variables. However, many engineering systems also contain, if not only,\nqualitative (categorical) design variables in addition to quantitative design\nvariables. In this paper, we integrate Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP)\nwith Sobol' analysis to develop the first metamodel-based mixed-variable GSA\nmethod. Through numerical case studies, we validate and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method for mixed-variable problems. Furthermore,\nwhile the proposed GSA method is general enough to benefit various engineering\ndesign applications, we integrate it with multi-objective Bayesian optimization\n(BO) to create a sensitivity-aware design framework in accelerating the Pareto\nfront design exploration for metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with\nmany-level combinatorial design spaces. Although MOFs are constructed only from\nqualitative variables that are notoriously difficult to design, our method can\nutilize sensitivity analysis to navigate the optimization in the many-level\nlarge combinatorial design space, greatly expediting the exploration of novel\nMOF candidates.",

This study presents a generalized inverse design method for 3D\nmetamaterial morphing that can be used for structural applications with shape\nlocking. Topologically variable morphing enables the manufacture of volumetric\nstructures on a 2D plane, saving tremendous energy and materials compared with\nconventional 3D printing.

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning have shown great promise in\ntheir ability to accelerate novel materials discovery. As researchers and\ndomain scientists seek to unify and consolidate chemical knowledge, the case\nfor models with potential to generalize across different tasks within materials\nscience - so-called \"foundation models\" - grows with ambitions. This manuscript\nreviews our recent progress with development of Open MatSci ML Toolkit, and\ndetails experiments that lay the groundwork for foundation model research and\ndevelopment with our framework. First, we describe and characterize a new\npretraining task that uses synthetic data generated from symmetry operations,\nand reveal complex training dynamics at large scales. Using the pretrained\nmodel, we discuss a number of use cases relevant to foundation model\ndevelopment: semantic architecture of datasets, and fine-tuning for property\nprediction and classification. Our key results show that for simple\napplications, pretraining appears to provide worse modeling performance than\ntraining models from random initialization. However, for more complex\ninstances, such as when a model is required to learn across multiple datasets\nand types of targets simultaneously, the inductive bias from pretraining\nprovides significantly better performance. This insight will hopefully inform\nsubsequent efforts into creating foundation models for materials science\napplications.",

    "summary": "Inverse design refers to the problem of optimizing the input of an objective\nfunction in order to enact a target outcome. For many real-world engineering\nproblems, the objective function takes the form of a simulator that predicts\nhow the system state will evolve over time, and the design challenge is to\noptimize the initial conditions that lead to a target outcome. Recent\ndevelopments in learned simulation have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs)\ncan be used for accurate, efficient, differentiable estimation of simulator\ndynamics, and support high-quality design optimization with gradient- or\nsampling-based optimization procedures. However, optimizing designs from\nscratch requires many expensive model queries, and these procedures exhibit\nbasic failures on either non-convex or high-dimensional problems. In this work,\nwe show how denoising diffusion models (DDMs) can be used to solve inverse\ndesign problems efficiently and propose a particle sampling algorithm for\nfurther improving their efficiency. We perform experiments on a number of fluid\ndynamics design challenges, and find that our approach substantially reduces\nthe number of calls to the simulator compared to standard techniques.",

    "summary": "Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly popular for predicting\nmaterial properties to accelerate materials discovery. Because material\nproperties are strongly affected by its crystal structure, a key issue is\nconverting the crystal structure into the features for input to the ML model.\nCurrently, the most common method is to convert the crystal structure into a\ngraph and predicting its properties using a graph neural network (GNN). Some\nGNN models, such as crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) and\natomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN), have achieved highly accurate\npredictions of material properties. Despite these successes, using a graph to\nrepresent a crystal structure has the notable limitation of losing the crystal\nstructure's three-dimensional (3D) information. In this work, we propose\nDeepCrysTet, a novel deep learning approach for predicting material properties,\nwhich uses crystal structures represented as a 3D tetrahedral mesh generated by\nDelaunay tetrahedralization. DeepCrysTet provides a useful framework that\nincludes a 3D mesh generation method, mesh-based feature design, and neural\nnetwork design. The experimental results using the Materials Project dataset\nshow that DeepCrysTet significantly outperforms existing GNN models in\nclassifying crystal structures and achieves state-of-the-art performance in\npredicting elastic properties.",

Here, we propose a four-step\nstrategy that mathematically derives comprehensive guiding principles for the\nsearch and design for materials of general higher-order Tsc phases.\nSpecifically, such recipes consist of conditions on the normal state and\npairing symmetry that can lead to a given higher-order Tsc state. We\ndemonstrate this strategy by obtaining recipes for achieving three-dimensional\nhigher-order Tsc phases protected by the inversion symmetry. Following our\nrecipe, we predict that the observed superconductivity in centrosymmetric\nMoTe$_2$ is a candidate for higher-order Tsc with corner modes. Our proposed\nstrategy enables systematic materials search and design for higher-order Tsc,\nwhich can mobilize the experimental efforts and accelerate the material\ndiscovery for higher-order Tsc phases.",

The\nstrategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained\nparticle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over\nmesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed\napproach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly\nfrom particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different\nboundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate\nboundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced\nvia the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.\nThe model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial\nintelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over\ntime. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long\ntrajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under\ndifferent types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the\nimportance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle\ndiffusion inside a single block.

    "summary": "Some magnetic systems display a shift in the center of their magnetic\nhysteresis loop away from zero field, a phenomenon termed exchange bias.\nDespite the extensive use of the exchange bias effect, particularly in magnetic\nmultilayers, for the design of spin-based memory/electronics devices, a\ncomprehensive mechanistic understanding of this effect remains a longstanding\nproblem. Recent work has shown that disorder-induced spin frustration might\nplay a key role in exchange bias, suggesting new materials design approaches\nfor spin-based electronic devices that harness this effect. Here, we design a\nspin glass with strong spin frustration induced by magnetic disorder by\nexploiting the distinctive structure of Fe intercalated ZrSe2, where Fe(II)\ncenters are shown to occupy both octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites\nand to distribute between ZrSe2 layers without long-range structural order.\nNotably, we observe behavior consistent with a magnetically frustrated, and\nmulti-degenerate ground state in these Fe0.17ZrSe2 single crystals, which\npersists above room temperature. Moreover, this magnetic frustration leads to a\nrobust and tunable exchange bias up to 250 K. These results not only offer\nimportant insights into the effects of magnetic disorder and frustration in\nmagnetic materials generally, but also highlight as design strategy the idea\nthat a large exchange bias can arise from an inhomogeneous microscopic\nenvironment without discernible long-range magnetic order. In addition, these\nresults show that intercalated TMDs like Fe0.17ZrSe2 hold potential for\nspintronics technologies that can achieve room temperature applications.",

Here, we\nassess how one state-of-the-art generative model, the physics-guided crystal\ngeneration model (PGCGM), can be used as part of the inverse design process. We\nshow that the default PGCGM's input space is not smooth with respect to\nparameter variation, making material optimization difficult and limited. We\nalso demonstrate that most generated structures are predicted to be\nthermodynamically unstable by a separate property-prediction model, partially\ndue to out-of-domain data challenges.

However, this approach suffers from several\nshortcomings, such as philosophical disagreement, mutual incompatibility, and\nlack of interpretability. These shortcomings have spurred the research on\ncomplementary bias detection methods that offer additional transparency into\nthe sources of discrimination and are agnostic towards an a priori decision on\nthe definition of fairness and choice of protected features. A recent proposal\nin this direction is LUCID (Locating Unfairness through Canonical Inverse\nDesign), where canonical sets are generated by performing gradient descent on\nthe input space, revealing a model's desired input given a preferred output.\nThis information about the model's mechanisms, i.e., which feature values are\nessential to obtain specific outputs, allows exposing potential unethical\nbiases in its internal logic. Here, we present LUCID-GAN, which generates\ncanonical inputs via a conditional generative model instead of gradient-based\ninverse design. LUCID-GAN has several benefits, including that it applies to\nnon-differentiable models, ensures that canonical sets consist of realistic\ninputs, and allows to assess proxy and intersectional discrimination. We\nempirically evaluate LUCID-GAN on the UCI Adult and COMPAS data sets and show\nthat it allows for detecting unethical biases in black-box models without\nrequiring access to the training data.",

We\nshow that coherent driving of the crystal lattice in bi- and multilayer\ngraphene, boosts the coupling between two doubly-degenerate modes of E1u and\nE2g symmetry, which are virtually uncoupled at equilibrium. New vibronic states\nresult from anharmonic driving of the E1u mode to large amplitdues, boosting\nits coupling to the E2g mode. The vibrational structure of the driven state is\nprobed with time-resolved Raman scattering, which reveals laser-field dependent\nmode splitting and enhanced lifetimes.

    "summary": "Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is concerned with the development of\nlearned emulators of physical systems governed by partial differential\nequations (PDE). In application domains such as weather forecasting, molecular\ndynamics, and inverse design, ML-based surrogate models are increasingly used\nto augment or replace inefficient and often non-differentiable numerical\nsimulation algorithms. While a number of ML-based methods for approximating the\nsolutions of PDEs have been proposed in recent years, they typically do not\nadapt to the parameters of the PDEs, making it difficult to generalize to PDE\nparameters not seen during training. We propose a Channel Attention mechanism\nguided by PDE Parameter Embeddings (CAPE) component for neural surrogate models\nand a simple yet effective curriculum learning strategy. The CAPE module can be\ncombined with neural PDE solvers allowing them to adapt to unseen PDE\nparameters. The curriculum learning strategy provides a seamless transition\nbetween teacher-forcing and fully auto-regressive training. We compare CAPE in\nconjunction with the curriculum learning strategy using a popular PDE benchmark\nand obtain consistent and significant improvements over the baseline models.\nThe experiments also show several advantages of CAPE, such as its increased\nability to generalize to unseen PDE parameters without large increases\ninference time and parameter count.",

Moreover, the conditional formulation\nof DGM for guidance to the embedded desired material properties with a\ntransformer-based attention mechanism enables the inverse design of\nmultifunctional composites. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nsurrogate model is utilized to analyze the nonlinear material behavior to\nfacilitate the prediction of material properties for building\nmicrostructure-property linkages. Combined, these generative and surrogate\nmodels enable large data processing and database construction that is often not\naffordable with resource-intensive finite element method (FEM)-based direct\nnumerical simulation (DNS) and iterative reconstruction methods. An example\ncase is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,\nwhich is designing mechanoluminescence (ML) particulate composites made of\neuropium and dysprosium ions. The results show that the inversely-designed\nmultiple ML microstructure candidates with the proposed generative and\nsurrogate models meet the multiple design requirements (e.g., volume fraction,\nelastic constant, and light sensitivity). The evaluation of the generated\nsamples' quality and the surrogate models' performance using appropriate\nmetrics are also included. This assessment demonstrates that the proposed\nintegrated methodology offers an end-to-end solution for practical material\ndesign applications.",

In particular, LIB manufacturing is very important to be\noptimized because it determines the practical performance of the cells when the\nlatter are being used in applications such as electric vehicles. In this study,\nwe tackled the issue of high-performance electrodes for desired battery\napplication conditions by proposing a powerful data-driven approach supported\nby a deterministic machine learning (ML)-assisted pipeline for bi-objective\noptimization of the electrochemical performance. This ML pipeline allows the\ninverse design of the process parameters to adopt in order to manufacture\nelectrodes for energy or power applications. The latter work is an analogy to\nour previous work that supported the optimization of the electrode\nmicrostructures for kinetic, ionic, and electronic transport properties\nimprovement. An electrochemical pseudo-two-dimensional model is fed with the\nelectrode properties characterizing the electrode microstructures generated by\nmanufacturing simulations and used to simulate the electrochemical\nperformances. Secondly, the resulting dataset was used to train a deterministic\nML model to implement fast bi-objective optimizations to identify optimal\nelectrodes. Our results suggested a high amount of active material, combined\nwith intermediate values of solid content in the slurry and calendering degree,\nto achieve the optimal electrodes.",

The relationships between them, defined by the\npresence of ions at specific sites and weighted according to the thermodynamic\nstability of the respective compounds, allowed us to generate an embedding\nspace that contains vector representations for each ion and each site. Through\nthe correlation of ion-site occupancy with their respective distances within\nthe embedding space, we explored new ion-site occupancies, facilitating the\ndiscovery of novel stable compounds. Moreover, the graph's embedding space\nenabled a comprehensive examination of chemical similarities among elements,\nand a detailed analysis of local geometries of sites.

    "summary": "Tackling the most pressing problems for humanity, such as the climate crisis\nand the threat of global pandemics, requires accelerating the pace of\nscientific discovery. While science has traditionally relied on trial and error\nand even serendipity to a large extent, the last few decades have seen a surge\nof data-driven scientific discoveries. However, in order to truly leverage\nlarge-scale data sets and high-throughput experimental setups, machine learning\nmethods will need to be further improved and better integrated in the\nscientific discovery pipeline. A key challenge for current machine learning\nmethods in this context is the efficient exploration of very large search\nspaces, which requires techniques for estimating reducible (epistemic)\nuncertainty and generating sets of diverse and informative experiments to\nperform. This motivated a new probabilistic machine learning framework called\nGFlowNets, which can be applied in the modeling, hypotheses generation and\nexperimental design stages of the experimental science loop. GFlowNets learn to\nsample from a distribution given indirectly by a reward function corresponding\nto an unnormalized probability, which enables sampling diverse, high-reward\ncandidates. GFlowNets can also be used to form efficient and amortized Bayesian\nposterior estimators for causal models conditioned on the already acquired\nexperimental data. Having such posterior models can then provide estimators of\nepistemic uncertainty and information gain that can drive an experimental\ndesign policy. Altogether, here we will argue that GFlowNets can become a\nvaluable tool for AI-driven scientific discovery, especially in scenarios of\nvery large candidate spaces where we have access to cheap but inaccurate\nmeasurements or to expensive but accurate measurements. This is a common\nsetting in the context of drug and material discovery, which we use as examples\nthroughout the paper.",

We\nutilize crystal graph neural networks (CGNN) to predict crystal properties with\nDFT level accuracy, through graphs with encoding of the atomic (node/vertex),\nbond (edge), and global state attributes. In this work, we aim at testing the\nability of the CGNN MegNet framework in predicting a number of properties of\nsystems previously unseen from the model, obtained by adding a substitutional\ndefect in bulk crystals that are included in the training set. We perform DFT\nvalidation to assess the accuracy in the prediction of formation energies and\nstructural features (such as elastic moduli).

For\nthese scientific problems, molecules serve as the fundamental building blocks,\nand machine learning has emerged as a highly effective and powerful tool for\nmodeling their geometric structures. Nevertheless, due to the rapidly evolving\nprocess of the field and the knowledge gap between science (e.g., physics,\nchemistry, & biology) and machine learning communities, a benchmarking study on\ngeometrical representation for such data has not been conducted. To address\nsuch an issue, in this paper, we first provide a unified view of the current\nsymmetry-informed geometric methods, classifying them into three main\ncategories: invariance, equivariance with spherical frame basis, and\nequivariance with vector frame basis. Then we propose a platform, coined\nGeom3D, which enables benchmarking the effectiveness of geometric strategies.\nGeom3D contains 16 advanced symmetry-informed geometric representation models\nand 14 geometric pretraining methods over 46 diverse datasets, including small\nmolecules, proteins, and crystalline materials. We hope that Geom3D can, on the\none hand, eliminate barriers for machine learning researchers interested in\nexploring scientific problems; and, on the other hand, provide valuable\nguidance for researchers in computational chemistry, structural biology, and\nmaterials science, aiding in the informed selection of representation\ntechniques for specific applications.",

To address this problem, this work proposes a Simplicial\nMessage Passing (SMP) framework to better capture the topological information\nfrom molecules, which can break through the limitation within the vanilla\nmessage-passing paradigm. In SMP, a generalized message-passing framework is\nestablished for aggregating the information from arbitrary-order simplicial\ncomplex, and a hierarchical structure is elaborated to allow information\nexchange between different order simplices. We apply the SMP framework within\ndeep learning architectures for quantum-chemical properties prediction and\nachieve state-of-the-art results. The results show that compared to traditional\nMPNN, involving higher-order simplex can better capture the complex structure\nof molecules and substantially enhance the performance of tasks. The SMP-based\nmodel can provide a generalized framework for GNNs and aid in the discovery and\ndesign of materials with tailored properties for various applications.",

    "summary": "This is the second and the final part of the review on density functional\ntheory (DFT), referred to as DFT-II. In the first review, DFT-I, we have\ndiscussed wavefunction-based methods, their complexity, and the basic of\ndensity functional theory. In DFT-II, we focus on fundamentals of DFT and their\nimplications for the betterment of the theory. We start our presentation with\nthe exact DFT result followed by the concept of exchange-correlation (xc) or\nFermi-Coulomb hole and its relation with xc energy functional. We also provide\nthe exact conditions for the xc-hole, xc-energy and xc-potential along with\ntheir physical interpretation. Next, we describe the extension of DFT for\nnon-integer numbers of electrons, the piecewise linearity of total energy and\ndiscontinuity of chemical potential at integer particle numbers, and derivative\ndiscontinuity of the xc potential, which has consequences on fundamental gap of\nsolids. After that, we present how one obtain more accurate xc energy\nfunctionals by going beyond LDA. We discuss the gradient expansion\napproximation (GEA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and hybrid\nfunctional approaches to designing better xc energy functionals that give\naccurate total energies but fail to predict properties like the ionization\npotential and the band gap. Thus, we describe different methods of modeling\nthese potentials and the results of their application for the calculation of\nthe band gaps of different solids to highlight accuracy of different xc\npotential. Finally, we conclude with a glimpse on orbital-free density\nfunctional theory and the machine learning approach .",

    "summary": "Molecular representation learning is a crucial task in predicting molecular\nproperties. Molecules are often modeled as graphs where atoms and chemical\nbonds are represented as nodes and edges, respectively, and Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have been commonly utilized to predict atom-related properties,\nsuch as reactivity and solubility. However, functional groups (subgraphs) are\nclosely related to some chemical properties of molecules, such as efficacy, and\nmetabolic properties, which cannot be solely determined by individual atoms. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new model for molecular representation learning\ncalled the Atomic and Subgraph-aware Bilateral Aggregation (ASBA), which\naddresses the limitations of previous atom-wise and subgraph-wise models by\nincorporating both types of information. ASBA consists of two branches, one for\natom-wise information and the other for subgraph-wise information. Considering\nexisting atom-wise GNNs cannot properly extract invariant subgraph features, we\npropose a decomposition-polymerization GNN architecture for the subgraph-wise\nbranch. Furthermore, we propose cooperative node-level and graph-level\nself-supervised learning strategies for ASBA to improve its generalization. Our\nmethod offers a more comprehensive way to learn representations for molecular\nproperty prediction and has broad potential in drug and material discovery\napplications. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nmethod.",

The discovery framework consists of a joint scheme that\nfirst recalls relevant candidates, and next ranks the candidates based on\nmultiple target properties. The contextual knowledge encoded in language\nrepresentations conveys information about material properties and structures,\nenabling both representational similarity analysis for recall, and multi-task\nlearning to share information across related properties. By applying the\nframework to thermoelectrics, we demonstrate diversified recommendations of\nprototype structures and identify under-studied high-performance material\nspaces. The recommended materials are corroborated by first-principles\ncalculations and experiments, revealing novel materials with potential high\nperformance. Our framework provides a task-agnostic means for effective\nmaterial recommendation and can be applied to various material systems.",

Monolayer MX2\nphases represent a particularly compelling case for defect engineering of\nnanomaterials due to the large variability in their physical properties as\ndifferent defects are introduced into their structure. However, effective\nidentification and quantification of defects remains a challenge even as\nhigh-throughput scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM) methods improve.\nThis study highlights the benefits of employing first principles calculations\nto produce digital twins for training deep learning segmentation models for\ndefect identification in monolayer MX2 phases. Around 600 defect structures\nwere obtained using density functional theory calculations, with each monolayer\nMX2 structure being subjected to multislice simulations for the purpose of\ngenerating the digital twins. Several deep learning segmentation architectures\nwere trained on this dataset, and their performances evaluated under a variety\nof conditions such as recognizing defects in the presence of unidentified\nimpurities, beam damage, grain boundaries, and with reduced image quality from\nlow electron doses. This digital twin approach allows benchmarking different\ndeep learning architectures on a theory dataset, which enables the study of\ndefect classification under a broad array of finely controlled conditions. It\nthus opens the door to resolving the underpinning physical reasons for model\nshortcomings, and potentially chart paths forward for automated discovery of\nmaterials defect phases in experiments.",

    "summary": "Traditional solid-state physics has long correlated the optical properties of\nmaterials with their electronic structures. However, recent discoveries of\nintrinsic gapped metals have challenged this classical view. Gapped metals\npossess electronic properties distinct from both metals and insulators, with a\nlarge concentration of free carriers without any intentional doping and an\ninternal band gap. This unique electronic structure makes gapped metals\npotentially superior to materials designed by intentional doping of the wide\nband gap insulators. Despite their promising applications, such as transparent\nconductors, designing gapped metals for specific purposes remains challenging\ndue to the lack of understanding of the correlation between their electronic\nband structures and optical properties. This study focuses on representative\nexamples of gapped metals and demonstrates the cases of (i) gapped metals\n(e.g., CaN2) with strong intraband absorption in the visible range, (ii) gapped\nmetals (e.g., SrNbO3) with strong interband absorption in the visible range,\n(iii) gapped metals (e.g., Sr5Nb5O17) that are potential transparent\nconductors. We explore the complexity of identifying potential gapped metals\nfor transparent conductors and propose inverse materials design principles for\ndiscovering new-generation transparent conductors.",

    "summary": "Conventional meta-atom designs rely heavily on researchers' prior knowledge\nand trial-and-error searches using full-wave simulations, resulting in\ntime-consuming and inefficient processes. Inverse design methods based on\noptimization algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms, and topological\noptimizations, have been introduced to design metamaterials. However, none of\nthese algorithms are general enough to fulfill multi-objective tasks. Recently,\ndeep learning methods represented by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nhave been applied to inverse design of metamaterials, which can directly\ngenerate high-degree-of-freedom meta-atoms based on S-parameter requirements.\nHowever, the adversarial training process of GANs makes the network unstable\nand results in high modeling costs. This paper proposes a novel metamaterial\ninverse design method based on the diffusion probability theory. By learning\nthe Markov process that transforms the original structure into a Gaussian\ndistribution, the proposed method can gradually remove the noise starting from\nthe Gaussian distribution and generate new high-degree-of-freedom meta-atoms\nthat meet S-parameter conditions, which avoids the model instability introduced\nby the adversarial training process of GANs and ensures more accurate and\nhigh-quality generation results. Experiments have proven that our method is\nsuperior to representative methods of GANs in terms of model convergence speed,\ngeneration accuracy, and quality.",

However,\nfurther refinement of methodology is highly desired as most existing methods\nlack unified modeling of 2D topology and 3D geometry information and fail to\neffectively learn the structure-property relationship for molecule design. Here\nwe present MolCode, a roto-translation equivariant generative framework for\n\\underline{Mol}ecular graph-structure \\underline{Co-de}sign. In MolCode, 3D\ngeometric information empowers the molecular 2D graph generation, which in turn\nhelps guide the prediction of molecular 3D structure. Extensive experimental\nresults show that MolCode outperforms previous methods on a series of\nchallenging tasks including \\emph{de novo} molecule design, targeted molecule\ndiscovery, and structure-based drug design. Particularly, MolCode not only\nconsistently generates valid (99.95$\\%$ Validity) and diverse (98.75$\\%$\nUniqueness) molecular graphs/structures with desirable properties, but also\ngenerate drug-like molecules with high affinity to target proteins (61.8$\\%$\nhigh-affinity ratio), which demonstrates MolCode's potential applications in\nmaterial design and drug discovery.

This is expected to\nbe useful in the compact modeling of novel devices when only device\ncross-sectional images and electrical characteristics are available (e.g. novel\nemerging memory). Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) generated and\nhand-drawn Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) device images and noisy\ndrain-current-gate-voltage curves (IDVG) are used for the demonstration. The\nframework is formed by stacking two VAEs (one for image manifold learning and\none for IDVG manifold learning) which communicate with each other through the\nlatent variables. Five independent variables with different strengths are used.\nIt is shown that it can perform inverse design (generate a design structure for\na given IDVG) and forward prediction (predict IDVG for a given structure image,\nwhich can be used for compact modeling if the image is treated as device\nparameters) successfully. Since manifold learning is used, the machine is shown\nto be robust against noise in the inputs (i.e. using hand-drawn images and\nnoisy IDVG curves) and not confused by weak and irrelevant independent\nvariables.",

The framework\nemploys an encoder to project high-dimensional input information (e.g., loading\nhistory, loading conditions, and materials information) to a lower-dimensional\nhidden space and a decoder to map the hidden representation to the stress of\ninterest. We evaluated various encoder architectures, including gated recurrent\nunit (GRU), GRU with attention, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the\nTransformer encoder, on two complex stress-strain datasets that were designed\nto include a wide range of complex loading histories and loading conditions.\nAll architectures achieved excellent test results with an RMSE below 1 MPa.\nAdditionally, we analyzed the capability of the different architectures to make\npredictions on out-of-domain applications, with an uncertainty estimation based\non deep ensembles. The proposed approach provides a robust alternative to\nempirical/semi-empirical models for CRs modeling, offering the potential for\nmore accurate and efficient materials design and optimization.",

However, unless the\noptimization is heavily constrained, the generated small features are not\nreliably fabricated, leading to optical performance degradation. Even for\nsimpler, conventional designs, fabrication-induced performance degradation\nstill occurs. The degree of deviation from the original design not only depends\non the size and shape of its features, but also on the distribution of features\nand the surrounding environment, presenting complex, proximity-dependent\nbehavior. Without proprietary fabrication process specifications, design\ncorrections can only be made after calibrating fabrication runs take place. In\nthis work, we introduce a general deep machine learning model that\nautomatically corrects photonic device design layouts prior to first\nfabrication. Only a small set of scanning electron microscopy images of\nengineered training features are required to create the deep learning model.\nWith correction, the outcome of the fabricated layout is closer to what is\nintended, and thus so too is the performance of the design.

    "summary": "This paper introduces WhereWulff, a semi-autonomous workflow for modeling the\nreactivity of catalyst surfaces. The workflow begins with a bulk optimization\ntask that takes an initial bulk structure, and returns the optimized bulk\ngeometry and magnetic state, including stability under reaction conditions. The\nstable bulk structure is the input to a surface chemistry task that enumerates\nsurfaces up to a user-specified maximum Miller index, computes relaxed surface\nenergies for those surfaces, and then prioritizes those for subsequent\nadsorption energy calculations based on their contribution to the Wulff\nconstruction shape. The workflow handles computational resource constraints\nsuch as limited wall-time as well as automated job submission and analysis. We\nillustrate the workflow for oxygen evolution (OER) intermediates on two double\nperovskites. WhereWulff nearly halved the number of Density Functional Theory\n(DFT) calculations from ~ 240 to ~ 132 by prioritizing terminations, up to a\nmaximum Miller index of 1, based on surface stability. Additionally, it\nautomatically handled the 180 additional re-submission jobs required to\nsuccessfully converge 120+ atoms systems under a 48-hour wall-time cluster\nconstraint. There are four main use cases that we envision for WhereWulff: (1)\nas a first-principles source of truth to validate and update a closed-loop\nself-sustaining materials discovery pipeline, (2) as a data generation tool,\n(3) as an educational tool, allowing users (e.g. experimentalists) unfamiliar\nwith OER modeling to probe materials they might be interested in before doing\nfurther in-domain analyses, (4) and finally as a starting point for users to\nextend with reactions other than OER, as part of a collaborative software\ncommunity.",

By the arrangement of materials' internal components,\nstructure design is of great significance in tuning the properties of the\ncomposites. However, most of the composite structures are proposed by empirical\ndesigns following existing patterns. Hindered by the complexity of 3D\nstructures, it is hard to extract customized structures with multiple desired\nproperties from large design space. Here we report a multi-objective driven\nWasserstein generative adversarial network (MDWGAN) to implement inverse\ndesigns of 3D composite structures according to given geometrical, structural\nand mechanical requirements. Our framework consists a GAN based network which\ngenerates 3D composite structures possessing with similar geometrical and\nstructural features to the target dataset. Besides, multiple objectives are\nintroduced to our framework for the control of mechanical property and isotropy\nof the composites. Real time calculation of the properties in training\niterations is achieved by an accurate surrogate model. We constructed a small\nand concise dataset to illustrate our framework. With multiple objectives\ncombined by their weight, and the 3D-GAN act as a soft constraint, our\nframework is proved to be capable of tuning the properties of the generated\ncomposites in multiple aspects, while keeping the selected features of\ndifferent kinds of structures. The feasibility on small dataset and potential\nscalability on objectives of other properties make our work a novel, effective\napproach to provide fast, experience free composite structure designs for\nvarious functional materials.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a denoising diffusion algorithm to discover\nmicrostructures with nonlinear fine-tuned properties. Denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models are generative models that use diffusion-based dynamics to\ngradually denoise images and generate realistic synthetic samples. By learning\nthe reverse of a Markov diffusion process, we design an artificial intelligence\nto efficiently manipulate the topology of microstructures to generate a massive\nnumber of prototypes that exhibit constitutive responses sufficiently close to\ndesignated nonlinear constitutive responses. To identify the subset of\nmicrostructures with sufficiently precise fine-tuned properties, a\nconvolutional neural network surrogate is trained to replace high-fidelity\nfinite element simulations to filter out prototypes outside the admissible\nrange. The results of this study indicate that the denoising diffusion process\nis capable of creating microstructures of fine-tuned nonlinear material\nproperties within the latent space of the training data. More importantly, the\nresulting algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate additional\ntopological and geometric modifications by introducing high-dimensional\nstructures embedded in the latent space. The algorithm is tested on the\nopen-source mechanical MNIST data set. Consequently, this algorithm is not only\ncapable of performing inverse design of nonlinear effective media but also\nlearns the nonlinear structure-property map to quantitatively understand the\nmultiscale interplay among the geometry and topology and their effective\nmacroscopic properties.",

    "summary": "Optimizing molecular design and discovering novel chemical structures to meet\ncertain objectives, such as quantitative estimates of the drug-likeness score\n(QEDs), is NP-hard due to the vast combinatorial design space of discrete\nmolecular structures, which makes it near impossible to explore the entire\nsearch space comprehensively to exploit de novo structures with properties of\ninterest. To address this challenge, reducing the intractable search space into\na lower-dimensional latent volume helps examine molecular candidates more\nfeasibly via inverse design. Autoencoders are suitable deep learning\ntechniques, equipped with an encoder that reduces the discrete molecular\nstructure into a latent space and a decoder that inverts the search space back\nto the molecular design. The continuous property of the latent space, which\ncharacterizes the discrete chemical structures, provides a flexible\nrepresentation for inverse design in order to discover novel molecules.\nHowever, exploring this latent space requires certain insights to generate new\nstructures. We propose using a convex hall surrounding the top molecules in\nterms of high QEDs to ensnare a tight subspace in the latent representation as\nan efficient way to reveal novel molecules with high QEDs. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our suggested method by using the QM9 as a training dataset\nalong with the Self- Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) representation to\ncalibrate the autoencoder in order to carry out the Inverse molecular design\nthat leads to unfold novel chemical structure.",

    "summary": "Understanding material composition-structure-function relationships is of\ncritical importance for the design and discovery of novel functional materials.\nWhile most such studies focus on individual materials, we conducted a global\nmapping study of all known materials deposited in the Material Project database\nto investigate their distributions in the space of a set of seven\ncompositional, structural, physical, and neural latent descriptors. These\ntwo-dimensional materials maps along with their density maps allow us to\nillustrate the distribution of the patterns and clusters of different shapes,\nwhich indicates the propensity of these materials and the tinkering history of\nexisting materials. We then overlap the material properties such as composition\nprototypes and piezoelectric properties over the background materials maps to\nstudy the relationships of how material compositions and structures affect\ntheir physical properties. We also use these maps to study the spatial\ndistributions of properties of known inorganic materials, in particular those\nof local vicinities in structural space such as structural density and\nfunctional diversity. These maps provide a uniquely comprehensive overview of\nmaterials and space and thus reveal previously undescribed fundamental\nproperties. Our methodology can be easily extended by other researchers to\ngenerate their own global material maps with different background maps and\noverlap properties for both distribution understanding and cluster-based new\nmaterial discovery.

    "summary": "A key problem in network theory is how to reconfigure a graph in order to\noptimize a quantifiable objective. Given the ubiquity of networked systems,\nsuch work has broad practical applications in a variety of situations, ranging\nfrom drug and material design to telecommunications. The large decision space\nof possible reconfigurations, however, makes this problem computationally\nintensive. In this paper, we cast the problem of network rewiring for\noptimizing a specified structural property as a Markov Decision Process (MDP),\nin which a decision-maker is given a budget of modifications that are performed\nsequentially. We then propose a general approach based on the Deep Q-Network\n(DQN) algorithm and graph neural networks (GNNs) that can efficiently learn\nstrategies for rewiring networks. We then discuss a cybersecurity case study,\ni.e., an application to the computer network reconfiguration problem for\nintrusion protection. In a typical scenario, an attacker might have a (partial)\nmap of the system they plan to penetrate; if the network is effectively\n\"scrambled\", they would not be able to navigate it since their prior knowledge\nwould become obsolete. This can be viewed as an entropy maximization problem,\nin which the goal is to increase the surprise of the network. Indeed, entropy\nacts as a proxy measurement of the difficulty of navigating the network\ntopology. We demonstrate the general ability of the proposed method to obtain\nbetter entropy gains than random rewiring on synthetic and real-world graphs\nwhile being computationally inexpensive, as well as being able to generalize to\nlarger graphs than those seen during training. Simulations of attack scenarios\nconfirm the effectiveness of the learned rewiring strategies.",

We validate MPEGO using multiple generative models\nacross several datasets from the material discovery domain.

The results from these tests indicate that compared to the\nunstructured and randomly ordered schemes, chemically meaningful arrangements\nof elements within spatial representation schemes generally lead to better\nmodels.

However,\na design principle beyond specific materials systems for obtaining a large\nanomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is still absent. In this work, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that a pair of Dirac nodes under a Zeeman field\nmanifests a double-peak anomalous Hall conductivity curve with respect to the\nchemical potential and a compensated carriers feature, leading to an enhanced\nANC pinning at the Fermi level compared with that of a simple Weyl semimetal\nwith two Weyl nodes. Based on first-principles calculations, we then provide\ntwo Dirac semimetal candidates, i.e., Na3Bi and NaTeAu, and show that under a\nZeeman field they exhibit a sizable ANC value of 0.4 A/(m*K) and 1.3 A/(m*K),\nrespectively, near the Fermi level.

    "summary": "Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving\ninverse problems where the objective is to find the (multiple)\nmicroarchitectures that give rise to a given set of properties. The limited\nresolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such\ninverse problems for specific sizes. One should, therefore, find multiple\nmicroarchitectural designs that exhibit the desired properties for a specimen\nwith given dimensions. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be\nresistant to fatigue and fracture, meaning that peak stresses should be\nminimized as well. Such a multi-objective inverse design problem is formidably\ndifficult to solve but its solution is the key to real-world applications of\nmechanical metamaterials. Here, we propose a modular approach titled\n'Deep-DRAM' that combines four decoupled models, including two deep learning\nmodels (DLM), a deep generative model (DGM) based on conditional variational\nautoencoders (CVAE), and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep-DRAM\n(deep learning for the design of random-network metamaterials) integrates these\nmodels into a unified framework capable of finding many solutions to the\nmulti-objective inverse design problem posed here. The integrated framework\nfirst introduces the desired elastic properties to the DGM, which returns a set\nof candidate designs. The candidate designs, together with the target specimen\ndimensions are then passed to the DLM which predicts their actual elastic\nproperties considering the specimen size. After a filtering step based on the\ncloseness of the actual properties to the desired ones, the last step uses\ndirect FE simulations to identify the designs with the minimum peak stresses.",

    "summary": "The discovery of novel materials drives industrial innovation, although the\npace of discovery tends to be slow due to the infrequency of \"Eureka!\" moments.\nThese moments are typically tangential to the original target of the\nexperimental work: \"accidental discoveries\". Here we demonstrate the\nacceleration of intentional materials discovery - targeting material properties\nof interest while generalizing the search to a large materials space with\nmachine learning (ML) methods. We demonstrate a closed-loop ML discovery\nprocess targeting novel superconducting materials, which have industrial\napplications ranging from quantum computing to sensors to power delivery. By\nclosing the loop, i.e. by experimentally testing the results of the\nML-generated superconductivity predictions and feeding data back into the ML\nmodel to refine, we demonstrate that success rates for superconductor discovery\ncan be more than doubled. In four closed-loop cycles, we discovered a new\nsuperconductor in the Zr-In-Ni system, re-discovered five superconductors\nunknown in the training datasets, and identified two additional phase diagrams\nof interest for new superconducting materials. Our work demonstrates the\ncritical role experimental feedback provides in ML-driven discovery, and\nprovides definite evidence that such technologies can accelerate discovery even\nin the absence of knowledge of the underlying physics.",

    "summary": "Graphene quantum dots provide a platform for manipulating electron behaviors\nin two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials. Most previous works were of the\n\"forward\" type in that the objective was to solve various confinement,\ntransport and scattering problems with given structures that can be generated\nby, e.g., applying an external electrical field. There are applications such as\ncloaking or superscattering where the challenging problem of inverse design\nneeds to be solved: finding a quantum-dot structure according to certain\ndesired functional characteristics. A brute-force search of the system\nconfiguration based directly on the solutions of the Dirac equation is\ncomputational infeasible. We articulate a machine-learning approach to\naddressing the inverse-design problem where artificial neural networks subject\nto physical constraints are exploited to replace the rigorous Dirac equation\nsolver. In particular, we focus on the problem of designing a quantum dot\nstructure to generate both cloaking and superscattering in terms of the\nscattering efficiency as a function of the energy. We construct a physical loss\nfunction that enables accurate prediction of the scattering characteristics. We\ndemonstrate that, in the regime of Klein tunneling, the scattering efficiency\ncan be designed to vary over two orders of magnitudes, allowing any scattering\ncurve to be generated from a proper combination of the gate potentials. Our\nphysics-based machine-learning approach can be a powerful design tool for 2D\nDirac material-based electronics.",

    "summary": "Despite significant progress of generative models in the natural sciences,\ntheir controllability remains challenging. One fundamentally missing aspect of\nmolecular or protein generative models is an inductive bias that can reflect\ncontinuous properties of interest. To that end, we propose the Regression\nTransformer (RT), a novel method that abstracts regression as a conditional\nsequence modeling problem. This introduces a new paradigm of multitask language\nmodels which seamlessly bridge sequence regression and conditional sequence\ngeneration.\n  We thoroughly demonstrate that, despite using a nominal-scale training\nobjective, the RT matches or surpasses the performance of conventional\nregression models in property prediction tasks of small molecules, proteins and\nchemical reactions. Critically, priming the same model with continuous\nproperties yields a highly competitive conditional generative model that\noutperforms specialized approaches in a substructure-constrained,\nproperty-driven molecule generation benchmark. Our dichotomous approach is\nfacilitated by a novel, alternating training scheme that enables the model to\ndecorate seed sequences by desired properties, e.g., to optimize reaction\nyield.\n  In sum, the RT is the first report of a multitask model that concurrently\nexcels at predictive and generative tasks in biochemistry. This finds\nparticular application in property-driven, local exploration of the chemical or\nprotein space and could pave the road toward foundation models in material\ndesign.\n  The code to reproduce all experiments of the paper is available at:\nhttps://github.com/IBM/regression-transformer",

Depending on applications, the\ndispersion in such resonators counters their optical nonlinearities and\ninfluences the intracavity optical dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nuse of a machine learning (ML) algorithm as a tool to determine the geometry of\nmicroresonators from their dispersion profiles. The training dataset with ~460\nsamples is generated by finite element simulations and the model is\nexperimentally verified using integrated silicon nitride microresonators. Two\nML algorithms are compared along with suitable hyperparameter tuning, out of\nwhich Random Forest (RF) yields the best results. The average error on the\nsimulated data is well below 15%.",

    "summary": "There is an increasing need in our society to achieve faster advances in\nScience to tackle urgent problems, such as climate changes, environmental\nhazards, sustainable energy systems, pandemics, among others. In certain\ndomains like chemistry, scientific discovery carries the extra burden of\nassessing risks of the proposed novel solutions before moving to the\nexperimental stage. Despite several recent advances in Machine Learning and AI\nto address some of these challenges, there is still a gap in technologies to\nsupport end-to-end discovery applications, integrating the myriad of available\ntechnologies into a coherent, orchestrated, yet flexible discovery process.\nSuch applications need to handle complex knowledge management at scale,\nenabling knowledge consumption and production in a timely and efficient way for\nsubject matter experts (SMEs). Furthermore, the discovery of novel functional\nmaterials strongly relies on the development of exploration strategies in the\nchemical space. For instance, generative models have gained attention within\nthe scientific community due to their ability to generate enormous volumes of\nnovel molecules across material domains. These models exhibit extreme\ncreativity that often translates in low viability of the generated candidates.\nIn this work, we propose a workbench framework that aims at enabling the\nhuman-AI co-creation to reduce the time until the first discovery and the\nopportunity costs involved. This framework relies on a knowledge base with\ndomain and process knowledge, and user-interaction components to acquire\nknowledge and advise the SMEs. Currently,the framework supports four main\nactivities: generative modeling, dataset triage, molecule adjudication, and\nrisk assessment.",

Herein, we describe a\npolymer-unit fingerprint (PUFp) generation framework. Machine learning (ML)\nmodels can be used to determine structure-mobility relationships by using PUFp\ninformation as structural input with 678 pieces of collected OSC data. A\npolymer-unit library consisting of 445 units is constructed, and the key\npolymer units for the mobility of OSCs are identified. By investigating the\ncombinations of polymer units with mobility performance, a scheme for designing\npolymer OSC materials by combining ML approaches and PUFp information is\nproposed to not only passively predict OSC mobility but also actively provide\nstructural guidance for new high-mobility OSC material design. The proposed\nscheme demonstrates the ability to screen new materials through pre-evaluation\nand classification ML steps and is an alternative methodology for applying ML\nin new high-mobility OSC discovery.",

    "summary": "The high-dimesionality, non-linearity and emergent properties of complex\nsystems pose a challenge to identifying general laws in the same manner that\nhas been so successful in simpler physical systems. In Anderson's seminal work\non why \"more is different\" he pointed to how emergent, macroscale patterns\nbreak symmetries of the underlying microscale laws. Yet, less recognized is\nthat these large-scale, emergent patterns must also retain some symmetries of\nthe microscale rules. Here we introduce a new, relational macrostate theory\n(RMT) that defines macrostates in terms of symmetries between two mutually\npredictive observations, and develop a machine learning architecture, MacroNet,\nthat identifies macrostates. Using this framework, we show how macrostates can\nbe identifed across systems ranging in complexity from the simplicity of the\nsimple harmonic oscillator to the much more complex spatial patterning\ncharacteristic of Turing instabilities. Furthermore, we show how our framework\ncan be used for the inverse design of microstates consistent with a given\nmacroscopic property -- in Turing patterns this allows us to design underlying\nrule with a given specification of spatial patterning, and to identify which\nrule parameters most control these patterns. By demonstrating a general theory\nfor how macroscopic properties emerge from conservation of symmetries in the\nmapping between observations, we provide a machine learning framework that\nallows a unified approach to identifying macrostates in systems from the simple\nto complex, and allows the design of new examples consistent with a given\nmacroscopic property.",

Here we validate\nexperimentally the broad utility of a deep generative framework trained\nat-scale on protein sequences, small molecules, and their mutual interactions\n-- that is unbiased toward any specific target. As demonstrators, we consider\ntwo dissimilar and relevant SARS-CoV-2 targets: the main protease and the spike\nprotein (receptor binding domain, RBD). To perform target-aware design of novel\ninhibitor molecules, a protein sequence-conditioned sampling on the generative\nfoundation model is performed. Despite using only the target sequence\ninformation, and without performing any target-specific adaptation of the\ngenerative model, micromolar-level inhibition was observed in in vitro\nexperiments for two candidates out of only four synthesized for each target.\nThe most potent spike RBD inhibitor also exhibited activity against several\nvariants in live virus neutralization assays. These results therefore establish\nthat a single, broadly deployable generative foundation model for accelerated\nhit discovery is effective and efficient, even in the most general case where\nneither target structure nor binder information is available.",

Recently, Deep Learning\nand Reinforcement Learning have been been introduced to the task of designing\nthin-films with great success, however a trained network is usually only able\nto become proficient for a single target and must be retrained if the optical\ntargets are varied. In this work, we apply conditional Invertible Neural\nNetworks (cINN) to inversely designing multilayer thin-films given an optical\ntarget. Since the cINN learns the energy landscape of all thin-film\nconfigurations within the training dataset, we show that cINNs can generate a\nstochastic ensemble of proposals for thin-film configurations that that are\nreasonably close to the desired target depending only on random variables. By\nrefining the proposed configurations further by a local optimization, we show\nthat the generated thin-films reach the target with significantly greater\nprecision than comparable state-of-the art approaches. Furthermore, we tested\nthe generative capabilities on samples which are outside the training data\ndistribution and found that the cINN was able to predict thin-films for\nout-of-distribution targets, too. The results suggest that in order to improve\nthe generative design of thin-films, it is instructive to use established and\nnew machine learning methods in conjunction in order to obtain the most\nfavorable results.",

    "summary": "Periodic graphs are graphs consisting of repetitive local structures, such as\ncrystal nets and polygon mesh. Their generative modeling has great potential in\nreal-world applications such as material design and graphics synthesis.\nClassical models either rely on domain-specific predefined generation\nprinciples (e.g., in crystal net design), or follow geometry-based prescribed\nrules. Recently, deep generative models has shown great promise in\nautomatically generating general graphs. However, their advancement into\nperiodic graphs have not been well explored due to several key challenges in 1)\nmaintaining graph periodicity; 2) disentangling local and global patterns; and\n3) efficiency in learning repetitive patterns. To address them, this paper\nproposes Periodical-Graph Disentangled Variational Auto-encoder (PGD-VAE), a\nnew deep generative models for periodic graphs that can automatically learn,\ndisentangle, and generate local and global graph patterns. Specifically, we\ndevelop a new periodic graph encoder consisting of global-pattern encoder and\nlocal-pattern encoder that ensures to disentangle the representation into\nglobal and local semantics. We then propose a new periodic graph decoder\nconsisting of local structure decoder, neighborhood decoder, and global\nstructure decoder, as well as the assembler of their outputs that guarantees\nperiodicity. Moreover, we design a new model learning objective that helps\nensure the invariance of local-semantic representations for the graphs with the\nsame local structure. Comprehensive experimental evaluations have been\nconducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code of\nproposed PGD-VAE is availabe at https://github.com/shi-yu-wang/PGD-VAE.",

To rapidly\ndesign such topologies, we employ individual-based modeling and Bayesian\noptimization to automate the design process and generate different active\nsurfaces for effective biofilm removal. Our framework successfully generated\nideal nano-surfaces for biofilm removal through applied shear and vibration.\nDensely distributed short pillar topography is the optimal geometry to prevent\nbiofilm formation. Under fluidic shearing, the optimal topography is to\nsparsely distribute tall, slim, pillar-like structures. When subjected to\neither vertical or lateral vibrations, thick trapezoidal cones are found to be\noptimal. Optimizing the vibrational loading indicates a small vibration\nmagnitude with relatively low frequencies is more efficient in removing\nbiofilm.

Machine learning\nhas emerged as a promising approach to overcome current limitations imposed by\nthe dimensionality of the parameter space and multimodal parameter\ndistributions. Most traditional optimization routines assume an invertible\none-to-one mapping between the design parameters and the target performance.\nHowever, comparable or even identical performance may be realized by different\ndesigns, yielding a multimodal distribution of possible solutions to the\ninverse design problem which confuses the optimization algorithm. Here, we show\nhow a generative modeling approach based on invertible neural networks can\nprovide the full distribution of possible solutions to the inverse design\nproblem and resolve the ambiguity of nanodevice inverse design problems\nfeaturing multimodal distributions. We implement a Conditional Invertible\nNeural Network (cINN) and apply it to a proof-of-principle nanophotonic\nproblem, consisting in tailoring the transmission spectrum of a metallic film\nmilled by subwavelength indentations. We compare our approach with the commonly\nused conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) framework and show the superior\nflexibility and accuracy of the proposed cINNs when dealing with multimodal\ndevice distributions.

Relevant\ncriteria may be, for example, the presence of specific folding motifs, binding\nto molecular ligands, sensing properties, etc. Most practical approaches to\naptamer design identify a small set of promising candidate sequences using\nhigh-throughput experiments (e.g. SELEX), and then optimize performance by\nintroducing only minor modifications to the empirically found candidates.\nSequences that possess the desired properties but differ drastically in\nchemical composition will add diversity to the search space and facilitate the\ndiscovery of useful nucleic acid aptamers. Systematic diversification protocols\nare needed. Here we propose to use an unsupervised machine learning model known\nas the Potts model to discover new, useful sequences with controllable sequence\ndiversity. We start by training a Potts model using the maximum entropy\nprinciple on a small set of empirically identified sequences unified by a\ncommon feature. To generate new candidate sequences with a controllable degree\nof diversity, we take advantage of the model's spectral feature: an energy\nbandgap separating sequences that are similar to the training set from those\nthat are distinct. By controlling the Potts energy range that is sampled, we\ngenerate sequences that are distinct from the training set yet still likely to\nhave the encoded features. To demonstrate performance, we apply our approach to\ndesign diverse pools of sequences with specified secondary structure motifs in\n30-mer RNA and DNA aptamers.",

    "summary": "A central aim of materials discovery is an accurate and numerically reliable\ndescription of thermodynamic properties, such as the enthalpies of formation\nand decomposition. The r$^2$SCAN revision of the strongly constrained and\nappropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA)\nbalances numerical stability with high general accuracy. To assess the\nr$^2$SCAN description of solid-state thermodynamics, we evaluate the formation\nand decomposition enthalpies, equilibrium volumes, and fundamental bandgaps of\nmore than 1,000 solids using r$^2$SCAN, SCAN, and PBE, as well as two\ndispersion-corrected variants, SCAN+rVV10 and r$^2$SCAN+rVV10. We show that\nr$^2$SCAN achieves accuracy comparable to SCAN and often improves upon SCAN's\nalready excellent accuracy. Whereas SCAN+rVV10 is often observed to worsen the\nformation enthalpies of SCAN, and makes no substantial correction to SCAN's\ncell volume predictions, r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 predicts marginally less-accurate\nformation enthalpies than r$^2$SCAN, and slightly more-accurate cell volumes\nthan r$^2$SCAN. The average absolute errors in predicted formation enthalpies\nare found to decrease by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 from the GGA level to the\nmeta-GGA level. Smaller decreases in error are observed for decomposition\nenthalpies. For formation enthalpies r$^2$SCAN improves over SCAN for\nintermetallic systems. For a few classes of systems -- transition metals,\nintermetallics, weakly-bound solids, and enthalpies of decomposition into\ncompounds -- GGAs are comparable to meta-GGAs. In total, r$^2$SCAN and\nr$^2$SCAN+rVV10 can be recommended as stable, general-purpose meta-GGAs for\nmaterials discovery.",

Here, we report the\nfirst automated discovery of complex materials through inverse molecular design\nwhich is informed by meso-scale target features and process figures-of-merit.\nWe have entered the new discovery regime by computationally generating and\nvalidating hundreds of polymer candidates designed for application in\npost-combustion carbon dioxide filtration. Specifically, we have validated each\ndiscovery step, from training dataset creation, via graph-based generative\ndesign of optimized monomer units, to molecular dynamics simulation of gas\npermeation through the polymer membranes. For the latter, we have devised a\nRepresentative Elementary Volume (REV) enabling permeability simulations at\nabout 1,000x the volume of an individual, AI-generated monomer, obtaining\nquantitative agreement. The discovery-to-validation time per polymer candidate\nis on the order of 100 hours in a standard computing environment, offering a\ncomputational screening alternative prior to lab validation.",

    "summary": "Data-driven machine learning methods have the potential to dramatically\naccelerate the rate of materials design over conventional human-guided\napproaches. These methods would help identify or, in the case of generative\nmodels, even create novel crystal structures of materials with a set of\nspecified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the\nlaboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in\ndeveloping suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the\nmachine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations\nused in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations\nthat are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while\nremaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing\nchallenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking\nexisting non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and\ndeveloping an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through\ngradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be\ncoupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials\nwithin the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian\nspace. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach\nusing atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional\nvariational autoencoders as the generative model. We are able to successfully\ngenerate novel and valid atomic structures of sub-nanometer Pt nanoparticles as\na proof of concept. Furthermore, this method can be readily extended to any\nsuitable structural representation, thereby providing a powerful, generalizable\nframework towards structure-based generation.",

    "summary": "Liquid metals (LM) are embedded in an elastomer matrix to obtain soft\ncomposites with unique thermal, dielectric, and mechanical properties. They\nhave applications in soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and wearable\nelectronics. By linking the structure to the properties of these materials, it\nis possible to perform material design rationally. Liquid-metal embedded\nelastomers (LMEEs) have been designed for targeted electro-thermo-mechanical\nproperties by semi-supervised learning of structure-property (SP) links in a\nvariational autoencoder network (VAE). The design parameters are the\nmicrostructural descriptors that are physically meaningful and have affine\nrelationships with the synthetization of the studied particulate composite. The\nmachine learning (ML) model is trained on a generated dataset of\nmicrostructural descriptors with their multifunctional property quantities as\ntheir labels. Sobol sequence is used for in-silico Design of Experiment (DoE)\nby sampling the design space to generate a comprehensive dataset of 3D\nmicrostructure realizations via a packing algorithm. The mechanical responses\nof the generated microstructures are simulated using a previously developed\nFinite Element (FE) model, considering the surface tension induced by LM\ninclusions, while the linear thermal and dielectric constants are homogenized\nwith the help of our in-house Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) package. Following\nthe training by minimization of an appropriate loss function, the VAE encoder\nacts as the surrogate of numerical solvers of the multifunctional\nhomogenizations, and its decoder is used for the material design. Our results\nindicate the satisfactory performance of the surrogate model and the inverse\ncalculator with respect to high-fidelity numerical simulations validated with\nLMEE experimental results.",

Whether\nand how they lead to gapless topological states is an outstanding question, and\na framework that allows for determining novel phases and identifying new\nmaterials is in pressing need. Here we advance a general approach, in which\nstrong correlations cooperate with crystalline symmetry to drive gapless\ntopological states. We test this materials design principle by exploring Kondo\nlattice models and materials whose space group symmetries may promote different\nkinds of electronic degeneracies, with a particular focus on square-net\nsystems. Weyl-Kondo nodal-line semimetals -- with nodes pinned to the Fermi\nenergy -- are identified. We describe how this approach can be applied to\ndiscover strongly correlated topological semimetals, identify three heavy\nfermion compounds as new candidates, provide first direct experimental evidence\nfor our prediction in Ce$_2$Au$_3$In$_5$, and discuss how our approach may lead\nto many more. Our findings illustrate the potential of the proposed materials\ndesign principle to guide the search for new topological metals in a broad\nrange of strongly correlated systems.",

Such\nalgorithms have revolutionzed material design and performance of\nphoto-voltaics, electronic structure calculations of ground and excited states\nof correlated matter, computation of force-fields and potential energy surfaces\ninforming chemical reaction dynamics, reactivity inspired rational strategies\nof drug designing and even classification of phases of matter with accurate\nidentification of emergent criticality.

We shall not only present a brief overview of the well-known techniques\nbut also highlight their learning strategies using statistical physical\ninsight.

Six\ndifferent datasets with/out non-charge-neutral or balanced electronegativity\nsamples are used to benchmark the performances and uncover the generation\nbiases of modern transformer models for the generative design of materials\ncompositions. Our extensive experiments showed that the causal language models\nbased materials transformers can generate chemically valid materials\ncompositions with as high as 97.54\\% to be charge neutral and 91.40\\% to be\nelectronegativity balanced, which has more than 6 times higher enrichment\ncompared to a baseline pseudo-random sampling algorithm.

    "summary": "We introduce a new method for inverse design of nanophotonic devices which\nguarantees that resulting designs satisfy strict length scale constraints -\nincluding minimum width and spacing constraints required by commercial\nsemiconductor foundries. The method adopts several concepts from machine\nlearning to transform the problem of topology optimization with strict length\nscale constraints to an unconstrained stochastic gradient optimization problem.\nSpecifically, we introduce a conditional generator for feasible designs and\nadopt a straight-through estimator for backpropagation of gradients to a latent\ndesign. We demonstrate the performance and reliability of our method by\ndesigning several common integrated photonic components.",

    "summary": "Recognition of structure prototypes from tremendous known inorganic crystal\nstructures has been an important subject beneficial for material science\nresearch and new materials design. The existing databases of inorganic crystal\nstructure prototypes were mostly constructed by classifying materials in terms\nof the crystallographic space group information. Herein, we employed a distinct\nstrategy to construct the inorganic crystal structure prototype database,\nrelying on the classification of materials in terms of local atomic\nenvironments (LAE) accompanied by unsupervised machine learning method.\nSpecifically, we adopted a hierarchical clustering approach onto all\nexperimentally known inorganic crystal structures data to identify structure\nprototypes. The criterion for hierarchical clustering is the LAE represented by\nthe state-of-the-art structure fingerprints of the improved bond-orientational\norder parameters and the smooth overlap of atomic positions. This allows us to\nbuild up a LAE-based Inorganic Crystal Structure Prototype Database (LAE-ICSPD)\ncontaining 15,613 structure prototypes with defined stoichiometries. In\naddition, we have developed a Structure Prototype Generator Infrastructure\n(SPGI) package, which is a useful toolkit for structure prototype generation.\nOur developed SPGI toolkit and LAE-ICSPD are beneficial for investigating\ninorganic materials in a global way as well as accelerating materials discovery\nprocess in the data-driven mode.",

    "summary": "The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) occurs in solids with broken inversion\nsymmetry and refers to DC current generation due to uniform illumination,\nwithout the need of heterostructures or interfaces, a feature that is distinct\nfrom the traditional photovoltaic effect. Its existence has been demonstrated\nalmost 50 years ago, but predictive theories only appeared in the last ten\nyears, allowing for the identification of different mechanisms and the\ndetermination of their relative importance in real materials. It is now\ngenerally accepted that there is an intrinsic mechanism that is insensitive to\nscattering, called shift current, where first-principles calculations can now\ngive highly accurate predictions. Another important but more extrinsic\nmechanism, called ballistic current, is also attracting a lot of attention, but\ndue to the complicated scattering processes, its numerical calculation for real\nmaterials is only made possible quite recently. In addition, an intrinsic\nballistic current, usually referred to as injection current, will appear under\ncircularly-polarized light and has wide application in experiments. In this\narticle, experiments that are pertinent to the theory development are reviewed,\nand a significant portion is devoted to discussing the recent progress in the\ntheories of BPVE and their numerical implementations. As a demonstration of the\ncapability of the newly developed theories, a brief review of the materials\ndesign strategies enabled by the theory development is given. Finally,\nremaining questions in the BPVE field and possible future directions are\ndiscussed to inspire further investigations.",

    "summary": "Deep graph learning has achieved remarkable progresses in both business and\nscientific areas ranging from finance and e-commerce, to drug and advanced\nmaterial discovery. Despite these progresses, how to ensure various deep graph\nlearning algorithms behave in a socially responsible manner and meet regulatory\ncompliance requirements becomes an emerging problem, especially in\nrisk-sensitive domains. Trustworthy graph learning (TwGL) aims to solve the\nabove problems from a technical viewpoint. In contrast to conventional graph\nlearning research which mainly cares about model performance, TwGL considers\nvarious reliability and safety aspects of the graph learning framework\nincluding but not limited to robustness, explainability, and privacy. In this\nsurvey, we provide a comprehensive review of recent leading approaches in the\nTwGL field from three dimensions, namely, reliability, explainability, and\nprivacy protection. We give a general categorization for existing work and\nreview typical work for each category. To give further insights for TwGL\nresearch, we provide a unified view to inspect previous works and build the\nconnection between them. We also point out some important open problems\nremaining to be solved in the future developments of TwGL.",

    "summary": "Transformer models have been developed in molecular science with excellent\nperformance in applications including quantitative structure-activity\nrelationship (QSAR) and virtual screening (VS). Compared with other types of\nmodels, however, they are large, which results in a high hardware requirement\nto abridge time for both training and inference processes. In this work,\ncross-layer parameter sharing (CLPS), and knowledge distillation (KD) are used\nto reduce the sizes of transformers in molecular science. Both methods not only\nhave competitive QSAR predictive performance as compared to the original BERT\nmodel, but also are more parameter efficient. Furthermore, by integrating CLPS\nand KD into a two-state chemical network, we introduce a new deep lite chemical\ntransformer model, DeLiCaTe. DeLiCaTe captures general-domains as well as\ntask-specific knowledge, which lead to a 4x faster rate of both training and\ninference due to a 10- and 3-times reduction of the number of parameters and\nlayers, respectively. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable performance in QSAR and\nVS modeling. Moreover, we anticipate that the model compression strategy\nprovides a pathway to the creation of effective generative transformer models\nfor organic drug and material design.",

    "summary": "Large-scale electrification is vital to addressing the climate crisis, but\nseveral scientific and technological challenges remain to fully electrify both\nthe chemical industry and transportation. In both of these areas, new\nelectrochemical materials will be critical, but their development currently\nrelies heavily on human-time-intensive experimental trial and error and\ncomputationally expensive first-principles, meso-scale and continuum\nsimulations. We present an automated workflow, AutoMat, that accelerates these\ncomputational steps by introducing both automated input generation and\nmanagement of simulations across scales from first principles to continuum\ndevice modeling. Furthermore, we show how to seamlessly integrate\nmulti-fidelity predictions such as machine learning surrogates or automated\nrobotic experiments \"in-the-loop\". The automated framework is implemented with\ndesign space search techniques to dramatically accelerate the overall materials\ndiscovery pipeline by implicitly learning design features that optimize device\nperformance across several metrics. We discuss the benefits of AutoMat using\nexamples in electrocatalysis and energy storage and highlight lessons learned.",

    "summary": "Variable-density cellular structures can overcome connectivity and\nmanufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly\nthose represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such\ncellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past\nwork addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume\nfraction of single-type unit cells but ignores the effects of unit cell\ngeometry on properties, or considers the geometry-property relation but builds\nthis relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more\nprincipled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a\nconditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative\nAdversarial Network (IH-GAN). It learns the conditional distribution of unit\ncell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from\nproperties to geometries. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using\nthe implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries.\nResults show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy\ngiven material properties with high accuracy ($R^2$-scores between target\nproperties and properties of generated unit cells $>98\\%$) and 2) improve the\noptimized structural performance over the conventional variable-density\nsingle-type structure. In the minimum compliance example, our IH-GAN generated\nstructure achieves a $79.7\\%$ reduction in concentrated stress and an extra\n$3.03\\%$ reduction in displacement. In the target deformation examples, our\nIH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by $86.4\\%$ and\n$79.6\\%$ for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the\nconnectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer\nblending.",

    "summary": "Deep Generative Machine Learning Models have been growing in popularity\nacross the design community thanks to their ability to learn and mimic complex\ndata distributions. While early works are promising, further advancement will\ndepend on addressing several critical considerations such as design quality,\nfeasibility, novelty, and targeted inverse design. We propose the Design Target\nAchievement Index (DTAI), a differentiable, tunable metric that scores a\ndesign's ability to achieve designer-specified minimum performance targets. We\ndemonstrate that DTAI can drastically improve the performance of generated\ndesigns when directly used as a training loss in Deep Generative Models. We\napply the DTAI loss to a Performance-Augmented Diverse GAN (PaDGAN) and\ndemonstrate superior generative performance compared to a set of baseline Deep\nGenerative Models including a Multi-Objective PaDGAN and specialized tabular\ngeneration algorithms like the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN). We further\nenhance PaDGAN with an auxiliary feasibility classifier to encourage feasible\ndesigns. To evaluate methods, we propose a comprehensive set of evaluation\nmetrics for generative methods that focus on feasibility, diversity, and\nsatisfaction of design performance targets. Methods are tested on a challenging\nbenchmarking problem: the FRAMED bicycle frame design dataset featuring\nmixed-datatype parametric data, heavily skewed and multimodal distributions,\nand ten competing performance objectives.",

    "summary": "Materials property predictions have improved from advances in machine\nlearning algorithms, delivering materials discoveries and novel insights\nthrough data-driven models of structure-property relationships. Nearly all\navailable models rely on featurization of materials composition, however,\nwhether the exclusive use of structural knowledge in such models has the\ncapacity to make comparable predictions remains unknown. Here we employ a deep\nneural network model to decode structure-property relationships in crystalline\nmaterials without explicitly considering chemical compositions. The focus is on\nclassification of crystal systems, mechanical elasticity, electronic band gap,\nand phase stability. Our model utilizes a three-dimensional (3D) momentum space\nrepresentation of structure from elastic x-ray scattering theory that exhibits\nrotation and permutation invariance. We perform novel ablation studies to help\ninterpret the model performance by perturbing the physically meaningful input\nfeatures (i.e., the diffraction patterns) instead of tuning the architecture of\nthe learning model as in conventional ablation methods. We find that the\nspatial symmetry of the 3D diffraction patterns, which reflects crystalline\nsymmetry operations, is more important than the diffraction intensities\ncontained within for the model to make a successful classification. Our work\nshowcases the potential of using statistical learning models to help understand\nmaterials physics, rather than performing predictive and generative tasks as in\nmost materials informatics research. We also argue that learning the crystal\nstructure genome in a chemistry-agnostic manner demonstrates that some crystal\nstructures inherently host high propensities for optimal materials properties,\nwhich enables the decoupling of structure and composition for future codesign\nof multifunctionality.",

A new class of metamaterials is proposed,\nwhose mechanical properties rely on deformation-induced transitions in\nnodal-topology by formation of internal self-contact. The universal nature of\nthe principle presented, is demonstrated for tension, compression, shear and\ntorsion. In particular, it is shown that by frustration of soft deformation\nmodes, large highly non-linear stiffening effects can be generated.

Neural network potentials (NNPs)\nhave been shown to be particularly effective in conducting atomistic\nsimulations for such purposes. However, existing NNPs are generally designed\nfor narrow target materials, making them unsuitable for broader applications in\nmaterial discovery. To overcome this issue, we have developed a universal NNP\ncalled PreFerred Potential (PFP), which is able to handle any combination of 45\nelements. Particular emphasis is placed on the datasets, which include a\ndiverse set of virtual structures used to attain the universality. We\ndemonstrated the applicability of PFP in selected domains: lithium diffusion in\nLiFeSO${}_4$F, molecular adsorption in metal-organic frameworks, an\norder-disorder transition of Cu-Au alloys, and material discovery for a\nFischer-Tropsch catalyst. They showcase the power of PFP, and this technology\nprovides a highly useful tool for material discovery.",

In the\npresent paper, we addresse this issue and introduce a generic multi-task\nlearning-based optimization approach.

Basically, the approach consists of an optimization\nalgorithm that interacts with a machine learning model that combines multi-task\nlearning with siamese neural networks. The resulting model (1) relates\nmicrostructures and properties, (2) estimates the likelihood of a\nmicrostructure of being producible, and (3) performs a distance preserving\nmicrostructure feature extraction in order to generate a lower dimensional\nlatent feature space to enable efficient optimization.

Successfully adapting\ngenerative Machine Learning to design engineering may enable such automated\ndesign synthesis and is a research subject of great importance. We present a\nreview and analysis of Deep Generative Machine Learning models in engineering\ndesign. Deep Generative Models (DGMs) typically leverage deep networks to learn\nfrom an input dataset and synthesize new designs. Recently, DGMs such as\nfeedforward Neural Networks (NNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs), and certain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nframeworks have shown promising results in design applications like structural\noptimization, materials design, and shape synthesis. The prevalence of DGMs in\nengineering design has skyrocketed since 2016. Anticipating continued growth,\nwe conduct a review of recent advances to benefit researchers interested in\nDGMs for design. We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms,\ndatasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current\nliterature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new\ntechniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related\ndomain, or directly supported the development of DGMs through datasets or\nauxiliary methods. We further identify key challenges and limitations currently\nseen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity, handling\nconstraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance\nsimultaneously. In our discussion, we identify possible solution pathways as\nkey areas on which to target future work.",

    "summary": "Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing\nchallenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because\nstable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible\nperiodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy\nminimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the\nstructure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between\ndifferent atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and\noften lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational\nAutoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material\nstability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the\ndecoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic\ncoordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy\nbonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes\ninteractions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation,\nrotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in\nthree tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid,\ndiverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a\nspecific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation\nmetrics for the broader machine learning community.",

    "summary": "The inverse approach is computationally efficient in aerodynamic design as\nthe desired target performance distribution is prespecified. However, it has\nsome significant limitations that prevent it from achieving full efficiency.\nFirst, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target\ndistribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to\nclarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional\nproblems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due\nto parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic\ndistribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical\npredictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric\nconstraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization\nframework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational\nautoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target\ndistribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from\nthe generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution\noptimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed\nframework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve\naccuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through\naerodynamic shape optimizations of the wind turbine airfoil. Their results show\nthat this framework is accurate, efficient, and flexible to be applied to other\ninverse design engineering applications.",

The determination of\nphase diagrams is thus one of the central tasks in materials science. When\nexploring new materials for which the phase diagram is unknown,\nexperimentalists often try to determine the key experiments that should be\nperformed by referencing known phase diagrams of similar systems. To enhance\nthis practical strategy, we attempted to estimate unknown phase diagrams based\non known phase diagrams using a machine learning-based classification approach.\nAs a proof of concept, we focused on predicting the number of coexisting phases\nacross the 800 K isothermal section of each of the 10 ternaries of the\nAl-Cu-Mg-Si-Zn system from the other 9 sections. To increase the prediction\naccuracy, we introduced new descriptors generated from the thermodynamic\nproperties of the elements and CALPHAD extrapolations from lower-order systems.\nUsing the random forest method, the presence of single-, two-, and three-phase\ndomains was predicted with an average accuracy of 84% across all 10 considered\nsections with a standard deviation of 11%.

    "summary": "The braking performance of the brake system is a target performance that must\nbe considered for vehicle development. Apparent piston travel (APT) and drag\ntorque are the most representative factors for evaluating braking performance.\nIn particular, as the two performance factors have a conflicting relationship\nwith each other, a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) approach is\nrequired for brake design. However, the computational cost of MDO increases as\nthe number of disciplines increases. Recent studies on inverse design that use\ndeep learning (DL) have established the possibility of instantly generating an\noptimal design that can satisfy the target performance without implementing an\niterative optimization process. This study proposes a DL-based\nmultidisciplinary inverse design (MID) that simultaneously satisfies multiple\ntargets, such as the APT and drag torque of the brake system. Results show that\nthe proposed inverse design can find the optimal design more efficiently\ncompared with the conventional optimization methods, such as backpropagation\nand sequential quadratic programming. The MID achieved a similar performance to\nthe single-disciplinary inverse design in terms of accuracy and computational\ncost. A novel design was derived on the basis of results, and the same\nperformance was satisfied as that of the existing design.",

    "summary": "Topology optimization of modular structures and mechanisms enables balancing\nthe performance of automatically-generated individualized designs, as required\nby Industry 4.0, with enhanced sustainability by means of component reuse. For\noptimal modular design, two key questions must be answered: (i) what should the\ntopology of individual modules be like and (ii) how should modules be arranged\nat the product scale? We address these challenges by proposing a bi-level\nsequential strategy that combines free material design, clustering techniques,\nand topology optimization. First, using free material optimization enhanced\nwith post-processing for checkerboard suppression, we determine the\ndistribution of elasticity tensors at the product scale. To extract the\nsought-after modular arrangement, we partition the obtained elasticity tensors\nwith a novel deterministic clustering algorithm and interpret its outputs\nwithin Wang tiling formalism. Finally, we design interiors of individual\nmodules by solving a single-scale topology optimization problem with the design\nspace reduced by modular mapping, conveniently starting from an initial guess\nprovided by free material optimization. We illustrate these developments with\nthree benchmarks first, covering compliance minimization of modular structures,\nand, for the first time, the design of non-periodic compliant modular\nmechanisms. Furthermore, we design a set of modules reusable in an inverter and\nin gripper mechanisms, which ultimately pave the way towards the rational\ndesign of modular architectured (meta)materials.",

In this\nrespect, this study proposes a molecular graph generative model based on the\nautoencoder for de novo design. The performance of molecular graph conditional\nvariational autoencoder (MGCVAE) for generating molecules having specific\ndesired properties is investigated by comparing it to molecular graph\nvariational autoencoder (MGVAE). Furthermore, multi-objective optimization for\nMGCVAE was applied to satisfy two selected properties simultaneously. In this\nstudy, two physical properties -- logP and molar refractivity -- were used as\noptimization targets for the purpose of designing de novo molecules, especially\nin drug discovery. As a result, it was confirmed that among generated\nmolecules, 25.89% optimized molecules were generated in MGCVAE compared to\n0.66% in MGVAE. Hence, it demonstrates that MGCVAE effectively produced\ndrug-like molecules with two target properties. The results of this study\nsuggest that these graph-based data-driven models are one of the effective\nmethods of designing new molecules that fulfill various physical properties,\nsuch as drug discovery.",

In general, this last requirement is\nnot automatically satisfied by the most efficient structural descriptors,\nnamely the representation is not directly invertible. Such drawback severely\nlimits our freedom of choice in selecting the most appropriate descriptors for\nthe problem, and thus our flexibility to construct generative models. In this\nwork, we present a general optimization method capable of inverting any local\nmany-body descriptor of the chemical environment, back to a cartesian\nrepresentation. The algorithm is then implemented together with the bispectrum\nrepresentation of the local structure and demonstrated for a number of\nmolecules. The scheme presented here, thus, represents a general approach to\nthe inversion of structural descriptors, enabling the construction of efficient\nstructural generative models.",

Our\nmethodology is guided by constraints on repeated simulation and an easily\nintegrated metric, which we propose expresses the relative ill-posedness of any\nAEM design problem. We show that as the problem becomes increasingly ill-posed,\nthe neural adjoint with boundary loss (NA) generates better solutions faster,\nregardless of simulation constraints. On simpler AEM design tasks, direct\nneural networks (NN) fare better when simulations are limited, while geometries\npredicted by mixture density networks (MDN) and conditional variational\nauto-encoders (VAE) can improve with continued sampling and re-simulation.",

    "summary": "Designing new industrial materials with desired properties can be very\nexpensive and time consuming. The main difficulty is to generate compounds that\ncorrespond to realistic materials. Indeed, the description of compounds as\nvectors of components' proportions is characterized by discrete features and a\nsevere sparsity. Furthermore, traditional generative model validation processes\nas visual verification, FID and Inception scores are tailored for images and\ncannot then be used as such in this context. To tackle these issues, we develop\nan original Binded-VAE model dedicated to the generation of discrete datasets\nwith high sparsity. We validate the model with novel metrics adapted to the\nproblem of compounds generation. We show on a real issue of rubber compound\ndesign that the proposed approach outperforms the standard generative models\nwhich opens new perspectives for material design optimization.",

However, state-of-the-art\ngenerative models tend to be limited to a specific composition or crystal\nstructure. Herein, we present a framework capable of general inverse design\n(not limited to a given set of elements or crystal structures), featuring a\ngeneralized invertible representation that encodes crystals in both real and\nreciprocal space, and a property-structured latent space from a variational\nautoencoder (VAE). In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new\ncrystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE)\npower factor, and combinations thereof. These generated crystals, absent in the\ntraining database, are validated by first-principles calculations. The success\nrates (number of first-principles-validated target-satisfying crystals/number\nof designed crystals) ranges between 7.1% and 38.9%. These results represent a\nsignificant step toward property-driven general inverse design using generative\nmodels, although practical challenges remain when coupled with experimental\nsynthesis.",

    "summary": "Data driven generative machine learning models have recently emerged as one\nof the most promising approaches for new materials discovery. While the\ngenerator models can generate millions of candidates, it is critical to train\nfast and accurate machine learning models to filter out stable, synthesizable\nmaterials with desired properties. However, such efforts to build supervised\nregression or classification screening models have been severely hindered by\nthe lack of unstable or unsynthesizable samples, which usually are not\ncollected and deposited in materials databases such as ICSD and Materials\nProject (MP). At the same time, there are a significant amount of unlabelled\ndata available in these databases. Here we propose a semi-supervised deep\nneural network (TSDNN) model for high-performance formation energy and\nsynthesizability prediction, which is achieved via its unique teacher-student\ndual network architecture and its effective exploitation of the large amount of\nunlabeled data. For formation energy based stability screening, our\nsemi-supervised classifier achieves an absolute 10.3\\% accuracy improvement\ncompared to the baseline CGCNN regression model. For synthesizability\nprediction, our model significantly increases the baseline PU learning's true\npositive rate from 87.9\\% to 97.9\\% using 1/49 model parameters.\n  To further prove the effectiveness of our models, we combined our\nTSDNN-energy and TSDNN-synthesizability models with our CubicGAN generator to\ndiscover novel stable cubic structures. Out of 1000 recommended candidate\nsamples by our models, 512 of them have negative formation energies as\nvalidated by our DFT formation energy calculations. Our experimental results\nshow that our semi-supervised deep neural networks can significantly improve\nthe screening accuracy in large-scale generative materials design.",

To assist in the selection of suitable substrates for the\nsynthesis of as-yet hypothetical 2D materials, we have developed an open-source\nhigh-throughput workflow package, $Hetero2d$, that searches for low-lattice\nmismatched substrate surfaces for any 2D material and determines the stability\nof these 2D-substrate heterostructures using density functional theory (DFT)\nsimulations. $Hetero2d$ automates the generation of 2D-substrate\nheterostructures, the creation of DFT input files, the submission and\nmonitoring of computational jobs on supercomputing facilities, and the storage\nof relevant parameters alongside the post-processed results in a MongoDB\ndatabase. We demonstrate the capability of $Hetero2d$ in identifying stable\n2D-substrate heterostructures for four 2D materials, namely $2H$-MoS$_2$, $1T$-\nand $2H$-NbO$_2$, and hexagonal-ZnTe, considering 50 cubic elemental\nsubstrates. We find Cu, Hf, Mn, Nd, Ni, Pd, Re, Rh, Sc, Ta, Ti, V, W, Y, and Zr\nsubstrates sufficiently stabilize the formation energies of these 2D materials,\nwith binding energies in the range of ~0.1 - 0.6 eV/atom. Upon examining the\n$z$-separation, the charge transfer, and the electronic density of states at\nthe 2D-substrate interface, we find a covalent type bonding at the interface\nwhich suggests that these substrates can be used as contact materials for the\n2D materials. $Hetero2d$ (https://github.com/cmdlab/Hetero2d) is available on\nGitHub as an open-source package under the GNU license.",

The downstream utility of generative models for the inverse design of\nnovel functional compounds depends on their ability to learn a training\ndistribution of molecules. The most simple example is a language model that\ntakes the form of a recurrent neural network and generates molecules using a\nstring representation. More sophisticated are graph generative models, which\nsequentially construct molecular graphs and typically achieve state of the art\nresults. However, recent work has shown that language models are more capable\nthan once thought, particularly in the low data regime. In this work, we\ninvestigate the capacity of simple language models to learn distributions of\nmolecules. For this purpose, we introduce several challenging generative\nmodeling tasks by compiling especially complex distributions of molecules. On\neach task, we evaluate the ability of language models as compared with two\nwidely used graph generative models. The results demonstrate that language\nmodels are powerful generative models, capable of adeptly learning complex\nmolecular distributions -- and yield better performance than the graph models.\nLanguage models can accurately generate: distributions of the highest scoring\npenalized LogP molecules in ZINC15, multi-modal molecular distributions as well\nas the largest molecules in PubChem.",

Such textures are abundantly\nobserved in ferromagnets (FMs); however, their antiferromagnetic (AFM)\ncounterparts are expected to be even more relevant for device applications, as\nthey promise ultra-fast, deflection-free dynamics whilst being robust against\nexternal fields. Unfortunately, they have remained elusive, hence identifying\nmaterials hosting such textures is key to developing this technology. Here, we\npresent comprehensive micromagnetic and analytical models investigating\ntopological textures in the broad material class of A-type antiferromagnets,\nspecifically focusing on the prototypical case of $\\alpha \\text{-Fe}_2\n\\text{O}_3$,an emerging candidate for AFM spintronics. By exploiting a symmetry\nbreaking interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI), it is possible\nto stabilize a wide topological family, including AFM (anti)merons and bimerons\nand the hitherto undiscovered AFM skyrmions. Whilst iDMI enforces homochirality\nand improves the stability of these textures, the widely tunable anisotropy and\nexchange interactions enable unprecedented control of their core dimensions. We\nthen present a unifying framework to model the scaling of texture sizes based\non a simple dimensional analysis.

However, currently, the computationally expensive\nfirst principle calculation based crystal structure prediction algorithms are\napplicable to relatively small systems and are out of reach of most materials\nresearchers due to the requirement of high computing resources or the software\ncost related to ab initio code such as VASP. Several computational teams have\nused an element substitution approach for generating or predicting new\nstructures, but usually in an ad hoc way. Here we develop a template based\ncrystal structure prediction algorithm (TCSP) and its companion web server,\nwhich makes this tool to be accessible to all materials researchers. Our\nalgorithm uses elemental/chemical similarity and oxidation states to guide the\nselection of template structures and then rank them based on the substitution\ncompatibility and can return multiple predictions with ranking scores in a few\nminutes. Benchmark study on the ~98,290 formulas of the Materials Project\ndatabase using leave-one-out evaluation shows that our algorithm can achieve\nhigh accuracy (for 13,145 target structures, TCSP predicted their structures\nwith RMSD < 0.1) for a large portion of the formulas. We have also used TCSP to\ndiscover new materials of the Ga-B-N system showing its potential for\nhigh-throughput materials discovery.

In this work, we show that by\na sequential design of experiment scheme, the process of generating and\nlearning from the data can be combined to discover the relevant sections of the\nparameter space. Our example is the energy of grain boundaries as a function of\ntheir geometric degrees of freedom, calculated via atomistic simulations. The\nsampling of this grain boundary energy space, or even subspaces of it,\nrepresents a challenge due to the presence of deep cusps of the energy, which\nare located at irregular intervals of the geometric parameters. Existing\napproaches to sample grain boundary energy subspaces therefore either need a\nhuge amount of datapoints or a~priori knowledge of the positions of these\ncusps. We combine statistical methods with atomistic simulations and a\nsequential sampling technique and compare this strategy to a regular sampling\ntechnique.

    "summary": "Silicon (Si) is one of the most abundant elements on Earth, and it is the\nmost important and widely used semiconductor, constituting the basis of modern\nelectronic devices. Despite extensive study, some properties of Si remain\nelusive. For example, the behaviour of Si under high pressure, in particular at\nthe ultra-high strain rates characteristic of dynamic compression, has been a\nmatter of debate for decades. A detailed understanding of how Si deforms is\ncrucial for a variety of fields, ranging from planetary science to materials\ndesign. Simulations suggest that in Si the shear stress generated during shock\ncompression is released inelastically, i.e., via a high-pressure phase\ntransition, challenging the classical picture of relaxation via defect-mediated\nplasticity. However, experiments at the short timescales characteristic of\nshock compression are challenging, and direct evidence supporting either\ndeformation mechanism remain elusive. Here, we use sub-picosecond,\nhighly-monochromatic x-ray diffraction to study (100)-oriented single-crystal\nSi under laser-driven shock compression. We provide the first unambiguous,\ntime-resolved picture of Si deformation at ultra-high strain rates,\ndemonstrating the predicted inelastic shear release. Our results resolve the\nlongstanding controversy on silicon deformation under dynamic compression, and\nprovide direct proof of strain rate-dependent deformation mechanisms in a\nnon-metallic system, which is key for the study of planetary-relevant\nmaterials.",

Recent development of large materials\ndatabases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in\nparticular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely\nleveraged synthetic data enabled by high quality forward models as well as by\ngenerative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level\noverview of deep-learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent\ndevelopments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging,\nspectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we\ndiscuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical\nmodeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly\navailable software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of\nrecent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field\nand a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas\nfor DL methods in materials science.

In this work, a general algorithm is developed to\nreconstruct a three-dimensional microstructure from given descriptors. Based on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) micrographs, this reconstruction algorithm allows valuable\ninsight through spatial visualization of the microstructure and in silico\nstudies of structure-property linkages. The formulation ensures computational\nefficiency by casting microstructure reconstruction as a gradient-based\noptimization problem. Herein, the descriptors can be chosen freely, such as\nspatial correlations or Gram matrices, as long as they are differentiable with\nrespect to the microstructure. Because real microstructure samples are commonly\navailable as 2D microscopy images only, the desired descriptors for the\nreconstruction process are prescribed on orthogonal 2D slices. This adds a\nsource of noise, which is handled in a new, superior and interpretable manner.\nThe efficiency and applicability of this formulation is demonstrated by various\nnumerical experiments.",

Here, we introduce surrogate- and invariance-boosted contrastive\nlearning (SIB-CL), a deep learning framework which incorporates three\n``inexpensive'' and easily obtainable auxiliary information sources to overcome\ndata scarcity. Specifically, these are: 1)~abundant unlabeled data, 2)~prior\nknowledge of symmetries or invariances and 3)~surrogate data obtained at\nnear-zero cost. We demonstrate SIB-CL's effectiveness and generality on various\nscientific problems, e.g., predicting the density-of-states of 2D photonic\ncrystals and solving the 3D time-independent Schrodinger equation. SIB-CL\nconsistently results in orders of magnitude reduction in the number of labels\nneeded to achieve the same network accuracies.",

    "summary": "Recently many efforts have been devoted to applying graph neural networks\n(GNNs) to molecular property prediction which is a fundamental task for\ncomputational drug and material discovery. One of major obstacles to hinder the\nsuccessful prediction of molecule property by GNNs is the scarcity of labeled\ndata. Though graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have achieved\nextraordinary performance with insufficient labeled data, most focused on\ndesigning data augmentation schemes for general graphs. However, the\nfundamental property of a molecule could be altered with the augmentation\nmethod (like random perturbation) on molecular graphs. Whereas, the critical\ngeometric information of molecules remains rarely explored under the current\nGNN and GCL architectures. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive\nlearning method utilizing the geometry of the molecule across 2D and 3D views,\nwhich is named GeomGCL. Specifically, we first devise a dual-view geometric\nmessage passing network (GeomMPNN) to adaptively leverage the rich information\nof both 2D and 3D graphs of a molecule. The incorporation of geometric\nproperties at different levels can greatly facilitate the molecular\nrepresentation learning. Then a novel geometric graph contrastive scheme is\ndesigned to make both geometric views collaboratively supervise each other to\nimprove the generalization ability of GeomMPNN. We evaluate GeomGCL on various\ndownstream property prediction tasks via a finetune process. Experimental\nresults on seven real-life molecular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed GeomGCL against state-of-the-art baselines.",
