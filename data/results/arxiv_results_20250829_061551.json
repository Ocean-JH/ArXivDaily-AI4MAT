    "summary": "We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure\ngeneration that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend\nof architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,\nCrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive\nbias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent\nsystem. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a\nbalanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,\nNovel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including\nFlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%\nunique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,\ndemonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than\ncomplexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited\nscientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform\nsophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.",
