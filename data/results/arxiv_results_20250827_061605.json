    "summary": "Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly\ntunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult\nbecause of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to\nbehaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.\n(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that\ncaptures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and\nmachine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000\nparameterized MetaDSL programs together with their\nderivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated\nelastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core\ncapabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure\nreconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We\nestablish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and\ndeploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies\nshow that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design\nand understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design in manufacturing,\nenabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and processes.\nHowever, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic\nmanufacturing settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design\nspaces, and complex constraints. This perspective proposes an integrated\nframework built on three complementary pillars: domain knowledge to establish\nphysically meaningful objectives and constraints while removing variables with\nlimited relevance, physics-informed machine learning to enhance generalization\nunder limited or biased data, and large language model-based interfaces to\nsupport intuitive, human-centered interaction. Using injection molding as an\nillustrative example, we demonstrate how these components can operate in\npractice and conclude by highlighting key challenges for applying such\napproaches in realistic manufacturing environments.",

    "summary": "We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure\ngeneration that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend\nof architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,\nCrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive\nbias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent\nsystem. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a\nbalanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,\nNovel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including\nFlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%\nunique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,\ndemonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than\ncomplexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited\nscientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform\nsophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.",
