    "summary": "In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical space through generative models and surrogate screening. Yet current AI workflows optimize performance first, deferring sustainability to post synthesis assessment. This creates inefficiency by the time environmental burdens are quantified, resources have been invested in potentially unsustainable solutions. The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges. Realizing ML-LCA demands coordinated advances in data infrastructure, ex-ante assessment methodologies, multi-objective optimization, and regulatory alignment enabling the discovery of materials that are sustainable by design rather than by chance.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI Scientist system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.",

    "summary": "Electrides are exotic compounds in which excess electrons occupy interstitial regions of the crystal lattice and serve as anions, exhibiting exceptional properties such as low work function, high electron mobility, and strong catalytic activity. Although they show promise for diverse applications, identifying new electrides remains challenging due to the difficulty of achieving energetically favorable electron localization in crystal cavities. Here, we present an accelerated materials discovery framework that combines physical principles, diffusion-based materials generation with hierarchical thermodynamic and electronic structure screening. Using this workflow, we systematically explored 1,510 binary and 6,654 ternary chemical compositions containing excess valence electrons from electropositive alkaline, alkaline-earth, and early transition metals, and then filtered them with a high throughput validation on both thermodynamical stability and electronic structure analysis. As a result, we have identified 264 new electron rich compounds within 0.05 eV/atom above the convex hull at the density functional theory (DFT) level, including 13 thermodynamically stable electrides. Our approach demonstrates a generalizable strategy for targeted materials discovery in a vast chemical space.",

    "summary": "Superconducting materials are of significant technological relevance for a broad range of applications, and intense research efforts aim at enhancing the critical temperature $T_{c}$. Intriguingly, while numerous studies have explored different computational and machine-learning routes to predict $T_{c}$, the fundamental role of the critical magnetic field has so far been overlooked. Here we open a new frontier in superconductor discovery by presenting a consistent computational database of critical fields $H_{c}$, $H_{c1}$, and $H_{c2}$ for over 7300 electron-phonon-paired superconductors covering distinct materials classes. A theoretical framework is developed that combines $α^2F(ω)$ spectral functions and highly accurate Fermi surfaces from density functional theory with clean-limit Eliashberg theory to obtain the coherence lengths, London penetration depths, and Ginzburg-Landau parameters. We discover an unexpectedly large number of Type-I superconductors and show that larger unit cells generically support higher critical fields and Type-II behavior. We identify the importance of going beyond BCS theory by including strong-coupling corrections to the superconducting gap and electron-phonon renormalizations of the effective mass for predictions of critical fields across materials. These results provide a framework for foundational AI models that realize the concept of inverse materials design for high-$T_{c}$ and high-critical-field superconductors.",

    "summary": "Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.",

    "summary": "Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.",
