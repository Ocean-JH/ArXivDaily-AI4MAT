    "summary": "Fast and accurate prediction of optimal crystal structure, topology, and microstructures is important for accelerating the design and discovery of new materials. A challenge lies in the exorbitantly large structural and compositional space presented by the various elements and their combinations. Speed, accuracy, and scalability are three desirables for any inverse design tool to sample efficiently across such a vast space. While traditional global optimization approaches (e.g., evolutionary algorithm, random sampling based) have demonstrated the ability to predict new crystal structures that can be used as super-hard materials, semiconductors, and photovoltaic materials to name a few, it is highly desirable to develop approaches that converge faster to the solution, have better solution quality, and are scalable to high dimensionality. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are emerging as powerful design tools capable of addressing these issues but primarily operate in discrete action space. In this work, we introduce CASTING, which is an RL-based scalable framework for crystal structure, topology, and potentially microstructure prediction. CASTING employs an RL-based continuous search space decision tree (MCTS -Monte Carlo Tree Search) algorithm with three important modifications (i) a modified rewards scheme for improved search space exploration (ii) a 'windowing' or 'funneling' scheme for improved exploitation and (iii) adaptive sampling during playouts for efficient and scalable search. Using a set of representative examples ranging from metals such as Ag to covalent systems such as C and multicomponent systems (graphane, boron nitride, and complex correlated oxides), we demonstrate the accuracy, the speed of convergence, and the scalability of CASTING to discover new metastable crystal structures and phases that meet the target objective.",

    "summary": "The ability to readily design novel materials with chosen functional properties on-demand represents a next frontier in materials discovery. However, thoroughly and efficiently sampling the entire design space in a computationally tractable manner remains a highly challenging task. To tackle this problem, we propose an inverse design framework (MatDesINNe) utilizing invertible neural networks which can map both forward and reverse processes between the design space and target property. This approach can be used to generate materials candidates for a designated property, thereby satisfying the highly sought-after goal of inverse design. We then apply this framework to the task of band gap engineering in two-dimensional materials, starting with MoS2. Within the design space encompassing six degrees of freedom in applied tensile, compressive and shear strain plus an external electric field, we show the framework can generate novel, high fidelity, and diverse candidates with near-chemical accuracy. We extend this generative capability further to provide insights regarding metal-insulator transition, important for memristive neuromorphic applications among others, in MoS2 which is not otherwise possible with brute force screening. This approach is general and can be directly extended to other materials and their corresponding design spaces and target properties.",

    "summary": "Active learning has been increasingly applied to screening functional materials from existing materials databases with desired properties. However, the number of known materials deposited in the popular materials databases such as ICSD and Materials Project is extremely limited and consists of just a tiny portion of the vast chemical design space. Herein we present an active generative inverse design method that combines active learning with a deep variational autoencoder neural network and a generative adversarial deep neural network model to discover new materials with a target property in the whole chemical design space. The application of this method has allowed us to discover new thermodynamically stable materials with high band gap (SrYF$_5$) and semiconductors with specified band gap ranges (SrClF$_3$, CaClF$_5$, YCl$_3$, SrC$_2$F$_3$, AlSCl, As$_2$O$_3$), all of which are verified by the first principle DFT calculations. Our experiments show that while active learning itself may sample chemically infeasible candidates, these samples help to train effective screening models for filtering out materials with desired properties from the hypothetical materials created by the generative model. The experiments show the effectiveness of our active generative inverse design approach.",

    "summary": "Designing functional materials requires a deep search through multidimensional spaces for system parameters that yield desirable material properties. For cases where conventional parameter sweeps or trial-and-error sampling are impractical, inverse methods that frame design as a constrained optimization problem present an attractive alternative. However, even efficient algorithms require time- and resource-intensive characterization of material properties many times during optimization, imposing a design bottleneck. Approaches that incorporate machine learning can help address this limitation and accelerate the discovery of materials with targeted properties. In this article, we review how to leverage machine learning to reduce dimensionality in order to effectively explore design space, accelerate property evaluation, and generate unconventional material structures with optimal properties. We also discuss promising future directions, including integration of machine learning into multiple stages of a design algorithm and interpretation of machine learning models to understand how design parameters relate to material properties.",

    "summary": "The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a \"one-shot\" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.",

While several thousand 2D materials have been screened in existing materials databases, discovering new 2D materials remains to be challenging. Herein we propose a deep learning generative model for composition generation combined with random forest based 2D materials classifier to discover new hypothetical 2D materials. Furthermore, a template based element substitution structure prediction approach is developed to predict the crystal structures of a subset of the newly predicted hypothetical formulas, which allows us to confirm their structure stability using DFT calculations. So far, we have discovered 267,489 new potential 2D materials compositions and confirmed twelve 2D/layered materials by DFT formation energy calculation. Our results show that generative machine learning models provide an effective way to explore the vast chemical design space for new 2D materials discovery.",

    "summary": "A fundamental challenge in materials design is linking building block attributes to crystal structure. Addressing this challenge is particularly difficult for systems that exhibit emergent order, such as entropy-stabilized colloidal crystals. We combine recently developed techniques in inverse design with machine learning to construct a model that correctly classifies the crystals of more than ten thousand polyhedral shapes into 13 different structures with a predictive accuracy of 96% using only two geometric shape measures. With three measures, 98% accuracy is achieved. We test our model on previously reported colloidal crystal structures for 71 symmetric polyhedra and obtain 92% accuracy. Our findings (1) demonstrate that entropic colloidal crystals are controlled by surprisingly few parameters, (2) provide a quantitative model to predict these crystals solely from the geometry of their building blocks, and (3) suggest a prediction paradigm that easily generalizes to other self-assembled materials.",

In addressing this challenge, machine learning generative models can offer promising opportunities since they allow for the continuous navigation of chemical space via low dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we employ a crystal representation that is inversion-free with a low memory requirement based on unit cell information and fractional atomic coordinates, and build the generative adversarial network (GAN) for crystal structures. The proposed model is then applied to the Mg-Mn-O ternary inorganic materials system to generate novel structures with application as potential water-splitting photoanodes, and combined with the evaluation of their photoanode properties for high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). The generative-HTVS system that we built predicts 23 new crystal structures with a reasonable predicted stability and bandgap. These findings suggest that the proposed generative model can be an effective way to explore hidden portions of the chemical space, an area that is usually unreachable when conventional substitution-based discovery is employed.",

However, lack of user-friendly materials informatics web servers has severely constrained the wide adoption of such tools in the daily practice of materials screening, tinkering, and design space exploration by materials scientists. Herein we first survey current materials informatics web apps and then propose and develop MaterialsAtlas.org, a web based materials informatics toolbox for materials discovery, which includes a variety of routinely needed tools for exploratory materials discovery, including materials composition and structure check (e.g. for neutrality, electronegativity balance, dynamic stability, Pauling rules), materials property prediction (e.g. band gap, elastic moduli, hardness, thermal conductivity), and search for hypothetical materials. These user-friendly tools can be freely accessed at \\url{www.materialsatlas.org}.

We implemented this combined uMLIP-RSS workflow to perform massive variable-composition crystal structure prediction across ternary systems, specifically targeting chiral space groups. High-throughput uMLIP-based optimization and stability screening of over 20 million randomly generated chiral structures identified numerous potentially stable phases out of existing database. Subsequent validation by first-principles confirmed over 120 new chiral inorganic crystals with promising functional applications, including topological characteristics, nonlinear optics, and superconductivity. Notably, this set includes materials exhibiting remarkable quantum phenomena, such as the nonlinear Hall effect driven by berry curvature dipole, quantum metric and symmetry-enforced six-fold topological points, long Fermi arcs and large magnetoresistance. This work substantially expands the pool of chiral functional materials and demonstrates a scalable, efficient strategy for predictive discovery in complex materials.",

Phys. 145, 111101 (2016)] by applying this simulated-based, machine learning method to optimize for interparticle interactions that self-assemble particles into a variety of complex microstructures: cluster fluids, porous mesophases, and crystalline lattices. Using the method, we discover isotropic pair interactions that lead to self-assembly of each of the desired morphologies, including several types of potentials that were not previously understood to be capable of stabilizing such systems. One such pair potential led to assembly of the highly asymmetric truncated trihexagonal lattice and another produced a fluid containing spherical voids, or pores, of designed size via purely repulsive interactions. Through these examples, we demonstrate several advantages inherent to this particular design approach including the use of a parametrized functional form for the optimized interparticle interactions, the ability to constrain the range of said parameters, and compatibility of the inverse design strategy with a variety of simulation protocols (e.g., positional restraints).",

Most recently, through complete analyses of symmetry-allowed band structures - including the theory of Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) - researchers have determined crystal-symmetry-enhanced Wilson-loop and complete symmetry-based indicators for nonmagnetic topological phases, leading to the discovery of higher-order TCIs and TSMs. The recent application of TQC and related methods to high-throughput materials discovery has revealed that over half of all of the known stoichiometric, solid-state, nonmagnetic materials are topological at the Fermi level, over 85% of the known stoichiometric materials host energetically isolated topological bands, and that just under $2/3$ of the energetically isolated bands in known materials carry the stable topology of a TI or TCI. In this Review, we survey topological electronic materials discovery in nonmagnetic crystalline solids from the prediction of the first 2D and 3D TIs to the recently introduced methods that have facilitated large-scale searches for topological materials. We also discuss future venues for the identification and manipulation of solid-state topological phases, including charge-density-wave compounds, magnetic materials, and 2D few-layer devices.",

    "summary": "Reticular materials, including metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, combine relative ease of synthesis and an impressive range of applications in various fields, from gas storage to biomedicine. Diverse properties arise from the variation of building units$\\unicode{x2013}$metal centers and organic linkers$\\unicode{x2013}$in almost infinite chemical space. Such variation substantially complicates experimental design and promotes the use of computational methods. In particular, the most successful artificial intelligence algorithms for predicting properties of reticular materials are atomic-level graph neural networks, which optionally incorporate domain knowledge. Nonetheless, the data-driven inverse design involving these models suffers from incorporation of irrelevant and redundant features such as full atomistic graph and network topology. In this study, we propose a new way of representing materials, aiming to overcome the limitations of existing methods; the message passing is performed on a coarse-grained crystal graph that comprises molecular building units. To highlight the merits of our approach, we assessed predictive performance and energy efficiency of neural networks built on different materials representations, including composition-based and crystal-structure-aware models. Coarse-grained crystal graph neural networks showed decent accuracy at low computational costs, making them a valuable alternative to omnipresent atomic-level algorithms. Moreover, the presented models can be successfully integrated into an inverse materials design pipeline as estimators of the objective function. Overall, the coarse-grained crystal graph framework is aimed at challenging the prevailing atom-centric perspective on reticular materials design.",

    "summary": "Traditional materials discovery approaches - relying primarily on laborious experiments - have controlled the pace of technology. Instead, computational approaches offer an accelerated path: high-throughput exploration and characterization of virtual structures. These ventures, performed by automated ab-initio frameworks, have rapidly expanded the volume of programmatically-accessible data, cultivating opportunities for data-driven approaches. Herein, a collection of robust characterization methods are presented, implemented within the Automatic Flow Framework for Materials Discovery (AFLOW), that leverages materials data for the prediction of phase diagrams and properties of disordered materials. These methods directly address the issue of materials synthesizability, bridging the gap between simulation and experiment. Powering these predictions is the AFLOW.org repository for inorganic crystals, the largest and most comprehensive database of its kind, containing more than 2 million compounds with about 100 different properties computed for each. As calculated with standardized parameter sets, the wealth of data also presents a favorable learning environment. Machine learning algorithms are employed for property prediction, descriptor development, design rule discovery, and the identification of candidate functional materials. When combined with physical models and intelligently formulated descriptors, the data becomes a powerful tool, facilitating the discovery of new materials for applications ranging from high-temperature superconductors to thermoelectrics. These methods have been validated by the synthesis of two new permanent magnets introduced herein - the first discovered by computational approaches.",

    "summary": "The large-scale search for high-performing candidate 2D materials is limited to calculating a few simple descriptors, usually with first-principles density functional theory calculations. In this work, we alleviate this issue by extending and generalizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks to systems with planar periodicity, and train an ensemble of models to predict thermodynamic, mechanical, and electronic properties. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we carry out a screening of nearly 45,000 structures for two largely disjoint applications: namely, mechanically robust composites and photovoltaics. An analysis of the uncertainty associated with our methods indicates the ensemble of neural networks is well-calibrated and has errors comparable with those from accurate first-principles density functional theory calculations. The ensemble of models allows us to gauge the confidence of our predictions, and to find the candidates most likely to exhibit effective performance in their applications. Since the datasets used in our screening were combinatorically generated, we are also able to investigate, using an innovative method, structural and compositional design principles that impact the properties of the structures surveyed and which can act as a generative model basis for future material discovery through reverse engineering. Our approach allowed us to recover some well-accepted design principles: for instance, we find that hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with lead and tin tend to be good candidates for solar cell applications.",

    "summary": "The true power of computational research typically can lay in either what it accomplishes or what it enables others to accomplish. In this work, both avenues are simultaneously embraced across several distinct efforts existing at three general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic, physical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics infrastructure is being built from the ground up based on (1) the fundamental understanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data, (2) deployment routes that take advantage of it, and (3) pathways to extend it in an autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion, while heavily relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to guide well-established DFT-based ab initio and CALPHAD-based thermodynamic methods.\n  The resulting multi-level discovery infrastructure is highly generalizable as it focuses on encoding problems to solve them easily rather than looking for an existing solution. To showcase it, this dissertation discusses the design of multi-alloy functionally graded materials (FGMs) incorporating ultra-high temperature refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) towards gas turbine and jet engine efficiency increase reducing CO2 emissions, as well as hypersonic vehicles. It leverages a new graph representation of underlying mathematical space using a newly developed algorithm based on combinatorics, not subject to many problems troubling the community. Underneath, property models and phase relations are learned from optimized samplings of the largest and highest quality dataset of HEA in the world, called ULTERA. At the atomistic level, a data ecosystem optimized for machine learning (ML) from over 4.5 million relaxed structures, called MPDD, is used to inform experimental observations and improve thermodynamic models by providing stability data enabled by a new efficient featurization framework.",

    "summary": "Computational prediction of stable crystal structures has a profound impact on the large-scale discovery of novel functional materials. However, predicting the crystal structure solely from a material's composition or formula is a promising yet challenging task, as traditional ab initio crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods rely on time-consuming global searches and first-principles free energy calculations. Inspired by the recent success of deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction, which utilize pairwise amino acid interactions to describe 3D structures, we present AlphaCrystal-II, a novel knowledge-based solution that exploits the abundant inter-atomic interaction patterns found in existing known crystal structures. AlphaCrystal-II predicts the atomic distance matrix of a target crystal material and employs this matrix to reconstruct its 3D crystal structure. By leveraging the wealth of inter-atomic relationships of known crystal structures, our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and reliability in structure prediction through comprehensive experiments. This work highlights the potential of data-driven methods in accelerating the discovery and design of new materials with tailored properties.",

    "summary": "Microstructural materials design is one of the most important applications of inverse modeling in materials science. Generally speaking, there are two broad modeling paradigms in scientific applications: forward and inverse. While the forward modeling estimates the observations based on known parameters, the inverse modeling attempts to infer the parameters given the observations. Inverse problems are usually more critical as well as difficult in scientific applications as they seek to explore the parameters that cannot be directly observed. Inverse problems are used extensively in various scientific fields, such as geophysics, healthcare and materials science. However, it is challenging to solve inverse problems, because they usually need to learn a one-to-many non-linear mapping, and also require significant computing time, especially for high-dimensional parameter space. Further, inverse problems become even more difficult to solve when the dimension of input (i.e. observation) is much lower than that of output (i.e. parameters). In this work, we propose a framework consisting of generative adversarial networks and mixture density networks for inverse modeling, and it is evaluated on a materials science dataset for microstructural materials design. Compared with baseline methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework can overcome the above-mentioned challenges and produce multiple promising solutions in an efficient manner.",

The materials' symmetry classifications represent the crystal polymorphs and are crucial for understanding phase transitions in materials. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of crystal system, point group, or space group symmetry information significantly enhances the predictive performance of the developed deep learning architecture, where the highest accuracy was achieved when space group classification was incorporated. In addition, we use the same model architecture to predict the energy above hull, an indicator to material stability, with formation energy as an additional input feature.",

Trained with materials from the ICSD database, our GAN model can generate hypothetical materials not existing in the training dataset, reaching a novelty of 92.53% when generating 2 million samples. The percentage of chemically valid (charge neutral and electronegativity balanced) samples out of all generated ones reaches 84.5% by our GAN when trained with materials from ICSD even though no such chemical rules are explicitly enforced in our GAN model, indicating its capability to learn implicit chemical composition rules. Our algorithm could be used to speed up inverse design or computational screening of inorganic materials.",

    "summary": "Self-supervised neural language models have recently achieved unprecedented success, from natural language processing to learning the languages of biological sequences and organic molecules. These models have demonstrated superior performance in the generation, structure classification, and functional predictions for proteins and molecules with learned representations. However, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed for generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to interpret their design logic. Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a neural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and tinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank filling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique advantages in learning the \"materials grammars\" together with high-quality generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically valid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\\% charge neutrality and 84.8\\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher compared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation process of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned materials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the TCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to discover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations. Our work thus brings the unsupervised transformer language models based generative artificial intelligence to inorganic materials. A user-friendly web app has been developed for computational materials doping and can be accessed freely at \\url{www.materialsatlas.org/blmtinker}.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can accelerate the design of materials by identifying correlations and complex patterns in data. However, AI methods commonly attempt to describe the entire, immense materials space with a single model, while it is typical that different mechanisms govern the materials behaviors across the materials space. The subgroup-discovery (SGD) approach identifies local rules describing exceptional subsets of data with respect to a given target. Thus, SGD can focus on mechanisms leading to exceptional performance. However, the identification of appropriate SG rules requires a careful consideration of the generality-exceptionality tradeoff. Here, we discuss challenges to advance the SGD approach in materials science and analyse the tradeoff between exceptionality and generality based on a Pareto front of SGD solutions.",

In chemistry, conventional methodologies for innovation usually rely on expensive and incremental strategies to optimize properties from molecular structures. On the other hand, inverse approaches map properties to structures, thus expediting the design of novel useful compounds. In this chapter, we examine the way in which current deep generative models are addressing the inverse chemical discovery paradigm. We begin by revisiting early inverse design algorithms. Then, we introduce generative models for molecular systems and categorize them according to their architecture and molecular representation. Using this classification, we review the evolution and performance of important molecular generation schemes reported in the literature. Finally, we conclude highlighting the prospects and challenges of generative models as cutting edge tools in materials discovery.",

Here we present a machine learning model that could predict whether the composition of a potential crystalline structure would be centrosymmetric or not. By evaluating a diverse set of composition features calculated using matminer featurizer package coupled with different machine learning algorithms, we find that Random Forest Classifiers give the best performance for noncentrosymmetric material prediction, reaching an accuracy of 84.8% when evaluated with 10 fold cross-validation on the dataset with 82,506 samples extracted from Materials Project. A random forest model trained with materials with only 3 elements gives even higher accuracy of 86.9%. We apply our ML model to screen potential noncentrosymmetric materials from 2,000,000 hypothetical materials generated by our inverse design engine and report the top 20 candidate noncentrosymmetric materials with 2 to 4 elements and top 20 borate candidates",

    "summary": "Additive manufacturing has become one of the forefront technologies in fabrication, enabling new products impossible to manufacture before. Although many materials exist for additive manufacturing, they typically suffer from performance trade-offs preventing them from replacing traditional manufacturing techniques. Current materials are designed with inefficient human-driven intuition-based methods, leaving them short of optimal solutions. We propose a machine learning approach to accelerate the discovery of additive manufacturing materials with optimal trade-offs in mechanical performance. A multi-objective optimization algorithm automatically guides the experimental design by proposing how to mix primary formulations to create better-performing materials. The algorithm is coupled with a semi-autonomous fabrication platform to significantly reduce the number of performed experiments and overall time to solution. Without any prior knowledge of the primary formulations, the proposed methodology autonomously uncovers twelve optimal composite formulations and enlarges the discovered performance space 288 times after only 30 experimental iterations. This methodology could easily be generalized to other material formulation problems and enable completely automated discovery of a wide variety of material designs.",

    "summary": "The advent of two-dimensional metamaterials in recent years has ushered in a revolutionary means to manipulate the behavior of light on the nanoscale. The effective parameters of these architected materials render unprecedented control over the optical properties of light, thereby eliciting previously unattainable applications in flat lenses, holographic imaging, and emission control among others. The design of such structures, to date, has relied on the expertise of an optical scientist to guide a progression of electromagnetic simulations that iteratively solve Maxwell's equations until a locally optimized solution can be attained. In this work, we identify a solution to circumvent this intuition-guided design by means of a deep learning architecture. When fed an input set of optical spectra, the constructed generative network assimilates a candidate pattern from a user-defined dataset of geometric structures in order to match the input spectra. The generated metamaterial patterns demonstrate high fidelity, yielding equivalent optical spectra at an average accuracy of about 0.9. This approach reveals an opportunity to expedite the discovery and design of metasurfaces for tailored optical responses in a systematic, inverse-design manner.",

    "summary": "Inverse design of materials with desired properties is currently laborious and heavily relies on intuition of researchers through a trial-and-error process. The massive combinational spaces due to the constituent elements and their structural configurations are too overwhelming to be all searched even by high-throughput computations. Herein, we demonstrated a novel regressional generative adversarial network (RGAN) for inverse design of representative two-dimensional materials, graphene and boron-nitride (BN) hybrids. A significant novelty of the proposed RGAN is that it combines the supervised and regressional convolutional neural network (CNN) with the traditional unsupervised GAN, thus overcoming the common technical barrier in the traditional GANs, which cannot generate data associated with given continuous quantitative labels. The proposed RGAN enables to autonomously generate graphene/BN hybrids with any given bandgaps. Moreover, the generated structures exhibit high fidelity, yielding bandgaps within ~ 10% MAEF of the desired bandgaps as cross-validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Further analysis by principle component analysis (PCA) and modified locally linear embedding (MLLE) methods on the latent features encoded by the regressor reveals that the generator has successfully generated structures that followed the statistical distribution of the real structures. It implies the possibility of the RGAN in recognizing physical rules hidden in the high-dimensional data. This new inverse design methodology would speed up the discovery and development of other 2D materials and beyond.",

    "summary": "Mechanical and phononic metamaterials exhibiting negative elastic moduli, gapped vibrational spectra, or topologically protected modes enable precise control of structural and acoustic functionalities. While much progress has been made in their experimental and theoretical characterization, the inverse design of mechanical metamaterials with arbitrarily programmable spectral properties and mode localization remains an unsolved problem. Here, we present a flexible computational inverse-design framework that allows the efficient tuning of one or more gaps at nearly arbitrary positions in the spectrum of discrete phononic metamaterial structures. The underlying algorithm optimizes the linear response of elastic networks directly, is applicable to ordered and disordered structures, scales efficiently in 2D and 3D, and can be combined with a wide range of numerical optimization schemes. We illustrate the broad practical potential of this approach by designing mechanical bandgap switches that open and close pre-programmed spectral gaps in response to an externally applied stimulus such as shear or compression. We further show that the designed structures can host topologically protected edge modes, and validate the numerical predictions through explicit 3D finite element simulations of continuum elastica with experimentally relevant material parameters. Generally, this network-based inverse design paradigm offers a direct pathway towards manufacturing phononic metamaterials, DNA origami structures and topolectric circuits that can realize a wide range of static and dynamic target functionalities.",

    "summary": "Materials discovery is crucial for making scientific advances in many domains. Collections of data from experiments and first-principle computations have spurred interest in applying machine learning methods to create predictive models capable of mapping from composition and crystal structures to materials properties. Generally, these are regression problems with the input being a 1D vector composed of numerical attributes representing the material composition and/or crystal structure. While neural networks consisting of fully connected layers have been applied to such problems, their performance often suffers from the vanishing gradient problem when network depth is increased. In this paper, we study and propose design principles for building deep regression networks composed of fully connected layers with numerical vectors as input. We introduce a novel deep regression network with individual residual learning, IRNet, that places shortcut connections after each layer so that each layer learns the residual mapping between its output and input. We use the problem of learning properties of inorganic materials from numerical attributes derived from material composition and/or crystal structure to compare IRNet's performance against that of other machine learning techniques. Using multiple datasets from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and Materials Project for training and evaluation, we show that IRNet provides significantly better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches currently used by domain scientists. We also show that IRNet's use of individual residual learning leads to better convergence during the training phase than when shortcut connections are between multi-layer stacks while maintaining the same number of parameters.",

    "summary": "Linear models, such as force constant (FC) and cluster expansions, play a key role in physics and materials science. While they can in principle be parametrized using regression and feature selection approaches, the convergence behavior of these techniques, in particular with respect to thermodynamic properties is not well understood. Here, we therefore analyze the efficacy and efficiency of several state-of-the-art regression and feature selection methods, in particular in the context of FC extraction and the prediction of different thermodynamic properties. Generic feature selection algorithms such as recursive feature elimination with ordinary least-squares (OLS), automatic relevance determination regression, and the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator can yield physically sound models for systems with a modest number of degrees of freedom. For large unit cells with low symmetry and/or high-order expansions they come, however, with a non-negligible computational cost that can be more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of OLS. In such cases, OLS with cutoff selection provides a viable route as demonstrated here for both second-order FCs in large low-symmetry unit cells and high-order FCs in low-symmetry systems. While regression techniques are thus very powerful, they require well-tuned protocols. Here, the present work establishes guidelines for the design of protocols that are readily usable, e.g., in high-throughput and materials discovery schemes. Since the underlying algorithms are not specific to FC construction, the general conclusions drawn here also have a bearing on the construction of other linear models in physics and materials science.",

We can then generate and screen thousands of novel materials, efficiently predicting their topological character without the need for a priori structural knowledge. We discover 56 non-trivial materials, of which 17 novel insulating candidates for further investigation, for which we corroborate their topological properties with density functional theory calculations. This strategy is 10$\\times$ more efficient than the trial-and-error approach while few orders of magnitude faster and is a proof of concept for guiding improved materials discovery search strategies.",

Advanced AI technologies, especially reinforcement learning (RL), have emerged as a powerful tool to augment and accelerate this inverse design process. By modeling the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequential decision-making problem, RL approaches can construct a satisfactory PCSEL structure from scratch. However, the data inefficiency resulting from online interactions with precise and expensive simulation environments impedes the broader applicability of RL approaches. Recently, sequential models, especially the Transformer architecture, have exhibited compelling performance in sequential decision-making problems due to their simplicity and scalability to large language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named PCSEL Inverse Design Transformer (PiT) that abstracts the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequence modeling problem. The central part of our PiT is a Transformer-based structure that leverages the past trajectories and current states to predict the current actions. Compared with the traditional RL approaches, PiT can output the optimal actions and achieve target PCSEL designs by leveraging offline data and conditioning on the desired return. Results demonstrate that PiT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines.",

We further train a precise NequIP model to facilitate accurate and rapid simulations of Mg ionic conductivity. From the 160 high voltage structures, the machine learning molecular dynamics simulations have selected 23 cathode materials with both high energy density and high ionic conductivity. This AI-driven workflow dramatically boosts the efficiency and precision of material discovery for multivalent ion batteries, paving the way for advanced Mg battery development.",

    "summary": "Electronic materials exhibiting phase transitions between metastable states (e.g., metal-insulator transition materials with abrupt electrical resistivity transformations) are challenging to decode. For these materials, conventional machine learning methods display limited predictive capability due to data scarcity and the absence of features impeding model training. In this article, we demonstrate a discovery strategy based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization to directly circumvent these bottlenecks by utilizing latent variable Gaussian processes combined with high-fidelity electronic structure calculations for validation in the chalcogenide lacunar spinel family. We directly and simultaneously learn phase stability and band gap tunability from chemical composition alone to efficiently discover all superior compositions on the design Pareto front. Previously unidentified electronic transitions also emerge from our featureless adaptive optimization engine. Our methodology readily generalizes to optimization of multiple properties, enabling co-design of complex multifunctional materials, especially where prior data is sparse.",

    "summary": "Discovering new physical products and processes often demands enormous experimentation and expensive simulation. To design a new product with certain target characteristics, an extensive search is performed in the design space by trying out a large number of design combinations before reaching to the target characteristics. However, forward searching for the target design becomes prohibitive when the target is itself moving or only partially understood. To address this bottleneck, we propose to use backward prediction by leveraging the rich data generated during earlier exploration and construct a machine learning framework to predict the design parameters for any target in a single step. This poses two technical challenges: the first caused due to one-to-many mapping when learning the inverse problem and the second caused due to an user specifying the target specifications only partially. To overcome the challenges, we formulate this problem as conditional density estimation under high-dimensional setting with incomplete input and multimodal output. We solve the problem through a deep hybrid generative-discriminative model, which is trained end-to-end to predict the optimum design.",

    "summary": "The recently proposed crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) offers a highly versatile and accurate machine learning (ML) framework by learning material properties directly from graph-like representations of crystal structures (\"crystal graphs\"). Here, we develop an improved variant of the CGCNN model (iCGCNN) that outperforms the original by incorporating information of the Voronoi tessellated crystal structure, explicit 3-body correlations of neighboring constituent atoms, and an optimized chemical representation of interatomic bonds in the crystal graphs. We demonstrate the accuracy of the improved framework in two distinct illustrations: First, when trained/validated on 180,000/20,000 density functional theory (DFT) calculated thermodynamic stability entries taken from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and evaluated on a separate test set of 230,000 entries, iCGCNN achieves a predictive accuracy that is significantly improved, i.e., 20% higher than that of the original CGCNN. Second, when used to assist high-throughput search for materials in the ThCr2Si2 structure-type, iCGCNN exhibited a success rate of 31% which is 310 times higher than an undirected high-throughput search and 2.4 times higher than that of the original CGCNN. Using both CGCNN and iCGCNN, we screened 132,600 compounds with elemental decorations of the ThCr2Si2 prototype crystal structure and identified a total of 97 new unique stable compounds by performing 757 DFT calculations, accelerating the computational time of the high-throughput search by a factor of 130. Our results suggest that the iCGCNN can be used to accelerate high-throughput discoveries of new materials by quickly and accurately identifying crystalline compounds with properties of interest.",

However, the exotic quantum phenomena are typically observable only in rare material systems under extreme experimental conditions. The search of suitable candidate materials that are able to work at ambient conditions is thus of crucial importance to both fundamental research and practical applications. Here we review our recent efforts on first-principles exploration of novel quantum physics and materials, focusing on emergent quantum phenomena induced by spin-orbit coupling and its interplay with magnetism, topology and superconductivity. The first-principles material design guided by fundamental theory enables the discoveries of several key quantum materials, including next-generation magnetic topological insulators, high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, and unconventional superconductors. A close collaboration with experiment not only successfully confirmed most of our theoretical predictions, but also led to surprising findings for further investigations, which greatly promotes development of the research field.",

Compared to the state-of-the-art models, CTGNN incorporates the graph network structure for capturing local atomic interactions and the dual-Transformer structures to model intra-crystal and inter-atomic relationships comprehensively. The benchmark carried on by the proposed CTGNN indicates that CTGNN significantly outperforms existing models like CGCNN and MEGNET in the prediction of formation energy and bandgap properties.

Generative models have emerged as a new paradigm in crystal structure prediction(CSP), however, accurately capturing key characteristics of crystal structures, such as periodicity and symmetry, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Crystal Structure Prediction (TransVAE-CSP), who learns the characteristic distribution space of stable materials, enabling both the reconstruction and generation of crystal structures. TransVAE-CSP integrates adaptive distance expansion with irreducible representation to effectively capture the periodicity and symmetry of crystal structures, and the encoder is a transformer network based on an equivariant dot product attention mechanism. Experimental results on the carbon_24, perov_5, and mp_20 datasets demonstrate that TransVAE-CSP outperforms existing methods in structure reconstruction and generation tasks under various modeling metrics, offering a powerful tool for crystal structure design and optimization.",

    "summary": "Crystal structure prediction is now playing an increasingly important role in discovery of new materials. Global optimization methods such as genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been combined with first principle free energy calculations to predict crystal structures given composition or only a chemical system. While these approaches can exploit certain crystal patterns such as symmetry and periodicity in their search process, they usually do not exploit the large amount of implicit rules and constraints of atom configurations embodied in the large number of known crystal structures. They currently can only handle crystal structure prediction of relatively small systems. Inspired by the knowledge-rich protein structure prediction approach, herein we explore whether known geometric constraints such as the atomic contact map of a target crystal material can help predict its structure given its space group information. We propose a global optimization based algorithm, CMCrystal, for crystal structure reconstruction based on atomic contact maps. Based on extensive experiments using six global optimization algorithms, we show that it is viable to reconstruct the crystal structure given the atomic contact map for some crystal materials but more constraints are needed for other target materials to achieve successful reconstruction. This implies that atomic interaction information learned from existing materials can be used to improve crystal structure prediction.",

However, existing CSP methods heavily rely on formation enthalpies derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, often overlooking differences between DFT and experimental values. Moreover, material synthesis is intricately influenced by factors such as kinetics and experimental conditions. To overcome these limitations, a novel collaborative approach was proposed for CSP that combines DFT with experimental data, utilizing advanced deep learning models and optimization algorithms. We illustrate the capability to predict formation enthalpies that closely align with actual experimental observations through the transfer learning on experimental data. By incorporating experimental synthesizable information of crystals, our model is capable of reverse engineering crystal structures that can be synthesized in experiments. Applying the model to 17 representative compounds, the results indicate that the model can accurately identify experimentally synthesized structures with high precision. Moreover, the obtained formation enthalpies and lattice constants closely align with experimental values, underscoring the model's effectiveness. The synergistic approach between theoretical and experimental data bridges the longstanding disparities between theoretical predictions and experimental results, thereby alleviating the demand for extensive and costly experimental trials.",

The predictor model is based on the popular convolution neural network architecture and trained with the help of finite element simulations. Further, the developed property predictor model is used as a feedback mechanism in the neural network based generator model. The proposed predictive-generative model can be used to obtain the micro-structure for maximization of particular elastic properties as well as for specified elastic constants. One of the major hurdle for deployment of the deep learning techniques in composite material design is the intensive computational resources required to generate the training data sets. To this end, a novel data augmentation scheme is presented. The application of data augmentation scheme results in significant saving of computational resources in the training phase. The proposed data augmentation approach is general and can be used in any setting involving the periodic micro-structures. The efficacy of the predictive-generative model is demonstrated through various examples. It is envisaged that the developed model will significantly reduce the cost and time associated with the composite material designing process for advanced applications.",

    "summary": "Amorphous multi-element materials offer unprecedented tunability in composition and properties, yet their rational design remains challenging due to the lack of predictive structure-property relationships and the vast configurational space. Traditional modeling struggles to capture the intricate short-range order that dictates their stability and functionality. We here introduce ApolloX, a pioneering predictive framework for amorphous multi-element materials, establishing a new paradigm by integrating physics-informed generative modeling with particle swarm optimization, using chemical short-range order as an explicit constraint. By systematically navigating the disordered energy landscape, ApolloX enables the targeted design of thermodynamically stable amorphous configurations. It accurately predicts atomic-scale arrangements, including composition-driven metal clustering and amorphization trends, which are well-validated by experiments, while also guiding synthesis by leveraging sluggish diffusion to control elemental distribution and disorder. The resulting structural evolution, governed by composition, directly impacts catalytic performance, leading to improved activity and stability with increasing amorphization. This predictive-experimental synergy transforms the discovery of amorphous materials, unlocking new frontiers in catalysis, energy storage, and functional disordered systems.",

The range of available singlet fission molecules is, however, limited as to undergo singlet fission, molecules have to satisfy certain energy conditions. Recent advances in material search using inverse design has enabled the prediction of materials for a wide range of applications and has emerged as one of the most efficient methods in the discovery of suitable materials. It is particularly helpful in manipulating large datasets, uncovering hidden information from the molecular dataset and generating new structures. However, we seldom encounter large datasets in structure prediction problems in material science. In our work, we put forward inverse design of possible singlet fission molecules using a transfer learning based approach where we make use of a much larger ChEMBL dataset of structurally similar molecules to transfer the learned characteristics to the singlet fission dataset.",

The studies of graphene have also led to further research in exploring the field of two dimensional (2D) systems in general. For instance, a number of other 2D crystals (not based on carbon, e.g., boronitrene, silicone, graphane, etc.) have been synthesized or predicted theoretically in recent years. Further, theoretical studies have predicted the possibility of other 2D hexagonal crystals of Ge, SiC, GeC, AlN, GaN, etc. The properties of these 2D materials are very different from their bulk. We shall present the general exotic properties of graphene like 2D systems followed by our computational results on the structural and electronic properties of some of them.",

Here, we develop a crystal graph convolutional neural networks framework to directly learn material properties from the connection of atoms in the crystal, providing a universal and interpretable representation of crystalline materials. Our method provides a highly accurate prediction of density functional theory calculated properties for eight different properties of crystals with various structure types and compositions after being trained with $10^4$ data points. Further, our framework is interpretable because one can extract the contributions from local chemical environments to global properties. Using an example of perovskites, we show how this information can be utilized to discover empirical rules for materials design.",

    "summary": "One of the long-standing problems in materials science is how to predict a material's structure and then its properties given only its composition. Experimental characterization of crystal structures has been widely used for structure determination, which is however too expensive for high-throughput screening. At the same time, directly predicting crystal structures from compositions remains a challenging unsolved problem. Herein we propose a deep learning algorithm for predicting the XRD spectrum given only the composition of a material, which can then be used to infer key structural features for downstream structural analysis such as crystal system or space group classification or crystal lattice parameter determination or materials property predictions. Benchmark studies on two datasets show that our DeepXRD algorithm can achieve good performance for XRD prediction as evaluated over our test sets. It can thus be used in high-throughput screening in the huge materials composition space for new materials discovery.",

Here, we use a supervised-autoencoder (sAE) to perform inverse design of graphene kirigami, where predicting the ultimate stress or strain under tensile loading is known to be difficult due to nonlinear effects arising from the out-of-plane buckling. Unlike the standard autoencoder, our sAE is able not only to reconstruct cut configurations but also to predict mechanical properties of graphene kirigami and classify the kirigami witheither parallel or orthogonal cuts. By interpolating in the latent space of kirigami structures, the sAE is able to generate novel designs that mix parallel and orthogonal cuts, despite being trained independently on parallel or orthogonal cuts. Our method allows us to both identify novel designs and predict, with reasonable accuracy, their mechanical properties, which is crucial for expanding the search space for materials design.",

    "summary": "Active search is a learning paradigm for actively identifying as many members of a given class as possible. A critical target scenario is high-throughput screening for scientific discovery, such as drug or materials discovery. In this paper, we approach this problem in Bayesian decision framework. We first derive the Bayesian optimal policy under a natural utility, and establish a theoretical hardness of active search, proving that the optimal policy can not be approximated for any constant ratio. We also study the batch setting for the first time, where a batch of $b>1$ points can be queried at each iteration. We give an asymptotic lower bound, linear in batch size, on the adaptivity gap: how much we could lose if we query $b$ points at a time for $t$ iterations, instead of one point at a time for $bt$ iterations. We then introduce a novel approach to nonmyopic approximations of the optimal policy that admits efficient computation. Our proposed policy can automatically trade off exploration and exploitation, without relying on any tuning parameters. We also generalize our policy to batch setting, and propose two approaches to tackle the combinatorial search challenge. We evaluate our proposed policies on a large database of drug discovery and materials science. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed policy in both sequential and batch setting; the nonmyopic behavior is also illustrated in various aspects.",

While the analysis of PXRD often requires extensive human manual intervention, and most automated method only achieved at coarse-grained level. The more difficult and important task of fine-grained crystal structure prediction from PXRD remains unaddressed. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant deep generative model for end-to-end crystal structure prediction from PXRD. Unlike previous crystal structure prediction methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet's effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 in conditional crystal structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet enables the direct prediction of crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for manual intervention and external databases. This opens up new possibilities for automated crystal structure determination and the accelerated discovery of novel materials.",

    "summary": "Compositional disorder induces myriad captivating phenomena in perovskites. Target-driven discovery of perovskite solid solutions has been a great challenge due to the analytical complexity introduced by disorder. Here, we demonstrate that an unsupervised deep learning strategy can find fingerprints of disordered materials that embed perovskite formability and underlying crystal structure information by learning only from the chemical composition, manifested in (A1-xA'x)BO3 and A(B1-xB'x)O3 formulae. This phenomenon can be capitalized to predict the crystal symmetry of experimental compositions, outperforming several supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. The educated nature of material fingerprints has led to the conception of analogical materials discovery that facilitates inverse exploration of promising perovskites based on similarity investigation with known materials. The search space of unstudied perovskites is screened from ~600,000 feasible compounds using experimental data powered ML models and automated web mining tools at a 94% success rate. This concept further provides insights on possible phase transitions and computational modelling of complex compositions. The proposed quantitative analysis of materials analogies is expected to bridge the gap between the existing materials literature and the undiscovered terrain.",

Since single-phase materials exist rarely in nature with such cross-coupling properties, an intensive research activity is being pursued towards the discovery of new single-phase multiferroic materials and the design of new engineered materials with strong magneto-electric (ME) coupling. This review article summarizes the development of different kinds of multiferroic material: single-phase and composite ceramic, laminated composite, and nanostructured thin films. Thin-film nanostructures have higher magnitude direct ME coupling values and clear evidence of indirect ME coupling compared with bulk materials. Promising ME coupling coefficients have been reported in laminated composite materials in which signal to noise ratio is good for device fabrication. We describe the possible applications of these materials.",

    "summary": "The generation of plausible crystal structures is often the first step in predicting the structure and properties of a material from its chemical composition. Quickly generating and predicting inorganic crystal structures is important for the discovery of new materials, which can target applications such as energy or electronic devices. However, most current methods for crystal structure prediction are computationally expensive, slowing the pace of innovation. Seeding structure prediction algorithms with quality generated candidates can overcome a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce CrystaLLM, a methodology for the versatile generation of crystal structures, based on the autoregressive large language modeling (LLM) of the Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format. Trained on millions of CIF files, CrystaLLM focuses on modeling crystal structures through text. CrystaLLM can produce plausible crystal structures for a wide range of inorganic compounds unseen in training, as demonstrated by ab initio simulations. The integration with predictors of formation energy permits the use of a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to improve the generation of meaningful structures. Our approach challenges conventional representations of crystals, and demonstrates the potential of LLMs for learning effective 'world models' of crystal chemistry, which will lead to accelerated discovery and innovation in materials science.",

    "summary": "The van der Waals (vdW) materials with low dimensions have been extensively studied as a platform to generate exotic quantum properties. Advancing this view, a great deal of attention is currently paid to topological quantum materials with vdW structures. Here, we provide a new concept of designing topological materials by the vdW stacking of quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs). Most interestingly, a slight shift of inversion center in the unit cell caused by a modification of stacking is found to induce the topological variation from a trivial insulator to a higher-order topological insulator (HOTI). Based on that, we present the first experimental realization of a HOTI by investigating a bismuth bromide Bi4Br4 with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The unique feature in bismuth halides capable of selecting various topology only by differently stacking chains, combined with the great advantage of the vdW structure, offers a fascinating playground for engineering topologically non-trivial edge-states toward future spintronics applications.",

    "summary": "Organic molecular ferroelectrics, including organic proton-transfer ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics, are potentially attractive in organic electronics and have significant chemical tunability. Among these, acid-base proton transfer (PT) salts stand out due to their low coercive fields and the possibility to tune their properties with different acid-base combinations. Using crystal structure prediction, combining small acid and base organic molecular species, we here predict three novel acid-base PT ferroelectric salts with higher polarization than existing materials. We also report two combinations that form antiferroelectric crystal structures. However, some combinations also result in unfavorable packing or the formation of co-crystal or in one case a divalent salt. The protonation state is found to be highly linked to the crystal structure, with cases where salt crystal structures have the same energetic preferability as co-crystals with a different crystalline packing.",

    "summary": "We propose a method for crystal structure prediction based on a new structure generation algorithm and on-lattice machine learning interatomic potentials. Our algorithm generates the atomic configurations assigning atomic species to sites of the given lattice, and uses cluster expansion or low-rank potential to evaluate their energy. We demonstrate two benefits of such approach. First, our structure generation algorithm offers a ``smart'' configurational space sampling, targeting low-energy structures which significantly reduces computational costs. Second, the application of machine learning interatomic potentials significantly reduces the number of DFT calculations. We discuss how our algorithm resembles the latent diffusion models for image generation. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by constructing the convex hull of Nb-Mo-Ta-W system, including binary and ternary Nb-W and Mo-Ta-W subsystems. We found new binary, ternary, and quaternary stable structures that are not reported in the AFLOW database which we choose as our baseline. Due to the computational efficiency of our method we anticipate that it can pave the way towards efficient high-throughput discovery of multicomponent materials.",

    "summary": "A large transverse thermoelectric response, known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) has been recently observed in several topological magnets. Building a thermopile employing this effect has been the subject of several recent propositions. Here, we design and build a thermopile with an array of tilted adjacent crystals of Mn$_3$Sn. The design employs a single material and replaces pairs of P and N thermocouples of the traditional design with hermaphroditic legs. The design exploits the large lag angle between the applied field and the magnetization, which we attribute to the interruption of magnetic octupoles at the edge of $xy$-plane. Eliminating extrinsic contacts between legs will boost the efficiency, simplify the process and pave the way for a new generation of thermopiles.",

Existing symbolic/sparse regression methods rely on the availability of libraries of material models, which are typically hand-designed by a human expert using known models as reference, or deploy generative algorithms with exponential complexity which are only practicable for very simple expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to constitutive law discovery relying on formal grammars as an automated and systematic tool to generate constitutive law expressions. Compliance with physics constraints is partly enforced a priori and partly empirically checked a posteriori. We deploy the approach for two tasks: i) Automatically generating a library of valid constitutive laws for hyperelastic isotropic materials; ii) Performing data-driven discovery of hyperelastic material models from displacement data affected by different noise levels. For the task of automatic library generation, we demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed methodology in avoiding hand-crafted features and human intervention. For the data-driven discovery task, we demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and significant generalizability of the proposed methodology.",

    "summary": "Machine learning has the potential to accelerate materials discovery by accurately predicting materials properties at a low computational cost. However, the model inputs remain a key stumbling block. Current methods typically use descriptors constructed from knowledge of either the full crystal structure -- therefore only applicable to materials with already characterised structures -- or structure-agnostic fixed-length representations hand-engineered from the stoichiometry. We develop a machine learning approach that takes only the stoichiometry as input and automatically learns appropriate and systematically improvable descriptors from data. Our key insight is to treat the stoichiometric formula as a dense weighted graph between elements. Compared to the state of the art for structure-agnostic methods, our approach achieves lower errors with less data.",

We introduce TCSP 2.0, a substantial evolution of our template-based crystal structure prediction framework that advances predictive capabilities through synergistic integration of several key techniques into its major components. Building upon TCSP 1.0's template-matching foundation, this enhanced version implements three critical innovations: (1) replacement of Pymatgen with deep learning-based BERTOS model for oxidation state prediction with superior performance, (2) implementation of sophisticated element embedding distance metrics for improved chemical similarity assessment, and (3) development of a robust majority voting mechanism for space group selection that reduces prediction uncertainty. TCSP 2.0 also expands its template base by incorporating template structures from Materials Cloud, C2DB, and GNoME databases alongside the original Materials Project repository, creating a more comprehensive structural foundation. Rigorous validation across 180 diverse test cases of the CSPBenchmark demonstrates TCSP 2.0's exceptional performance, achieving 83.89% space-group success rate and 78.33% structural similarity accuracy for top-5 predictions, substantially outperforming both its predecessor and the competing modern CSP algorithms including CSPML and EquiCSP.",

Currently only heuristic rules exist for guessing the oxidation states of a given compound with many exceptions. Recent work has developed machine learning models based on heuristic structural features for predicting the oxidation states of metal ions. However, composition based oxidation state prediction still remains elusive so far, which is more important in new material discovery for which the structures are not even available. This work proposes a novel deep learning based BERT transformer language model BERTOS for predicting the oxidation states of all elements of inorganic compounds given only their chemical composition. Our model achieves 96.82\\% accuracy for all-element oxidation states prediction benchmarked on the cleaned ICSD dataset and achieves 97.61\\% accuracy for oxide materials. We also demonstrate how it can be used to conduct large-scale screening of hypothetical material compositions for materials discovery.",

Although MPEAs remain under extensive research, traditional (i.e. empirical) alloy production and testing is both costly and time-consuming, partly due to the inefficiency of the early discovery process which involves experiments on a large number of alloy compositions. It is intuitive to apply machine learning in the discovery of this novel class of materials, of which only a small number of potential alloys has been probed to date. In this work, a proof-of-concept is proposed, combining generative adversarial networks (GANs) with discriminative neural networks (NNs), to accelerate the exploration of novel MPEAs. By applying the GAN model herein, it was possible to directly generate novel compositions for MPEAs, and to predict their phases. To verify the predictability of the model, alloys designed by the model are presented and a candidate produced; as validation. This suggests that the model herein offers an approach that can significantly enhance the capacity and efficiency of development of novel MPEAs.",

However, recent developments challenge this by reporting accurate property-prediction machine learning (ML) frameworks using composition alone without knowledge of the local atomic environments or long-range order. To probe this behavior, we conduct a systematic comparison of supervised ML models built on composition only vs. composition plus structure features. Similar performance for property prediction is found using both models for compounds close to the thermodynamic convex hull. We hypothesize that composition embeds structural information of ground-state structures in support of composition-centric models for property prediction and inverse design of stable compounds.",

Here we extend this method to predict the crystal structure of polymers by performing constrained evolutionary search, where each monomeric unit is treated as one or several building blocks with fixed connectivity. This greatly reduces the search space and allows the initial structure generation with different sequences and packings using these blocks. The new constrained evolutionary algorithm is successfully tested and validated on a diverse range of experimentally known polymers, namely polyethylene (PE), polyacetylene (PA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), poly(oxymethylene) (POM), poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO), and poly (p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS). By fixing the orientation of polymeric chains, this method can be further extended to predict all polymorphs of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and the complex linear polymer crystals, such as nylon-6 and cellulose. The excellent agreement between predicted crystal structures and experimentally known structures assures a major role of this approach in the efficient design of the future polymeric materials.",

    "summary": "We describe a first open-access database of experimentally investigated hybrid organic-inorganic materials with two-dimensional (2D) perovskite-like crystal structure. The database includes 515 compounds, containing 180 different organic cations, 10 metals (Pb, Sn, Bi, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ge, Mn, Pd, Sb) and 3 halogens (I, Br, Cl) known so far and will be regularly updated. The database contains a geometrical and crystal chemical analysis of the structures, which are useful to reveal quantitative structure-property relationships for this class of compounds. We show that the penetration depth of spacer organic cation into the inorganic layer and M-X-M bond angles increase in the number of inorganic layers (n). The machine learning model is developed and trained on the database, for the prediction of a band gap with accuracy within 0.1 eV. Another machine learning model is trained for the prediction of atomic partial charges with accuracy within 0.01 e. We show that the predicted values of band gaps decrease with an increase of the n and with an increase of M-X-M angles for single-layered perovskites. In general, the proposed database and machine learning models are shown to be useful tools for the rational design of new 2D hybrid perovskite materials.",

    "summary": "Inverse molecular design is critical in material science and drug discovery, where the generated molecules should satisfy certain desirable properties. In this paper, we propose equivariant energy-guided stochastic differential equations (EEGSDE), a flexible framework for controllable 3D molecule generation under the guidance of an energy function in diffusion models. Formally, we show that EEGSDE naturally exploits the geometric symmetry in 3D molecular conformation, as long as the energy function is invariant to orthogonal transformations. Empirically, under the guidance of designed energy functions, EEGSDE significantly improves the baseline on QM9, in inverse molecular design targeted to quantum properties and molecular structures. Furthermore, EEGSDE is able to generate molecules with multiple target properties by combining the corresponding energy functions linearly.",

    "summary": "Accessing the synthesizability of crystal structures is pivotal for advancing the practical application of theoretical material structures designed by machine learning or high-throughput screening. However, a significant gap exists between the actual synthesizability and thermodynamic or kinetic stability, which is commonly used for screening theoretical structures for experiments. To address this, we develop the Crystal Synthesis Large Language Models (CSLLM) framework, which includes three LLMs for predicting the synthesizability, synthesis methods, and precursors. We create a comprehensive synthesizability dataset including 140,120 crystal structures and develop an efficient text representation method for crystal structures to fine-tune the LLMs. The Synthesizability LLM achieves a remarkable 98.6% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional synthesizability screening based on thermodynamic and kinetic stability by 106.1% and 44.5%, respectively. The Methods LLM achieves a classification accuracy of 91.02%, and the Precursors LLM has an 80.2% success rate in predicting synthesis precursors. Furthermore, we develop a user-friendly graphical interface that enables automatic predictions of synthesizability and precursors from uploaded crystal structure files. Through these contributions, CSLLM bridges the gap between theoretical material design and experimental synthesis, paving the way for the rapid discovery of novel and synthesizable functional materials.",

To enable theoretical studies of experimentally unresolvable structures as well as high-throughput virtual screening, we present an algorithm for crystal structure prediction of lead halide perovskites.

    "summary": "Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is now increasingly used in the discovery of novel materials with applications in diverse industries. However, despite decades of developments, the problem is far from being solved. With the progress of deep learning, search algorithms, and surrogate energy models, there is a great opportunity for breakthroughs in this area. However, the evaluation of CSP algorithms primarily relies on manual structural and formation energy comparisons. The lack of a set of well-defined quantitative performance metrics for CSP algorithms make it difficult to evaluate the status of the field and identify the strengths and weaknesses of different CSP algorithms. Here, we analyze the quality evaluation issue in CSP and propose a set of quantitative structure similarity metrics, which when combined can be used to automatically determine the quality of the predicted crystal structures compared to the ground truths. Our CSP performance metrics can be then utilized to evaluate the large set of existing and emerging CSP algorithms, thereby alleviating the burden of manual inspection on a case-by-case basis.

It exploits the intelligent power of machine learning methods in massive materials data from experiments or simulations to seek for new materials, functionality, principles, etc. Developing specialized facility to generate, collect, manage, learn and mine large-scale materials data is crucial to materials informatics. We herein developed an artificial-intelligence-aided data-driven infrastructure named Jilin Artificial-intelligence aided Materials-design Integrated Package (JAMIP), which is an open-source Python framework to meet the research requirements of computational materials informatics. It is integrated by materials production factory, high-throughput first-principles calculations engine, automatic tasks submission and monitoring progress, data extraction, management and storage system, and artificial intelligence machine learning based data mining functions. We have integrated specific features such as inorganic crystal structure prototype database to facilitate high-throughput calculations and essential modules associated with machine learning studies of functional materials. We demonstrated how our developed code is useful in exploring materials informatics of optoelectronic semiconductors by taking halide perovskites as typical case. By obeying the principles of automation, extensibility, reliability and intelligence, the JAMIP code is a promisingly powerful tool contributing to the fast-growing field of computational materials informatics.",

    "summary": "Crystal structure prediction is a central problem of theoretical crystallography and materials science, which until mid-2000s was considered intractable. Several methods, based on either energy landscape exploration$^{1,2}$ or, more commonly, global optimization$^{3-8}$, largely solved this problem and enabled fully non-empirical computational materials discovery$^{9,10}$. A major shortcoming is that, to avoid expensive calculations of the entropy, crystal structure prediction was done at zero Kelvin and searched for the global minimum of the enthalpy, rather than free energy. As a consequence, high-temperature phases (especially those which are not quenchable to zero temperature) could be missed. Here we develop an accurate and affordable solution, enabling crystal structure prediction at finite temperatures. Structure relaxation and fully anharmonic free energy calculations are done by molecular dynamics with a force field (which can be anything from a parametric force field for simpler cases to a trained on-the-fly machine learning interatomic potential), the errors of which are corrected using thermodynamic perturbation theory to yield accurate ab initio results. We test the accuracy of this method on metals (probing the P-T phase diagram of Al and Fe), a refractory intermetallide (WB), and a significantly ionic ceramic compound (Earth-forming silicate MgSiO3 at pressures and temperatures of the Earth's lower mantle). We find that the hcp-phase of aluminum has a wider stability field than previously thought, and the temperature-induced transition $α$-$β$ in WB occurs at 2789 K. It is also found that iron has hcp structure at conditions of the Earth's inner core, and the much debated (and important for constraining Earth's thermal structure) Clapeyron slope of the post-perovskite phase transition in MgSiO3 is 5.88 MPa/K.",

    "summary": "Electrides, with their excess electrons distributed in crystal cavities playing the role of anions, exhibit a variety of unique electronic and magnetic properties. In this work, we employ the first-principles crystal structure prediction to identify a new prototype of A$_3$B electride in which both interlayer spacings and intralayer vacancies provide channels to accommodate the excess electrons in the crystal. This A$_3$B type of structure is calculated to be thermodynamically stable for two alkaline metals oxides (Rb$_3$O and K$_3$O). Remarkably, the unique feature of multiple types of cavities makes the spatial arrangement of anionic electrons highly flexible via elastic strain engineering and chemical substitution, in contrast to the previously reported electrides characterized by a single topology of interstitial electrons. More importantly, our first-principles calculations reveal that Rb$_3$O is a topological Dirac nodal line semimetal, which is induced by the Rb-$s$ $\\rightarrow$ O-$p$ band inversion at the general electronic k momentums in the Brillouin zone associated with the intersitial electric charges. The discovery of flexible electride in combining with topological electronic properties opens an avenue for electride design and shows great promises in electronic device applications.",

Specifically, we will be concerned with data generated by density-functional theory calculations. At first, we demonstrate that SGD can identify physically meaningful models that classify the crystal structures of 82 octet binary semiconductors as either rocksalt or zincblende. SGD identifies an interpretable two-dimensional model derived from only the atomic radii of valence s and p orbitals that properly classifies the crystal structures for 79 of the 82 octet binary semiconductors. The SGD framework is subsequently applied to 24 400 configurations of neutral gas-phase gold clusters with 5 to 14 atoms to discern general patterns between geometrical and physicochemical properties. For example, SGD helps find that van der Waals interactions within gold clusters are linearly correlated with their radius of gyration and are weaker for planar clusters than for nonplanar clusters. Also, a descriptor that predicts a local linear correlation between the chemical hardness and the cluster isomer stability is found for the even-sized gold clusters.",

Here, we present a bottom-up approach based on self-assembly to engineer three-dimensional photonic and phononic crystals with topologically protected Weyl points. In addition to angular and frequency selectivity of their bulk optical response, Weyl materials are endowed with topological surface states, which allows for the existence of one-way channels even in the presence of time-reversal invariance. Using a combination of group-theoretical methods and numerical simulations, we identify the general symmetry constraints that a self-assembled structure has to satisfy in order to host Weyl points, and describe how to achieve such constraints using a symmetry-driven pipeline for self-assembled material design and discovery. We illustrate our general approach using block copolymer self-assembly as a model system.",

These capabilities are vital for developing advanced technologies across fields such as energy, electronics, and biomedicine, potentially reducing the time and resources needed for new material exploration and promoting rapid innovation cycles. Recent efforts have focused on employing advanced ML algorithms, including deep learning - based graph neural network, for property prediction. Additionally, ensemble models have proven to enhance the generalizability and robustness of ML and DL. However, the use of such ensemble strategies in deep graph networks for material property prediction remains underexplored. Our research provides an in-depth evaluation of ensemble strategies in deep learning - based graph neural network, specifically targeting material property prediction tasks. By testing the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN) and its multitask version, MT-CGCNN, we demonstrated that ensemble techniques, especially prediction averaging, substantially improve precision beyond traditional metrics for key properties like formation energy per atom ($ΔE^{f}$), band gap ($E_{g}$) and density ($ρ$) in 33,990 stable inorganic materials. These findings support the broader application of ensemble methods to enhance predictive accuracy in the field.",

    "summary": "Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves \"conflicted\" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD < 2 Å) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.",

    "summary": "Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.",

    "summary": "Solar-energy plays an important role in solving serious environmental problems and meeting high-energy demand. However, the lack of suitable materials hinders further progress of this technology. Here, we present the largest inorganic solar-cell material search to date using density functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning approaches. We calculated the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) using Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential for 5097 non-metallic materials and identified 1997 candidates with an SLME higher than 10%, including 934 candidates with suitable convex-hull stability and effective carrier mass. Screening for 2D-layered cases, we found 58 potential materials and performed G0W0 calculations on a subset to estimate the prediction-uncertainty. As the above DFT methods are still computationally expensive, we developed a high accuracy machine learning model to pre-screen efficient materials and applied it to over a million materials. Our results provide a general framework and universal strategy for the design of high-efficiency solar cell materials.

    "summary": "Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors ($\\text{CsV}_3\\text{Sb}_5$, $ \\text{Zr}_{16}\\text{Rh}_8\\text{O}_4$ and $\\text{Zr}_{16}\\text{Pd}_8\\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature predictions and structure generations. For instance, on $\\text{CsV}_3\\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast, conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times slower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our approach for advancing materials science research and development.",

    "summary": "Electrides are ionic solids that consist of cationic frameworks and anionic electrons trapped in the voids of lattices. Organic electrides exist in a large abundance, but the thermal instability at room temperature and sensitivity to moisture are bottlenecks that limit their practical uses. Known inorganic electrides are rare but appear to have high thermal and chemical stability and exhibit promising applications as electron-emitting materials, superior catalysts and strong reducing agents. Here, we report a developed inverse-design method that can be used to search for a large variety of inorganic electrides. Our method utilizes the intrinsic property of interstitial electron localization of electrides as the global variable function being incorporated into the swarm-intelligence based structure searches. Through screening 99 binary ionic compounds, we have designed 89 new inorganic electrides that are classified into three-, two-, and zero-dimensional species according to the way that the interstitial electrons are localized and the conductive properties of the systems. Our work reveals the rich abundance of inorganic electrides by extending them into more general forms and provides new structure types for electrides that are not thought of as before.",

This manuscript provides a broad and comprehensive overview of recent trends where predictive modeling capabilities are developed in conjunction with experiments and advanced characterization to gain a greater insight into structure-properties relationships and study various physical phenomena and mechanisms. The focus of this review is on the intersections of multiscale materials experiments and modeling relevant to the materials mechanics community. After a general discussion on the perspective from various communities, the article focuses on the latest experimental and theoretical opportunities. Emphasis is given to the role of experiments in multiscale models, including insights into how computations can be used as discovery tools for materials engineering, rather than to \"simply\" support experimental work. This is illustrated by examples from several application areas on structural materials. This manuscript ends with a discussion on some problems and open scientific questions that are being explored in order to advance this relatively new field of research.",

Using this algorithm, we systematically screen all possible polar-nonpolar structure pairs from the entire Materials Project database and establish a database of $\\sim$4500 pairs that possess a close symmetry relation. These pairs can be connected through a continuous phase transition with small atomic displacements. From this database, we identify several new ferroelectric materials that have never been reported in the past. In addition to the screening of ferroelectric materials, the symmetry relation database may also be used for other areas, such as material structure prediction and new materials discovery.",

    "summary": "The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful. However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models. Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap, energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of 40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is prohibitively expensive.",

The main challenge is that the number of local minima grows exponentially with system size. In this work, we proposed two crossover-mutation schemes based on graph theory to accelerate the evolutionary structure searching. These schemes can detect molecules or clusters inside periodic networks using quotient graphs for crystals and the decomposition can dramatically reduce the searching space. Sufficient examples for the test, including the high pressure phases of methane, ammonia, MgAl2O4, and boron, show that these new evolution schemes can obviously improve the success rate and searching efficiency compared with the standard method in both isolated and extended systems.",

We show the potential of this technique by predicting precursors for two perovskite materials, using only training data published over a decade prior to their first reported syntheses. We demonstrate that the model learns representations of materials corresponding to synthesis-related properties, and that the model's behavior complements existing thermodynamic knowledge. Finally, we apply the model to perform synthesizability screening for proposed novel perovskite compounds.",

    "summary": "High-throughput screening has become one of the major strategies for the discovery of novel functional materials. However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of quantity and diversity of known materials deposited in the current materials repositories such as ICSD and OQMD. Recent progress in machine learning and especially deep learning have enabled a generative strategy that learns implicit chemical rules for creating chemically valid hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generation of novel cubic crystal structures. When trained on 375,749 ternary crystal materials from the OQMD database, we show that our model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such new materials (all of them are either ternary or quarternary) have been verified by DFT based phonon dispersion stability check, several of which have been found to potentially have exceptional functional properties.

    "summary": "Crystal structures can be viewed as assemblies of space-filling polyhedra, which play a critical role in determining material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant. However, most conventional crystal structure prediction methods rely on random structure generation and do not explicitly incorporate polyhedral tiling, limiting their efficiency and interpretability. In this highlight, we introduced a novel crystal structure generation method based on discrete geometric analysis of polyhedral information. The geometry and topology of space-filling polyhedra are encoded as a dual periodic graph, and the corresponding crystal structure is obtained via the standard realization of this graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing face-centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and body-centered cubic (BCC) structures from their dual periodic graphs. This method offers a new pathway for systematically generating crystal structures based on target polyhedra, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel materials for applications in electronics, energy storage, and beyond.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made, successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures). Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations, and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly available to the community.",

    "summary": "Evolutionary crystal structure prediction proved to be a powerful approach for studying a wide range of materials. Here, we present a specifically designed algorithm for the prediction of the structure of complex crystals consisting of well-defined molecular units. The main feature of this new approach is that each unit is treated as a whole body, which drastically reduces the search space and improves the efficiency, but necessitates the introduction of new variation operators described here. To increase diversity of the population of structures, the initial population and part($\\scriptsize{\\sim}$20%) of the new generations are generated using space group symmetry combined with random cell parameters and random positions and orientations of molecular units. We illustrate the efficiency and reliability of this approach by number of tests (ice, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane, benzene, glycine and butane-1,4-diammonium dibromide). This approach easily predicts the crystal structure of methane \\emph{A} containing 21 methane molecules (105 atoms) per unit cell. We demonstrate that this new approach has also a high potential for the study of complex inorganic crystals on the examples of a complex hydrogen storage material Mg(BH$_4$)$_2$ and elemental boron.",

This work reports the development of a robust and efficient method for assessing the similarity of structures on the basis of their interatomic distances. Using this method, we proposed a simple and unambiguous definition of crystal structure prototype based on hierarchical clustering theory, and constructed the Crystal Structure Prototype Database (CSPD) by filtering the known crystallographic structures in a database. With similar method, a program Structure Prototype Analysis Package (SPAP) was developed to remove similar structures in CALYPSO prediction results and extract predicted low energy structures for a separate theoretical structure database. A series of statistics describing the distribution of crystal structure prototypes in the CSPD was compiled to provide an important insight for structure prediction and high-throughput calculations. Illustrative examples of the application of the proposed database are given, including the generation of initial structures for structure prediction and determination of the prototype structure in databases. These examples demonstrate the CSPD to be a generally applicable and useful tool for materials discovery.",

The theory produces a rapidly convergent Neumann-series that, upon Gaussian closure via a Hermite expansion, yields closed-form first-, second- and third-order approximations, which achieve percent-level accuracy at first order for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, second-order approximations achieve sub-2% accuracy across a wide range of local property contrasts and correlations. Our formalism provides mathematically rigorous structure-property closures, with significant implications for the discovery and design of novel graded and architected materials with tailored transport properties.",

To mitigate the challenge of incorporating large-scale assessment on the reliability of generated structures into the training process, we utilize the generative adversarial network (GAN) with its discriminator being a cost-effective evaluator for the generated structures, resulting in notable improvements in model performance. We demonstrate the utility of our model in finding the optimal crystal structure under predefined conditions. Without reliance on properties acquired experimentally or numerically, our model further displays its capability to comprehend the mechanism of crystal structure formation through its ability to grouping chemically similar elements. Therefore, this paper extends an invitation to explore deeper into the scientific understanding of material structures through generative models, offering a fresh perspective on broadening the scope and efficacy of machine learning in material science.",

Therefore, the ability to extrapolate to out-of-distribution (OOD) property values is critical for both solid-state materials and molecular design. Our objective is to train predictor models that extrapolate zero-shot to higher ranges than in the training data, given the chemical compositions of solids or molecular graphs and their property values. We propose using a transductive approach to OOD property prediction, achieving improvements in prediction accuracy. In particular, the True Positive Rate (TPR) of OOD classification of materials and molecules improved by 3x and 2.5x, respectively, and precision improved by 2x and 1.5x compared to non-transductive baselines. Our method leverages analogical input-target relations in the training and test sets, enabling generalization beyond the training target support, and can be applied to any other material and molecular tasks.",

Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current and potential applications.\n  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also, missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials, suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.",

In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (< 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Thirteen are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state among the collinear configurations considered. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 of the screened materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA exceed 0.2 under the approximation of collinear magnetism. Notably, Ag2Pt2O7 exhibits a high AHA of 0.405 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.",

Among the characterized properties of the missing compounds are potential transparent conductors, thermoelectric materials and topological semimetals. This integrated process-prediction of functionality in unreported compounds followed by laboratory synthesis and characterization-could be a route to the systematic discovery of hitherto missing, realizable functional materials.",

Motivated by the early work of Buerger (1951), here we investigate the routes to predict kinetics of polymorphic transformations using solely crystallographic arguments. As part of this investigation we developed a general algorithm to map crystal structures onto each other and construct transformation pathways between them. The developed algorithm reproduces reliably known transformation pathways and reveals the critical role that the dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway plays in choosing the best (low-energy barrier) mapping. By utilizing our structure-mapping algorithm we were able to quantitatively demonstrate the intuitive expectation that the minimal dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway, or in ionic systems, the condition of coordination of atoms along the pathway not decreasing below the coordination in the end compounds, represents the requirement for fast transformation kinetics. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the structure-mapping algorithm in combination with the coordination analysis in studying transformations between polymorphs for which a detailed atomic-level picture is presently elusive.",

    "summary": "The discovery and optimization of high-energy materials (HEMs) are constrained by the prohibitive computational expense and prolonged development cycles inherent in conventional approaches. In this work, we develop a general neural network potential (NNP) that efficiently predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs composed of C, H, N, and O. Our framework leverages pre-trained NNP models, fine-tuned using transfer learning on energy and force data derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy enables rapid adaptation across 20 different HEM systems while maintaining DFT-level accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of this work is the ability of NNP model to capture the chemical activity space of HEMs, accurately describe the key atomic interactions and reaction mechanisms during thermal decomposition. The general NNP model has been applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and validated with experimental data for various HEM structures. Results show that the NNP model accurately predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs by effectively describing their chemical activity space. Compared to traditional force fields, it offers superior DFT-level accuracy and generalization across both microscopic and macroscopic properties, reducing the computational and experimental costs. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design and development of HEMs and proposes a promising framework for integrating DFT, machine learning, and experimental methods in materials research. (To facilitate further research and practical applications, we open-source our NNP model on GitHub: https://github.com/MingjieWen/General-NNP-model-for-C-H-N-O-Energetic-Materials.)",

However, traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient due to the vast search space. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled generative models to predict new stable materials by incorporating structural symmetries and to condition the generation on desired properties. In this work, we introduce SymmBFN, a novel symmetry-aware Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) for crystalline material generation that accurately reproduces the distribution of space groups found in experimentally observed crystals. SymmBFN substantially improves efficiency, generating stable structures at least 50 times faster than the next-best method. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability for property-conditioned generation, enabling the design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings establish BFNs as an effective tool for accelerating the discovery of crystalline materials.",

Yet, to date, limited models are available to fully explore sequence-property relationships for analysis and design. Here we propose a custom generative large-language model to enable design of novel spider silk protein sequences to meet complex combinations of target mechanical properties. The model, pretrained on a large set of protein sequences, is fine-tuned on ~1,000 major ampullate spidroin (MaSp) sequences for which associated fiber-level mechanical properties exist, to yield an end-to-end forward and inverse generative strategy. Performance is assessed through: (1), a novelty analysis and protein type classification for generated spidroin sequences through BLAST searches, (2) property evaluation and comparison with similar sequences, (3) comparison of molecular structures, as well as, and (4) a detailed sequence motif analyses. We generate silk sequences with property combinations that do not exist in nature, and develop a deep understanding the mechanistic roles of sequence patterns in achieving overarching key mechanical properties (elastic modulus, strength, toughness, failure strain). The model provides an efficient approach to expand the silkome dataset, facilitating further sequence-structure analyses of silks, and establishes a foundation for synthetic silk design and optimization.",

However, first-principles computation of optical properties from crystal structures is a complex task due to the high convergence criteria and computational cost. Recent progress in machine learning shows promise in predicting material properties, yet predicting optical properties from crystal structures remains challenging due to the lack of efficient atomic embeddings. Here, we introduce GNNOpt, an equivariance graph-neural-network architecture featuring automatic embedding optimization. This enables high-quality optical predictions with a dataset of only 944 materials. GNNOpt predicts all optical properties based on the Kramers-Kr{ö}nig relations, including absorption coefficient, complex dielectric function, complex refractive index, and reflectance. We apply the trained model to screen photovoltaic materials based on spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency and search for quantum materials based on quantum weight. First-principles calculations validate the efficacy of the GNNOpt model, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the optical spectra of unseen materials. The discovery of new quantum materials with high predicted quantum weight, such as SiOs which hosts exotic quasiparticles, demonstrates GNNOpt's potential in predicting optical properties across a broad range of materials and applications.",

Recently, generative deep learning (DL) networks are considered as the state-of-the-art in inverse chemical design and have achieved early success in generating molecular structures with desired properties in the pharmaceutical and material chemistry fields. However, satisfying a large number (larger than 10 objectives) of molecular objectives is a limitation of current generative models. To improve the model's ability to handle a large number of molecule design objectives, we developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based generative framework to optimize chemical molecule generation. Our use of Curriculum Learning (CL) to fine-tune the pre-trained generative network allowed the model to satisfy up to 21 objectives and increase the generative network's robustness. The experiments show that the proposed multiple-objective RL-based generative model can correctly identify unknown molecules with an 83 to 100 percent success rate, compared to the baseline approach of 0 percent. Additionally, this proposed generative model is not limited to just chemistry research challenges; we anticipate that problems that utilize RL with multiple-objectives will benefit from this framework.",

In the discriminative approach dubbed forward design, the goal is to map a set of features/molecules to their respective electronics properties. In the generative approach dubbed inverse design, a set of electronics properties is given and the goal is to find the features/molecules that have these properties. These tasks are very challenging because the chemical compound space is very large. In this study, we explore a new scheme for the inverse design of molecules based on a classification paradigm that takes as input the targeted electronic properties and output the atomic composition of the molecules (i.e. atomicity or atom counts of each type in a molecule). To test this new hypothesis, we analyzed the quantum mechanics QM7b dataset consisting of 7211 small organic molecules and 14 electronic properties. Results obtained using twenty three different classification approaches including a regularized Bayesian neural network show that it is possible to achieve detection/prediction accuracy > 90%.",

Synthesis of a material is a complex process that depends not only on its thermodynamic stability with respect to others, but also on factors from kinetics, to advances in synthesis techniques, to the availability of precursors. This complexity makes the development of a general theory or first-principles approach to synthesizability currently impractical. Here we show how an alternative pathway to predicting synthesizability emerges from the dynamics of the materials stability network: a scale-free network constructed by combining the convex free-energy surface of inorganic materials computed by high-throughput density functional theory and their experimental discovery timelines extracted from citations. The time-evolution of the underlying network properties allows us to use machine-learning to predict the likelihood that hypothetical, computer-generated materials will be amenable to successful experimental synthesis.",

    "summary": "The electronic properties of transition-metal oxides with highly correlated electrons are of central importance in modern condensed matter physics and chemistry, both for their fundamental scientific interest, and for their potential for advanced electronic applications. The design of materials with tailored properties has been, however, restricted by the limited understanding of their structure-property relationships, which are particularly complex in the proximity of the regime where localized electrons become gradually mobile. RENiO3 perovskites, characterized by the presence of spontaneous metal to insulator transitions, are one of the most widely used model materials for the investigation of this region in theoretical studies. However, crucial experimental information needed to validate theoretical predictions is still lacking due to their challenging high-pressure synthesis, which has prevented to date the growth of sizable bulk single crystals with RE different than La, Pr and Nd. Here we report the first successful growth of single crystals with RE = Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Y, Ho, Er and Lu and sizes up to ~75 μm, grown from molten salts in temperature gradient under 2000 bar oxygen gas pressure. The crystals display regular prismatic shapes with flat facets, and their crystal structures, metal-insulator and antiferromagnetic order transition temperatures are in excellent agreement with previously reported values obtained from polycrystalline samples. The availability of such crystals opens access to measurements that have hitherto been impossible to conduct. This should contribute to a better understanding of the fascinating properties of materials with highly correlated electrons, and guide future efforts to engineer transition metal oxides with tailored functional properties.",

Conventionally, the needle-in-a-haystack search for the few experimentally-synthesizable compounds is performed using a convex hull construction, which identifies structures stabilized by manipulation of a particular thermodynamic constraint (for example pressure or composition) chosen based on prior experimental evidence or intuition. To address the biased nature of this procedure we introduce a generalized convex hull framework. Convex hulls are constructed on data-driven principal coordinates, which represent the full structural diversity of the database. Their coupling to experimentally-realizable constraints hints at the conditions that are most likely to stabilize a given configuration. The probabilistic nature of our framework also addresses the uncertainty stemming from the use of approximate models during database construction, and eliminates redundant structures. The remaining small set of candidates that have a high probability of being synthesizable provide a much needed starting point for the determination of viable synthetic pathways.",

Recent advances have shown that machine learning can be used to learn such relationships, allowing the stability and functional properties of materials to be accurately predicted. However, most of these approaches use atomic coordinates as input and are thus bottle-necked by crystal structure identification when investigating novel materials. Our approach solves this bottleneck by coarse-graining the infinite search space of atomic coordinates into a combinatorially enumerable search space. The key idea is to use Wyckoff representations -- coordinate-free sets of symmetry-related positions in a crystal -- as the input to a machine learning model. Our model demonstrates exceptionally high precision in discovering new theoretically stable materials, identifying 1,569 materials that lie below the known convex hull of previously calculated materials from just 5,675 ab-initio calculations. Our approach opens up fundamental advances in computational materials discovery.",

However, obtaining equilibrium crystal structures typically requires expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which limits ML-based exploration to either known crystals or a small number of hypothetical crystals. Here, we demonstrate that the application of Bayesian optimization with symmetry constraints using a graph deep learning energy model can be used to perform \"DFT-free\" relaxations of crystal structures. Using this approach to significantly improve the accuracy of ML-predicted formation energies and elastic moduli of hypothetical crystals, two novel ultra-incompressible hard materials MoWC2 (P63/mmc) and ReWB (Pca21) were identified and successfully synthesized via in-situ reactive spark plasma sintering from a screening of 399,960 transition metal borides and carbides. This work addresses a critical bottleneck to accurate property predictions for hypothetical materials, paving the way to ML-accelerated discovery of new materials with exceptional properties.",

    "summary": "Graph neural networks trained on large crystal structure databases are extremely effective in replacing ab initio calculations in the discovery and characterization of materials. However, crystal structure datasets comprising millions of materials exist only for the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning to extend these models to other density functionals. We show that pre-training significantly reduces the size of the dataset required to achieve chemical accuracy and beyond. We also analyze in detail the relationship between the transfer-learning performance and the size of the datasets used for the initial training of the model and transfer learning. We confirm a linear dependence of the error on the size of the datasets on a log-log scale, with a similar slope for both training and the pre-training datasets. This shows that further increasing the size of the pre-training dataset, i.e. performing additional calculations with a low-cost functional, is also effective, through transfer learning, in improving machine-learning predictions with the quality of a more accurate, and possibly computationally more involved functional. Lastly, we compare the efficacy of interproperty and intraproperty transfer learning.",

    "summary": "Anisotropy in crystals plays a pivotal role in many technological applications. For example, anisotropic electronic and thermal transport are thought to be beneficial for thermoelectric applications, while anisotropic mechanical properties are of interest for emerging metamaterials, and anisotropic dielectric materials have been suggested as a novel platform for dark matter detection. Understanding and tailoring anisotropy in crystals is therefore essential for the design of next-generation functional materials. To date, however, most data-driven approaches have focused on the prediction of scalar crystal properties, such as the spherically averaged dielectric tensor or the bulk and shear elastic moduli. Here, we adopt the latest approaches in equivariant graph neural networks to develop a model that can predict the full dielectric tensor of crystals. Our model, trained on the Materials Project dataset of c.a. 6,700 dielectric tensors, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in scalar dielectric prediction in addition to capturing the directional response. We showcase the performance of the model by discovering crystals with almost isotropic connectivity but highly anisotropic dielectric tensors, thereby broadening our knowledge of the structure-property relationships in dielectric crystals.",

The full mechanism still needs clarification and research often focuses on laboratory work. As such, there is interest in causal discovery to confirm the significance of factors and identify potential missing causal relationships or co-dependencies between these factors. The causal discovery algorithm Fast Causal Inference (FCI) has been trialled on a small set of laboratory data, with the outputs evaluated for their significance to corrosion propagation, and compared to existing mechanistic understanding. FCI identified the salt deposition flux as the most influential corrosion variable for this limited dataset. However, HCl was the second most influential for pitting regions, compared to temperature for more uniformly corroding regions. Thus FCI generated causal links aligned with literature from a randomised corrosion dataset, while also identifying the presence of two different degradation modes in operation.",

    "summary": "Oxide Li-conducting solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer excellent chemical and thermal stability but typically exhibit lower ionic conductivity than sulfides and chlorides. This motivates the search for new oxide materials with enhanced conductivity. Crystal structure prediction is a powerful approach for identifying such candidates. However, the structural complexity of oxide SSEs, often involving unit cells with more than 100 atoms, presents significant challenges for conventional methods. In this study, we introduce TOPIC, a structure prediction algorithm that reduces configurational complexity by enforcing corner-sharing (CS) bond topology constraints. We demonstrate that TOPIC successfully reproduces the ground-state and metastable structures of known oxide SSEs, including LiTa$_2$PO$_8$ and Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, which contain up to about 200 atoms per unit cell. By combining this approach with a pretrained machine-learning interatomic potential, we systematically screen quaternary oxide compositions and identify 92 promising candidates with CS frameworks. In particular, Li$_4$Hf$_2$Si$_3$O$_{12}$, which corresponds to the ground state at its composition, exhibits an ionic conductivity of 14 mS cm$^{-1}$, a hull energy of 21 meV atom$^{-1}$, and a band gap of 6.5 eV. Through our investigation, we identify the Li ratio as one of the key factors determining the stability of CS structures. Overall, our approach provides a practical and scalable pathway for discovering high-performance oxide solid electrolytes in previously unexplored chemical spaces.",

    "summary": "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful and popular tool for understanding the dynamical evolution of materials at the nano and mesoscopic scales. There are various flavors of MD ranging from the high fidelity albeit computationally expensive ab-initio MD to relatively lower fidelity but much more efficient classical MD such as atomistic and coarse-grained models. Each of these different flavors of MD have been independently used by materials scientists to bring about breakthroughs in materials discovery and design. A significant gulf exists between the various MD flavors, each having varying levels of fidelity. The accuracy of DFT or ab-initio MD is generally much higher than that of classical atomistic simulations which is higher than that of coarse-grained models. Multi-fidelity scale bridging to combine the accuracy and flexibility of ab-initio MD with efficiency classical MD has been a longstanding goal. The advent of big-data analytics has brought to the forefront powerful machine learning methods that can be deployed to achieve this goal. Here, we provide our perspective on the challenges in multi-fidelity scale bridging and trace the developments leading up to the use of machine learning algorithms and data-science towards addressing this grand challenge.",

    "summary": "Property prediction is a fundamental task in crystal material research. To model atoms and structures, structures represented as graphs are widely used and graph learning-based methods have achieved significant progress. Bond angles and bond distances are two key structural information that greatly influence crystal properties. However, most of the existing works only consider bond distances and overlook bond angles. The main challenge lies in the time cost of handling bond angles, which leads to a significant increase in inference time. To solve this issue, we first propose a crystal structure modeling based on dual scale neighbor partitioning mechanism, which uses a larger scale cutoff for edge neighbors and a smaller scale cutoff for angle neighbors. Then, we propose a novel Atom-Distance-Angle Graph Neural Network (ADA-GNN) for property prediction tasks, which can process node information and structural information separately. The accuracy of predictions and inference time are improved with the dual scale modeling and the specially designed architecture of ADA-GNN. The experimental results validate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in two large-scale material benchmark datasets on property prediction tasks.",

    "summary": "Low dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) represent a promising class of electronically active materials for both light absorption and emission. The design space of HOIPs is extremely large, since a diverse space of organic cations can be combined with different inorganic frameworks. This immense design space allows for tunable electronic and mechanical properties, but also necessitates the development of new tools for in silico high throughput analysis of candidate structures. In this work, we present an accurate, efficient, transferable and widely applicable machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for predicting the structure of new 2D HOIPs. Using the MACE architecture, an MLIP is trained on 86 diverse experimentally reported HOIP structures. The model is tested on 73 unseen perovskite compositions, and achieves chemical accuracy with respect to the reference electronic structure method. Our model is then combined with a simple random structure search algorithm to predict the structure of hypothetical HOIPs given only the proposed composition. Success is demonstrated by correctly and reliably recovering the crystal structure of a set of experimentally known 2D perovskites. Such a random structure search is impossible with ab initio methods due to the associated computational cost, but is relatively inexpensive with the MACE potential. Finally, the procedure is used to predict the structure formed by a new organic cation with no previously known corresponding perovskite. Laboratory synthesis of the new hybrid perovskite confirms the accuracy of our prediction. This capability, applied at scale, enables efficient screening of thousands of combinations of organic cations and inorganic layers.",

    "summary": "Developing accurate, transferable and computationally inexpensive machine learning models can rapidly accelerate the discovery and development of new materials. Some of the major challenges involved in developing such models are, (i) limited availability of materials data as compared to other fields, (ii) lack of universal descriptor of materials to predict its various properties. The limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer learning, while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and Grossman [1], where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals. In this work, we develop a new model (MT-CGCNN) by integrating CGCNN with transfer learning based on multi-task (MT) learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-CGCNN by simultaneous prediction of various material properties such as Formation Energy, Band Gap and Fermi Energy for a wide range of inorganic crystals (46774 materials). MT-CGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on correlated properties by upto 8%. The model prediction has lower test error compared to CGCNN, even when the training data is reduced by 10%. We also demonstrate our model's better performance through prediction of end user scenario related to metal/non-metal classification. These results encourage further development of machine learning approaches which leverage multi-task learning to address the aforementioned challenges in the discovery of new materials. We make MT-CGCNN's source code available to encourage reproducible research.",

Interestingly, here we propose a generic approach to convert 2D semiconductors, which are amply abundant, to 2D topological insulators (TIs), which are less available, via selective atomic adsorption and strain engineering. The approach is underlined by an orbital design principle that involves introducing an extrinsic s-orbital state into the intrinsic sp-bands of a 2D semiconductor, so as to induce s-p band inversion for a TI phase, as demonstrated by tight-binding model analyses. Remarkably, based on first-principles calculations, we apply this approach to convert the semiconducting monolayer CuS and CuTe into a TI by adsorbing Na and K respectively with a proper s-level energy, and CuSe into a TI by adsorbing a mixture of Na and K with a tuned s-level energy or by adsorbing either Na or K on a strained CuSe with a tuned p-level valence band edge. Our findings open a new door to the discovery of TIs by a predictive materials design, beyond finding a preexisting 2D TI.",

    "summary": "Geometric machine learning models such as graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in recent years in chemical and materials science research for applications such as high-throughput virtual screening and atomistic simulations. The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.",

The 5967 samples of ternary LATX materials that are collected are then used as the host structures. For each host crystal structure, a substituted crystal structure is created by substituting all lanthanide sites with Nd, all transition metal sites with Fe, and all light element sites with B. High throughput first-principles calculations are applied to evaluate the phase stability of the newly created crystal structures, and 20 of them are found to be potentially formable. A data driven approach based on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques is applied to estimate the stability and analyze the structure stability relationship of the newly created NdFeB crystal structures. For predicting the stability for the newly created NdFeB structures, three supervised learning models, kernel ridge regression, logistic classification, and decision tree model, are learned from the LATX host crystal structures; the models achieve the maximum accuracy and recall scores of 70.4 and 68.7 percent, respectively. On the other hand, our proposed unsupervised learning model based on the integration of descriptor-relevance analysis and a Gaussian mixture model achieves accuracy and recall score of 72.9 and 82.1 percent, respectively, which are significantly better than those of the supervised models. While capturing and interpreting the structure stability relationship of the NdFeB crystal structures, the unsupervised learning model indicates that the average atomic coordination number and coordination number of the Fe sites are the most important factors in determining the phase stability of the new substituted NdFeB crystal structures.",

Traditional electronic structure methods require expensive computation time and memory consumption, thus a fast and accurate prediction model is desired with increasing importance. Representing the interactions among atomic orbitals in any material, a material Hamiltonian provides all the essential elements that control the structure-property correlations in inorganic compounds. Effective learning of material Hamiltonian by developing machine learning methodologies therefore offers a transformative approach to accelerate the discovery and design of quantum materials. With this motivation, we present and compare several different graph convolution networks that are able to predict the band gap for inorganic materials. The models are developed to incorporate two different features: the information of each orbital itself and the interaction between each other. The information of each orbital includes the name, relative coordinates with respect to the center of super cell and the atom number, while the interaction between orbitals are represented by the Hamiltonian matrix. The results show that our model can get a promising prediction accuracy with cross-validation.",

    "summary": "Rare earth (RE)-free permanent magnets, as alternative substitutes for RE-containing magnets for sustainable energy technologies and modern electronics, have attracted considerable interest. We performed a comprehensive search for new hard magnetic materials in the ternary Fe-Co-Zr space by leveraging a scalable, machine learning-assisted materials discovery framework running on GPU-enabled exascale computing resources. This framework integrates crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently navigate the vast composition-structure space. The efficiency and accuracy of the ML approach enable us to reveal 9 new thermodynamically stable ternary Fe-Co-Zr compounds and 81 promising low-energy metastable phases with their formation energies within 0.1 eV/atom above the convex hull. The predicted compounds span a wide range of crystal symmetries and magnetic behaviors, providing a rich platform for tuning functional properties. Based on the analysis of site-specific magnetic properties, we show that the Fe6Co17Zr6 compound obtained from our ML discovery can be further optimized by chemical doping. Chemical substitutions lead to a ternary Fe5Co18Zr6 phase with a strong anisotropy of K1 = 1.1 MJ/m3, and a stable quaternary magnetic Fe5Co16Zr6Mn4 compound.",

    "summary": "We extend the scope of our approach for unsupervised automated discovery of material laws (EUCLID) to the case of a material belonging to an unknown class of behavior. To this end, we leverage the theory of generalized standard materials, which encompasses a plethora of important constitutive classes. We show that, based only on full-field kinematic measurements and net reaction forces, EUCLID is able to automatically discover the two scalar thermodynamic potentials, namely, the Helmholtz free energy and the dissipation potential, which completely define the behavior of generalized standard materials. The a priori enforced constraint of convexity on these potentials guarantees by construction stability and thermodynamic consistency of the discovered model; balance of linear momentum acts as a fundamental constraint to replace the availability of stress-strain labeled pairs; sparsity promoting regularization enables the automatic selection of a small subset from a possibly large number of candidate model features and thus leads to a parsimonious, i.e., simple and interpretable, model. Importantly, since model features go hand in hand with the correspondingly active internal variables, sparse regression automatically induces a parsimonious selection of the few internal variables needed for an accurate but simple description of the material behavior. A fully automatic procedure leads to the selection of the hyperparameter controlling the weight of the sparsity promoting regularization term, in order to strike a user-defined balance between model accuracy and simplicity. By testing the method on synthetic data including artificial noise, we demonstrate that EUCLID is able to automatically discover the true hidden material model from a large catalog of constitutive classes, including elasticity, viscoelasticity, elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity, isotropic and kinematic hardening.",

    "summary": "The inverse problem of designing component interactions to target emergent structure is fundamental to numerous applications in biotechnology, materials science, and statistical physics. Equally important is the inverse problem of designing emergent kinetics, but this has received considerably less attention. Using recent advances in automatic differentiation, we show how kinetic pathways can be precisely designed by directly differentiating through statistical-physics models, namely free energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We consider two systems that are crucial to our understanding of structural self-assembly: bulk crystallization and small nanoclusters. In each case we are able to assemble precise dynamical features. Using gradient information, we manipulate interactions among constituent particles to tune the rate at which these systems yield specific structures of interest. Moreover, we use this approach to learn non-trivial features about the high-dimensional design space, allowing us to accurately predict when multiple kinetic features can be simultaneously and independently controlled. These results provide a concrete and generalizable foundation for studying non-structural self-assembly, including kinetic properties as well as other complex emergent properties, in a vast array of systems.",

Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.",

    "summary": "A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter's butterfly, a fractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal's lattice periodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for predicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter's butterfly are challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those that are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a framework for predicting a material's local Chern markers using its position-space description and validate it against experimental observations of quantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure, inherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk spectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system's topology, we reveal the topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial graphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of this framework by simulating how Hofstadter's butterfly emerges from an initially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system's potential strength is increased, and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator at the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space approach to determine a material's Chern invariant without requiring prior knowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad array of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery, especially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.",

    "summary": "The predictive performance screening of novel compounds can significantly promote the discovery of efficient, cheap, and non-toxic thermoelectric materials. Large efforts to implement machine-learning techniques coupled to materials databases are currently being undertaken, but the adopted computational methods can dramatically affect the outcome. With regards to electronic transport and power factor calculations, the most widely adopted and computationally efficient method, is the constant relaxation time approximation (CRT). This work goes beyond the CRT and adopts the proper, full energy and momentum dependencies of electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering, to compute the electronic transport and perform power factor optimization for a group of half-Heusler alloys. Then the material parameters that determine the optimal power factor based on this more advanced treatment are identified. This enables the development of a set of significantly improved descriptors that can be used in materials screening studies, and which offer deeper insights into the underlying nature of high performance thermoelectric materials. We have identified $n_v$$ε_r$ / $D_o^2m_{cond}$ as the most useful and generic descriptor, a combination of the number of valleys, the dielectric constant, the conductivity effective mass, and the deformation potential for the dominant electron-phonon process. The proposed descriptors can accelerate the discovery of new efficient and environment friendly thermoelectric materials in a much more accurate and reliable manner, and some predictions for very high performance materials are presented.",

    "summary": "The sensitivity of heterogeneous energetic (HE) materials (propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics) is critically dependent on their microstructure. Initiation of chemical reactions occurs at hot spots due to energy localization at sites of porosities and other defects. Emerging multi-scale predictive models of HE response to loads account for the physics at the meso-scale, i.e. at the scale of statistically representative clusters of particles and other features in the microstructure. Meso-scale physics is infused in machine-learned closure models informed by resolved meso-scale simulations. Since microstructures are stochastic, ensembles of meso-scale simulations are required to quantify hot spot ignition and growth and to develop models for microstructure-dependent energy deposition rates. We propose utilizing generative adversarial networks (GAN) to spawn ensembles of synthetic heterogeneous energetic material microstructures. The method generates qualitatively and quantitatively realistic microstructures by learning from images of HE microstructures. We show that the proposed GAN method also permits the generation of new morphologies, where the porosity distribution can be controlled and spatially manipulated. Such control paves the way for the design of novel microstructures to engineer HE materials for targeted performance in a materials-by-design framework.",

    "summary": "Fundamental research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems based on van der Waals materials has been gaining traction rapidly since their recent discovery. With the increase of recent knowledge, it has become clear that such materials have also a strong potential for applications in devices that combine magnetism with electronics, optics, and nanomechanics. Nonetheless, many challenges still lay ahead. Several fundamental aspects of 2D magnetic materials are still unknown or poorly understood, such as their often-complicated electronic structure, optical properties, and magnetization dynamics, and their magnon spectrum. To elucidate their properties and facilitate integration in devices, advanced characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks need to be developed or adapted. Moreover, developing synthesis methods which increase critical temperatures and achieve large-scale, high-quality homogeneous thin films is crucial before these materials can be used for real-world applications. Therefore, the field of 2D magnetic materials provides many challenges and opportunities for the discovery and exploration of new phenomena, as well as the development of new applications. This Roadmap presents the background, challenges, and potential research directions for various relevant topics in the field on the fundamentals, synthesis, characterization, and applications. We hope that this work can provide a strong starting point for young researchers in the field and provide a general overview of the key challenges for more experienced researchers.",

    "summary": "Quantum materials hosting Weyl fermions have opened a new era of research in condensed matter physics. First proposed in 1929 in particle physics, Weyl fermions have yet to be observed as elementary particles. In 2015, Weyl fermions were detected as collective electronic excitations in the strong spin-orbit coupled material tantalum arsenide, TaAs. This discovery was followed by a flurry of experimental and theoretical explorations of Weyl phenomena in materials. Weyl materials naturally lend themselves to the exploration of the topological index associated with Weyl fermions and their divergent Berry curvature field, as well as the topological bulk-boundary correspondence giving rise to protected conducting surface states. Here, we review the broader class of Weyl topological phenomena in materials, starting with the observation of emergent Weyl fermions in the bulk and of Fermi arc states on the surface of the TaAs family of crystals by photoemission spectroscopy. We then discuss some of the exotic optical and magnetic responses observed in these materials, as well as the progress in developing some of the related chiral materials. We discuss the conceptual development of high-fold chiral fermions, which generalize Weyl fermions, and we review the observation of high-fold chiral fermion phases by taking the rhodium silicide, RhSi, family of crystals as a prime example. Lastly, we discuss recent advances in Weyl-line phases in magnetic topological materials. With this Review, we aim to provide an introduction to the basic concepts underlying Weyl physics in condensed matter, and to representative materials and their electronic structures and topology as revealed by spectroscopic studies. We hope this work serves as a guide for future theoretical and experimental explorations of chiral fermions and related topological quantum systems with potentially enhanced functionalities.",

In the UWBG field, aluminum nitride and boron nitride have attracted great interest, however, the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys are much less studied. In this article, using first-principles simulations combining density-functional theory and cluster expansion method we predict the crystal structure of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys. We find 17 ground state structures of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N with formation energies between 0.11 and 0.25 eV/atom. All of these structures are found to be dynamically stable. The B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures are found to have predominantly a tetrahedral bonding environment, however, some structures exhibit $sp^2$ bonds similar to hexagonal BN. This work expands our knowledge of the structures, energies, and bonding in B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N aiding their synthesis, innovation of lateral or vertical devices, and discovery of compatible dielectric and Ohmic contact materials.",

However, a general understanding of how crystal structures affects multiexciton generation processes is lacking, requiring computationally demanding calculations for each material. Here we present an approach to understand and classify such crystals and elucidate multiexciton processes. We show that organic crystals that are composed of two sublattices are well-approximated by effective fictitious systems of higher translational symmetry. Within this framework, we derive hidden selection rules in crystal pentacene and predict that the common bulk polymorph supports fast Coulomb-mediated singlet fission about one order of magnitude more than the thin-film polymorph, a result confirmed with many-body perturbation theory calculations. Our approach is fully based on density-functional theory calculations, and provides design principles for the experimental and computational discovery of new materials with efficient non-radiative exciton decay rates.",

Here, based on first-principles calculations, we reported giant NLMO effects in CrI3-based 2D magnets, including a dramatic change of second-harmonics generation (SHG) polarization direction (90 degrees) and intensity (on/off switch) under magnetization reversal, and a 100% SHG circular dichroism effect. We further revealed that these effects could not only be used to design ultra-thin multifunctional optical devices, but also to detect subtle magnetic orderings. Remarkably, we analytically derived conditions to achieve giant NLMO effects and propose general strategies to realize them in 2D magnets. Our work not only uncovers a series of intriguing NLMO phenomena, but also paves the way for both fundamental research and device applications of ultra-thin NLMO materials.",

Machine learning offers a compelling pathway to accelerate the exploration, but existing models lack either interpretability or fidelity for elucidating the correlation between crystal geometry and property. Here, we report a three-dimensional periodic space sampling method that decomposes large nanoporous structures into local geometrical sites for combined property prediction and site-wise contribution quantification. Trained with a constructed database and retrieved datasets, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency for property prediction on gas storage, separation, and electrical conduction. Meanwhile, this approach enables the interpretation of the prediction and allows for accurate identification of significant local sites for targeted properties. Through identifying transferable high-performance sites across diverse nanoporous frameworks, our model paves the way for interpretable, symmetry-aware nanoporous materials design, which is extensible to other materials, like molecular crystals and beyond.",

    "summary": "Two critical limitations of organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials for solar cells are their poor stability in humid environments and inclusion of toxic lead. In this study, high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) methods are used to computationally model and screen 1845 halide perovskites in search of new materials without these limitations that are promising for solar cell applications. This study focuses on finding materials that are comprised of nontoxic elements, stable in a humid operating environment, and have an optimal bandgap for one of single junction, tandem Si-perovskite, or quantum dot-based solar cells. Single junction materials are also screened on predicted single junction photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies exceeding 22.7%, which is the current highest reported PV efficiency for halide perovskites. Generally, these methods qualitatively reproduce the properties of known promising nontoxic halide perovskites that have either been experimentally evaluated or predicted from theory. From a set of 1845 materials, 15 materials pass all screening criteria for single junction cell applications, 13 of which have not been previously investigated, such as (CH3NH3)0.75Cs0.25SnI3, ((NH2)2CH)Ag0.5Sb0.5Br3, CsMn0.875Fe0.125I3, ((CH3)2NH2)Ag0.5Bi0.5I3, and ((NH2)2CH)0.5Rb0.5SnI3. These materials, together with others predicted in this study, may be promising candidate materials for stable, highly efficient, and non-toxic perovskite-based solar cells.",

One of the most challenging problems in alloy theory is the identification of stable phases with a never seen prototype; such predictions do not always follow rational strategies. While performing ab initioa data mining of intermetallic compounds we made an unexpected discovery: even in such a well-studied class of systems as metal borides there are previously unknown layered phases comparable in energy to the existing ones. With ab initio calculations we show that the new metal-sandwich (MS) lithium monoboride phases are marginally stable under ambient conditions but become favored over the known stoichiometric compounds under moderate pressures. The MS lithium monoboride exhibits electronic features similar to those in magnesium diboride and is expected to be a good superconductor.",

    "summary": "We discover many new crystalline solid materials with fast single crystal Li ion conductivity at room temperature, discovered through density functional theory simulations guided by machine learning-based methods. The discovery of new solid Li superionic conductors is of critical importance to the development of safe all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. With a predictive universal structure-property relationship for fast ion conduction not well understood, the search for new solid Li ion conductors has relied largely on trial-and-error computational and experimental searches over the last several decades. In this work, we perform a guided search of materials space with a machine learning (ML)-based prediction model for material selection and density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations for calculating ionic conductivity. These materials are screened from over 12,000 experimentally synthesized and characterized candidates with very diverse structures and compositions. When compared to a random search of materials space, we find that the ML-guided search is 2.7 times more likely to identify fast Li ion conductors, with at least a 45x improvement in the log-average of room temperature Li ion conductivity. The F1 score of the ML-based model is 0.50, 3.5 times better than the F1 score expected from completely random guesswork. In a head-to-head competition against six Ph.D. students working in the field, we find that the ML-based model doubles the F1 score of human experts in its ability to identify fast Li-ion conductors from atomistic structure with a thousand- fold increase in speed, clearly demonstrating the utility of this model for the research community. All conducting materials reported here lack transition metals and are predicted to exhibit low electronic conduction, high stability against oxidation, and high thermodynamic stability.",

Unlike traditional machine learning models, which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction, interpretation and Q\\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization; and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents. Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness.",

    "summary": "Due to the vast chemical space, discovering materials with a specific function is challenging. Chemical formulas are obligated to conform to a set of exacting criteria such as charge neutrality, balanced electronegativity, synthesizability, and mechanical stability. In response to this formidable task, we introduce a deep learning-based generative model for material composition and structure design by learning and exploiting explicit and implicit chemical knowledge. Our pipeline first uses deep diffusion language models as the generator of compositions and then applies a template-based crystal structure prediction algorithm to predict their corresponding structures, which is then followed by structure relaxation using a universal graph neural network-based potential. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the formation energies and energy-above-the-hull analysis are used to validate new structures generated through our pipeline. Based on the DFT calculation results, six new materials, including Ti2HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2, TaReO4, HfTiO2, and HfMnO2, with formation energy less than zero have been found. Remarkably, among these, four materials, namely Ti2$HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2, and TaReO4, exhibit an e-above-hull energy of less than 0.3 eV. These findings have proved the effectiveness of our approach.",

For organic crystals, the need to predict solid-state electronic properties from molecular structure alone is an exceedingly difficult task for typical, regression-based design strategies. In this paper, we present a new strategy for designing organic crystals which circumvents the need to regress solid-state physical properties directly. At the core of this strategy is an electronic structure chart, a two-dimensional projection of an organic crystal database in which each material is positioned according to its solid-state electronic properties. We illustrate this strategy by identifying a new molecule which is predicted to show a targeted band gap and better-than-average band curvatures in the crystalline state. This strategy is the first data-driven method which can design new molecules on the basis of genuine solid-state electronic properties, and has potential to accelerate breakthroughs in the field of organic electronics and beyond.",

    "summary": "Concrete is the most widely used engineered material in the world with more than 10 billion tons produced annually. Unfortunately, with that scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering performance requirements. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled machines to generate highly plausible artifacts, such as images of realistic looking faces. Semi-supervised generative models allow generation of artifacts with specific, desired characteristics. In this work, we use Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), a type of semi-supervised generative model, to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained using open data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository joined with environmental impact data computed using a web-based tool. We demonstrate CVAEs can design concrete formulas with lower emissions and natural resource usage while meeting design requirements. To ensure fair comparison between extant and generated formulas, we also train regression models to predict the environmental impacts and strength of discovered formulas. With these results, a construction engineer may create a formula that meets structural needs and best addresses local environmental concerns.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities, effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints.

This study introduces a computational routine to predict solid-state phase stability and calculates elastic constants to determine high temperature viability. With it, machine learning models were trained on 1,014 Mo-Re-W structures to enable a large compilation of elastic and thermal properties over the complete Mo-Re-W compositional domain with extreme resolution. A series of heat maps spanning the full compositional domain were generated to visually present the impact of alloy constituents on the alloy properties. Our findings identified a balanced (Mo,W) + Re blend as a promising composition for high temperature applications, attributed to a strong and stable (Mo,W) matrix with high Re content and the formation of strengthening (W,Re) precipitates that enhanced mechanical performance at 1600oC. Several Mo-Re-W compositions were manufactured to experimentally validate the computational predictions. This approach provides an efficient and system-agnostic pathway for designing and optimizing alloys for high-temperature applications.",

    "summary": "Proposing new materials by atom substitution based on periodic table similarity is a conventional strategy of searching for materials with desired property. We introduce a machine learning frame work that promotes this paradigm to be property-specific and quantitative. It is of peculiar usefulness in situations where abundance data is accessible for learning general knowledge but samples for the problem of interest are relatively scarce. We showcase its usage and viability in the problem of separating high entropy alloys with different structural phases, for which a very simple data-driven criterion achieves differentiating ability comparable with widely used empirical criteria. Its flexibility and generability make it a promising tool in other material discovery tasks and far beyond.",

    "summary": "Polar topological structures in ferroelectric thin films have recently drawn significant interest due to their fascinating physical behaviors and promising applications in high-density nonvolatile memories. However, most polar topological patterns are only observed in the perovskites superlattices. Here, we report the discovery of the tunable ferroelectric polar topological defective structures designed and achieved by strain engineering in two-dimensional PbX (X=S, Se, and Te) materials using multiscale computational simulations. First, the first-principles calculations demonstrate the strain-induced recoverable ferroelectric phase transition in such 2D materials. The unique polar topological vortex pattern is then induced by applied mechanical indentation, evidenced by molecular dynamics simulations based on a developed deep-learning potential. According to the strain phase diagram and applied complex strain loadings, the diverse polar topological structures, including antivortex structure and flux-closure structure, are predicted to be emergent through the finite-element simulations. We conclude that strain engineering is promising to tailor various designed reversible polar topologies in ultra-flexible 2D materials, which provide excellent opportunities for next-generation nanoelectronics and sensor devices.",

    "summary": "Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect conformational diversity. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.",

    "summary": "Machine learning (ML) is widely used to explore crystal materials and predict their properties. However, the training is time-consuming for deep-learning models, and the regression process is a black box that is hard to interpret. Also, the preprocess to transfer a crystal structure into the input of ML, called descriptor, needs to be designed carefully. To efficiently predict important properties of materials, we propose an approach based on ensemble learning consisting of regression trees to predict formation energy and elastic constants based on small-size datasets of carbon allotropes as an example. Without using any descriptor, the inputs are the properties calculated by molecular dynamics with 9 different classical interatomic potentials. Overall, the results from ensemble learning are more accurate than those from classical interatomic potentials, and ensemble learning can capture the relatively accurate properties from the 9 classical potentials as criteria for predicting the final properties.",

    "summary": "Polymorphism, the ability of a compound to crystallize in multiple distinct structures, plays a vital role in determining the physical, chemical, and functional properties of materials. Accurate identification and prediction of polymorphic structures are critical for materials design, drug development, and device optimization, as unknown or overlooked polymorphs may lead to unexpected performance or stability issues. Despite its significance, predicting polymorphism directly from a chemical composition remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between molecular conformations, crystal packing, and symmetry constraints. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of polymorphic materials from the Materials Project database, uncovering key statistical patterns in their composition, space group distributions, and polyhedral building blocks. We discover that frequent polymorph pairs across space groups, such as (71, 225), display recurring topological motifs that persist across different compounds, highlighting topology not symmetry alone as a key factor in polymorphic recurrence. We reveal that many polymorphs exhibit consistent local polyhedral environments despite differences in their symmetry or packing. Additionally, by constructing polyhedron connectivity graphs and embedding their topology, we successfully cluster polymorphs and structurally similar materials even across different space groups, demonstrating that topological similarity serves as a powerful descriptor for polymorphic behavior. Our findings provide new insights into the structural characteristics of polymorphic materials and demonstrate the potential of data mining and machine learning for accelerating polymorph discovery and design.",

However, to build these connections, materials data must be translated into a numerical form, called a representation, that can be processed by a machine learning model. Datasets in materials science vary in format (ranging from images to spectra), size, and fidelity. Predictive models vary in scope and property of interests. Here, we review context-dependent strategies for constructing representations that enable the use of materials as inputs or outputs of machine learning models. Furthermore, we discuss how modern ML techniques can learn representations from data and transfer chemical and physical information between tasks. Finally, we outline high-impact questions that have not been fully resolved and thus, require further investigation.",

    "summary": "Advances in Generative AI tools have allowed designers to manipulate existing 3D models using text or image-based prompts, enabling creators to explore different design goals. Photochromic color-changing systems, on the other hand, allow for the reprogramming of surface texture of 3D models, enabling easy customization of physical objects and opening up the possibility of using object surfaces for data display. However, existing photochromic systems require the user to manually design the desired texture, inspect the simulation of the pattern on the object, and verify the efficacy of the generated pattern. These manual design, inspection, and verification steps prevent the user from efficiently exploring the design space of possible patterns. Thus, by designing an automated workflow desired for an end-to-end texture application process, we can allow rapid iteration on different practicable patterns.\n  In this workshop paper, we discuss the possibilities of extending generative AI systems, with material and design constraints for reprogrammable surfaces with photochromic materials. By constraining generative AI systems to colors and materials possible to be physically realized with photochromic dyes, we can create tools that would allow users to explore different viable patterns, with text and image-based prompts. We identify two focus areas in this topic: photochromic material constraints and design constraints for data-encoded textures. We highlight the current limitations of using generative AI tools to create viable textures using photochromic material. Finally, we present possible approaches to augment generative AI methods to take into account the photochromic material constraints, allowing for the creation of viable photochromic textures rapidly and easily.",

    "summary": "Identifying the key microstructure representations is crucial for Computational Materials Design (CMD). However, existing microstructure characterization and reconstruction (MCR) techniques have limitations to be applied for materials design. Model-based MCR approaches do not have parameters that can serve as design variables, while MCR techniques that rely on dimension reduction tend to lose important microstructural information. In this work, we present a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitations of existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarial networks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables and microstructures. Thereafter, the low-dimensional latent variables serve as design variables, and a Bayesian optimization framework is applied to obtain microstructures with desired material property. Due to the special design of the network architecture, the proposed methodology is able to identify the latent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize the information loss even for complex material microstructures. The validity of the proposed methodology is tested numerically on a synthetic microstructure dataset and its effectiveness for materials design is evaluated through a case study of optimizing optical performance for energy absorption. In addition, the scalability and transferability of proposed methodology are also demonstrated in this work. Specifically, the proposed methodology is scalable to generate arbitrary sized microstructures, and it can serve as a pre-trained model to improve the performance of a structure-property predictive model via transfer learning.",

Applications to titanium alloys, high-entropy alloys, and shape memory alloys demonstrate up to 23% gains in prediction accuracy.

Substantial advancements have been made in CSP of inorganic and molecular crystals, while hybrid materials, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been unfairly overlooked.

Here, we propose a data-driven method to tackle current needs of computational MOF discovery. By examining CSP through the lens of reticular chemistry, coarse-grained neural networks were implemented to predict underlying net topology of crystal graphs. The models showed satisfactory performance, which was next enhanced by limiting the applicability domain. Flue gas separation was used as an illustrative example to validate the proposed CSP approach. Several hundred in silico-generated systems revealed a notable discrepancy in adsorption capacity among competing polymorphs.",

    "summary": "With the discovery of topological semimetals, it has been found that the band touching points near the Fermi level are of great importance. They give rise to many exciting phenomena in these materials. Moreover, these points, commonly known as nodes, are related to several properties of these semimetals. Thus, the proper estimation of their coordinates is extremely needed for better understanding of the properties of these materials. We have designed a Python 3 based code named PY-Nodes for efficiently finding the nodes present in a given material using first-principle approach. The present version of the code is interfaced with the WIEN2k package. For benchmarking the code, it has been tested on some famous materials which possess characteristic nodes. These include - TaAs, a well-known Weyl semimetal, Na$_3$Bi, which is categorized as Dirac semimetal, CaAgAs, classified as a nodal-line semimetal and YAuPb, which is claimed to be non-trivial topological semimetal. In case of TaAs, 24 nodes are obtained from our calculations. On computing their chiralities, it is found that 12 pairs of nodes having equal and opposite chirality are obtained. Furthermore, for Na$_3$Bi, a pair of nodes are obtained on the either side of $Γ$-point in the $\\boldsymbol{k_3}$ direction. In case of CaAgAs, several nodes are obtained in the $k_z$=0 plane. These nodes, when plotted in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane, form a closed loop which is generally referred to as nodal-line. Finally, in the case of YAuPb, large number of nodes are obtained in the vicinity of $Γ$-point. The results obtained for these materials are in good match with the previous works carried out by different research groups. This assures the reliability and the efficiency of the PY-Nodes code for estimating the nodes present in a given material.",

    "summary": "In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. Yet, generic principles linking lattice architecture, strain, and band topology remain scarce. Here, using a unified graph-theoretic framework we generate entire families of two-dimensional lattices and, using analytical tight-binding calculations, demonstrate that a single mechanical knob -- uniform in-plane strain -- drives universal transitions between trivial insulating, Dirac semimetal, and quantum spin-Hall phases across all lattices. The framework yields several flat band lattices that were hitherto absent or largely unexplored in the literature -- for example, the checkerboard split-graph and triangular-Kagome lattices -- whose strain-driven topological phase diagrams we establish here for the first time. The design rules implied by our studies provide a blueprint for engineering topological states in a wide variety of 2D materials, photonic crystals, and circuit lattices, and are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of strain-programmable quantum matter.",

The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.",

Approaches such as inverse reinforcement learning attempt to overcome this challenge, but require expert demonstrations, which can be difficult or expensive to obtain in practice. We propose variational inverse control with events (VICE), which generalizes inverse reinforcement learning methods to cases where full demonstrations are not needed, such as when only samples of desired goal states are available. Our method is grounded in an alternative perspective on control and reinforcement learning, where an agent's goal is to maximize the probability that one or more events will happen at some point in the future, rather than maximizing cumulative rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on continuous control tasks, with a focus on high-dimensional observations like images where rewards are hard or even impossible to specify.",

    "summary": "The recent observation of a ferroelectric-like structural transition in metallic LiOsO$_3$ has generated a flurry of interest in the properties of polar metals. Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons screen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure with a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether long-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in driving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with first-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the mechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO$_3$ and both insulating and electron-doped ATiO$_3$ perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic forces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO$_3$ (which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO$_3$ and LiOsO$_3$ emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and this mechanism is `resistant' to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our results suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between metallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our calculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising avenues for further research.",

    "summary": "Intercalation materials are promising candidates for reversible energy storage and are, for example, used as lithium-battery electrodes, hydrogen-storage compounds, and electrochromic materials. An important issue preventing the more widespread use of these materials is that they undergo structural transformations (of up to ~10% lattice strains) during intercalation, which expand the material, nucleate microcracks, and, ultimately, lead to material failure. Besides the structural transformation of lattices, the crystallographic texture of the intercalation material plays a key role in governing ion-transport properties, generating phase separation microstructures, and elastically interacting with crystal defects. In this review, I provide an overview of how the structural transformation of lattices, phase transformation microstructures, and crystallographic defects affect the chemo-mechanical properties of intercalation materials. In each section, I identify the key challenges and opportunities to crystallographically design intercalation compounds to improve their properties and lifespans. I predominantly cite examples from the literature of intercalation cathodes used in rechargeable batteries, however, the identified challenges and opportunities are transferable to a broader range of intercalation compounds.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in theoretical structure prediction methods and high-throughput computational techniques are revolutionizing experimental discovery of the thermodynamically stable inorganic materials. Metastable materials represent a new frontier for studies, since even simple binary non ground state compounds of common elements may be awaiting discovery. However, there are significant research challenges related to non-equilibrium thin film synthesis and crystal structure predictions, such as small strained crystals in the experimental samples and energy minimization based theoretical algorithms. Here we report on experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as theoretical first-principles calculations of a previously unreported mixed-valent binary tin nitride. Thin film experiments indicate that this novel material is N-deficient SnN with tin in the mixed II/IV valence state and a small low-symmetry unit cell. Theoretical calculations suggest that the most likely crystal structure has the space group 2 (SG2) related to the distorted delafossite (SG166), which is nearly 0.1 eV/atom above the ground state SnN polymorph. This observation is rationalized by the structural similarity of the SnN distorted delafossite to the chemically related Sn3N4 spinel compound, which provides a fresh scientific insight into the reasons for growth of polymorphs of the metastable material. In addition to reporting on the discovery of the simple binary SnN compound, this paper illustrates a possible way of combining a wide range of advanced characterization techniques with the first-principle property calculation methods, to elucidate the most likely crystal structure of the previously unreported metastable materials.",

Using a trained classifier, we screen a crystal structure database to identify promising candidates for higher fidelity simulations. We focus on Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$, CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and use density functional theory (DFT) to determine their electronic and magnetic ground states and assess their microscopic MIT mechanisms. We further apply machine learning regression models to estimate their transition temperatures and employ synthesis prediction tools to identify likely precursors and reaction routes. This integrated approach reduces the time and effort required to identify, understand, and synthesize new MIT materials, providing a generalizable pathway for accelerating correlated quantum materials discovery.",

    "summary": "The interplay between magnetism and topological electronic structure offers a large freedom to design strong anomalous Hall effect (AHE) materials. A nodal line from band inversion is a typical band structure to generate strong AHE. Whereas, in most collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs), the integration of Berry curvatures on Brillouin zone is forced to zero by the joint $TO$ symmetry, where $T$ and $O$ are time reversal and a space group operation, respectively. Even with inverted band structures, such kind of AFM cannot have AHE. Therefore, so far, AFM nodal line band structures constructed by spin degenerated bands didn't get much attentions in AHE materials. In this work, we illustrate that such kind of band structure indeed provides a promising starting point to generated strong local Berry curvature by perturbations and, therefore, strong intrinsic AHE. In specific AFM compounds of $A$MnBi$_2$($A$=Ca and Yb) with inverted band structure, we found a strong AHE induced by a weak spin canting, and due to nodal line in the band structure the anomalous Hall conductivity keeps growing as the canting angle increases. Since such spin-canting can be adjusted via doping experimentally, it provides another effective strategy to generate and manipulate strong AHE",

While heuristic knowledge based descriptors have been combined with ML algorithms to achieve good performance, the complexity of the physicochemical mechanisms makes it urgently needed to exploit representation learning from either compositions or structures for building highly effective materials machine learning models. Among these methods, the graph neural networks have shown the best performance by its capability to learn high-level features from crystal structures. However, all these models suffer from their inability to scale up the models due to the over-smoothing issue of their message-passing GNN architecture. Here we propose a novel graph attention neural network model DeeperGATGNN with differentiable group normalization and skip-connections, which allows to train very deep graph neural network models (e.g. 30 layers compared to 3-9 layers in previous works). Through systematic benchmark studies over six benchmark datasets for energy and band gap predictions, we show that our scalable DeeperGATGNN model needs little costly hyper-parameter tuning for different datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performances over five properties out of six with up to 10\\% improvement. Our work shows that to deal with the high complexity of mapping the crystal materials structures to their properties, large-scale very deep graph neural networks are needed to achieve robust performances.",

Open-tunnel oxides, featuring one-dimensional channels or nanopores, show promise for enabling effective ion transport. However, the vast range of compositional possibilities renders traditional experimental and quantum-based methods impractical for large-scale studies. This work presents a generative AI framework that uses the Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) and a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to expedite the discovery of stable open-tunneled oxide materials for multivalent-ion batteries.\n  By combining machine learning with data mining techniques, five promising transition metal oxide (TMO) structures are generated. These structures, known for forming open-tunnel oxide frameworks, are structurally validated through Density Functional Theory (DFT). The results show that the generated structures have lower formation energies compared to similar compositions in the Materials Project (MP) database, indicating improved thermodynamic stability.\n  Additionally, the graph-based M3GNet model is employed to relax further generated structures, providing a more computationally efficient alternative to DFT. Machine learning-based predictions of formation energy, band gap, and energy above the hull refine the selection process, leading to the identification of materials with significant potential for real-world battery applications. This research demonstrates the power of generative AI in rapidly exploring the vast chemical space of TMOs, offering a new approach to discovering stable open-tunnel oxides for multivalent-ion batteries. The results highlight the potential of this approach to contribute to more sustainable energy storage technologies, addressing the growing concerns surrounding the scarcity of lithium.",

We mine the Cambridge Structural Database for non-centrosymmetric materials and use this structural data in tandem with density functional theory calculations to predict new materials that efficiently generate terahertz radiation. This enables us to (in a relatively short time) discover, synthesize, and grow large, high-quality crystals of four promising materials and characterize them for intense terahertz generation. In a direct comparison to the current state-of-the-art organic terahertz generation crystals, these new materials excel. The discovery and characterization of these novel terahertz generators validates the approach of combining data mining with density functional theory calculations to predict properties of high-performance organic materials, potentially for a host of exciting applications.",

    "summary": "Structural prediction for the discovery of novel materials is a long sought after goal of computational physics and materials sciences. The success is rather limited for methods such as the simulated annealing method (SA) that require expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations and follow unintelligent search paths. Here a machine-learning based crystal combinatorial optimization program (CCOP) with a fitting-search style is proposed to drastically improve the efficiency of structural search in SA. CCOP uses a graph neural network energy prediction model to reduce the DFT cost and a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to direct the search path. Tests on six multi-alloys show the energy prediction model is capable of extracting the bonding characteristics of the complex alloys to achieve interpretability. It also achieves high accuracy with a tiny training set (an increment of 30 samples per iteration) by active learning in less than 5 iterations. Comparison with a few conventional methods shows that CCOP finds the lowest-energy structures with the smallest number of search steps. CCOP cuts the computing cost of SA by two orders of magnitude, while providing better search results than SA. CCOP is promising for serving as a broadly applicable tool for the efficient crystal structure predictions.",

    "summary": "Billions of organic molecules are known, but only a tiny fraction of the functional inorganic materials have been discovered, a particularly relevant problem to the community searching for new quantum materials. Recent advancements in machine-learning-based generative models, particularly diffusion models, show great promise for generating new, stable materials. However, integrating geometric patterns into materials generation remains a challenge. Here, we introduce Structural Constraint Integration in the GENerative model (SCIGEN). Our approach can modify any trained generative diffusion model by strategic masking of the denoised structure with a diffused constrained structure prior to each diffusion step to steer the generation toward constrained outputs. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that SCIGEN effectively performs conditional sampling from the original distribution, which is crucial for generating stable constrained materials. We generate eight million compounds using Archimedean lattices as prototype constraints, with over 10% surviving a multi-staged stability pre-screening. High-throughput density functional theory (DFT) on 26,000 survived compounds shows that over 50% passed structural optimization at the DFT level. Since the properties of quantum materials are closely related to geometric patterns, our results indicate that SCIGEN provides a general framework for generating quantum materials candidates.",

The inverse design of these devices is a non-convex optimization problem in a high dimensional space, making global optimization a major challenge. We present a new type of population-based global optimization algorithm for metasurfaces that is enabled by the training of a generative neural network. The loss function used for backpropagation depends on the generated pattern layouts, their efficiencies, and efficiency gradients, which are calculated by the adjoint variables method using forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations. We observe that the distribution of devices generated by the network continuously shifts towards high performance design space regions over the course of optimization. Upon training completion, the best generated devices have efficiencies comparable to or exceeding the best devices designed using standard topology optimization. Our proposed global optimization algorithm can generally apply to other gradient-based optimization problems in optics, mechanics and electronics.",

The predictions and inner workings of models should provide a certain degree of explainability by human experts, permitting the identification of potential model issues or limitations, building trust on model predictions and unveiling unexpected correlations that may lead to scientific insights. In this work, we summarize applications of interpretability and explainability techniques for materials science and chemistry and discuss how these techniques can improve the outcome of scientific studies. We discuss various challenges for interpretable machine learning in materials science and, more broadly, in scientific settings. In particular, we emphasize the risks of inferring causation or reaching generalization by purely interpreting machine learning models and the need of uncertainty estimates for model explanations. Finally, we showcase a number of exciting developments in other fields that could benefit interpretability in material science and chemistry problems.",

For achieving optimal extrinsic properties their microstructure needs to be controlled in a multi-parameter space, which usually requires a too-high number of experiments to map. We propose to master thin film processing microstructure complexity and to reduce the cost of microstructure design by joining combinatorial experimentation with generative deep learning models to extract synthesis-composition-microstructure relations. A generative machine learning approach comprising a variational autoencoder and a conditional generative adversarial network predicts structure zone diagrams. We demonstrate that generative models provide a so far unseen level of quality of generated structure zone diagrams comprising chemical and processing complexity for the optimization of chemical composition and processing parameters to achieve a desired microstructure.",

Currently both graph and 3D voxel representation methods are based on the heterogeneous elements of the crystal structures. Here, we propose to use electronic charge density (ECD) as a generic unified 3D descriptor for materials property prediction with the advantage of possessing close relation with the physical and chemical properties of materials. We developed an ECD based 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting elastic properties of materials, in which CNNs can learn effective hierarchical features with multiple convolving and pooling operations. Extensive benchmark experiments over 2,170 Fm-3m face-centered-cubic (FCC) materials show that our ECD based CNNs can achieve good performance for elasticity prediction. Especially, our CNN models based on the fusion of elemental Magpie features and ECD descriptors achieved the best 5-fold cross-validation performance. More importantly, we showed that our ECD based CNN models can achieve significantly better extrapolation performance when evaluated over non-redundant datasets where there are few neighbor training samples around test samples. As additional validation, we evaluated the predictive performance of our models on 329 materials of space group Fm-3m by comparing to DFT calculated values, which shows better prediction power of our model for bulk modulus than shear modulus. Due to the unified representation power of ECD, it is expected that our ECD based CNN approach can also be applied to predict other physical and chemical properties of crystalline materials.",

    "summary": "Although Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been employed for accelerating materials design in computational materials engineering, existing works are restricted to problems with quantitative variables. However, real designs of materials systems involve both qualitative and quantitative design variables representing material compositions, microstructure morphology, and processing conditions. For mixed-variable problems, existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) approaches represent qualitative factors by dummy variables first and then fit a standard Gaussian process (GP) model with numerical variables as the surrogate model. This approach is restrictive theoretically and fails to capture complex correlations between qualitative levels. We present in this paper the integration of a novel latent-variable (LV) approach for mixed-variable GP modeling with the BO framework for materials design. LVGP is a fundamentally different approach that maps qualitative design variables to underlying numerical LV in GP, which has strong physical justification. It provides flexible parameterization and representation of qualitative factors and shows superior modeling accuracy compared to the existing methods. We demonstrate our approach through testing with numerical examples and materials design examples. It is found that in all test examples the mapped LVs provide intuitive visualization and substantial insight into the nature and effects of the qualitative factors. Though materials designs are used as examples, the method presented is generic and can be utilized for other mixed variable design optimization problems that involve expensive physics-based simulations.",

    "summary": "Until recently, spin-polarization in nonmagnetic materials was the exclusive territory of non- centrosymmetric structures. It was recently shown that a form of hidden spin polarization (named the Rashba-2 or R-2 effect) could exist in globally centrosymmetric crystals provided the individual layers belong to polar point group symmetries. This realization could considerably broaden the range of materials that might be considered for spin-polarization spintronic applications to include the hitherto forbidden spintronic compound that belong to centrosymetric symmetries. Here we take the necessary steps to transition from such general, material-agnostic condensed matter theory arguments to material-specific design principles that could aid future laboratory search of R-2 materials. Specifically, we (i) classify different prototype layered structures that have been broadly studied in the literature in terms of their expected R-2 behavior, including the Bi2Se3-structure type (a prototype topological insulator), MoS2-structure type (a prototype valleytronic compound) and LaBiOS2-structure type (a host of superconductivity upon doping); (ii) formulate the properties that ideal R-2 compounds should have in terms of combination of their global unit cell symmetries with specific point group symmetries of their constituent sectors; (iii) use first-principles band theory to search for compounds from the prototype family of LaOBiS2-type structures that satisfy these R-2 design metrics. We initially consider both stable and hypothetical compounds to establish an understanding of trends of R-2 with composition, and then indicate the predictions that are expected to be stable and synthesizable. We predict large spin splittings (up to ~ 200 meV for holes in LaOBiTe2) as well as surface Rashba states. Experimental testing of such predictions is called for.",

Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed, diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space.",

These lattice transformations generate misfit strains and volume changes that, in turn, contribute to the structural decay of intercalation materials and limit their reversible cycling. In this paper, we draw on insights from shape-memory alloys, another class of phase transformation materials, that also undergo large lattice transformations but do so with negligible macroscopic volume changes and internal stresses. We develop a theoretical framework to predict structural transformations in intercalation compounds and establish crystallographic design rules necessary for forming shape-memory-like microstructures in intercalation materials. We use our framework to systematically screen open-source structural databases comprising n > 5000 pairs of intercalation compounds. We identify candidate compounds, such as Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ (Spinel), Li$_x$Ti$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ (NASICON), that approximately satisfy the crystallographic design rules and can be precisely doped to form shape-memory-like microstructures. Throughout, we compare our analytical results with experimental measurements of intercalation compounds. We find a direct correlation between structural transformations, microstructures, and increased capacity retention in these materials. These results, more generally, show that crystallographic designing of intercalation materials could be a novel route to discovering compounds that do not decay with continuous usage.",

    "summary": "Metamaterials are emerging as a new paradigmatic material system to render unprecedented and tailorable properties for a wide variety of engineering applications. However, the inverse design of metamaterial and its multiscale system is challenging due to high-dimensional topological design space, multiple local optima, and high computational cost. To address these hurdles, we propose a novel data-driven metamaterial design framework based on deep generative modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) and a regressor for property prediction are simultaneously trained on a large metamaterial database to map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous, and organized latent space. We show in this study that the latent space of VAE provides a distance metric to measure shape similarity, enable interpolation between microstructures and encode meaningful patterns of variation in geometries and properties. Based on these insights, systematic data-driven methods are proposed for the design of microstructure, graded family, and multiscale system. For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical properties and complex manipulations of microstructures are easily achieved by simple vector operations in the latent space. The vector operation is further extended to generate metamaterial families with a controlled gradation of mechanical properties by searching on a constructed graph model. For multiscale metamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures can be rapidly generated using VAE for target properties at different locations and then assembled by an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure compatibility between adjacent microstructures. We demonstrate our framework by designing both functionally graded and heterogeneous metamaterial systems that achieve desired distortion behaviors.",

    "summary": "Development of new functional ceramics is important for several applications, including electrochemical batteries and fuel cells. Computational prescreening and selection of such materials can help discover novel materials but is challenging due to the high cost of electronic structure calculations which would be needed to compute the structures and properties of interest such as the material's stability and ion diffusion properties. The soft bond valence (SoftBV) approach is attractive for rapid prescreening among multiple compositions and structures, but the simplicity of the approximation can make the results inaccurate. We explore the possibility of enhancing the accuracy of the SoftBV approach when estimating crystal structures by adapting the parameters of the approximation to the chemical composition. Specifically, on the examples of perovskite- and spinel-type oxides that have been proposed as promising solid-state ionic conductors, the screening factor, an independent parameter of the SoftBV approximation, is modeled using linear and non-linear methods as a function of descriptors of chemical composition. We find that making the screening factor a function of composition can noticeably improve the ability of SoftBV to correctly model structures, in particular new, putative crystal structures whose structural parameters are yet unknown. We also analyze the relative importance of nonlinearity and coupling in improving the model and find that while the quality of the model is improved by including nonlinearity, coupling is relatively unimportant. While using a neural network showed no improvement over linear regression, the recently proposed GPR-NN method that is a hybrid between a single hidden layer neural network and kernel regression showed substantial improvement, enabling the prediction of structural parameters of new ceramics with accuracy on the order of 1%.",

    "summary": "Most prediction models for crystal properties employ a unimodal perspective, with graph-based representations, overlooking important non-local information that affects crystal properties. Some recent studies explore the impact of integrating graph and textual information on crystal property predictions to provide the model with this \"missing\" information by concatenation of embeddings. However, such studies do not evaluate which type of textual information is actually beneficial. We concatenate graph representations with text representations derived from textual descriptions with varying levels of detail. These descriptions, generated using the Robocrystallographer package, encompass global (e.g., space group, crystal type), local (e.g., bond lengths, coordination environment), and semiglobal (e.g., connectivity, arrangements) information about the structures. Our approach investigates how augmenting graph-based information with various levels of textual detail influences the performance for predictions for shear modulus and bulk modulus. We demonstrate that while graph representations can capture local structural information, incorporating semiglobal textual information enhances model performance the most. Global information can support performance further in the presence of semiglobal information. Our findings suggest that the strategic inclusion of textual information can enhance property prediction, thereby advancing the design and discovery of advanced novel materials for battery electrodes, catalysts, etc.",

    "summary": "Data scarcity remains a central challenge in materials discovery, where finding meaningful descriptors and tuning models for generalization is critical but inherently a discrete optimization problem prone to multiple local minima confounding the true optimal state. Classical methods often get trapped in these minima, while quantum annealing can escape them via quantum fluctuations, including tunneling, that overcome narrow energy barriers. We present a quantum-assisted machine-learning (QaML) framework that employs quantum annealing to address these combinatorial optimization challenges through feature selection, support-vector training formulated in QUBO form for classification and regression, and a new QUBO-based neural-network pruning formulation. Recursive batching enables quantum annealing to handle large feature spaces beyond current qubit limits, while quantum-pruned networks exhibit superior generalization over classical methods, suggesting that quantum annealing preferentially samples flatter, more stable regions of the loss landscape. Applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a data-limited but compositionally complex testbed, the framework integrates models for fracture-strain classification and yield-strength regression under physics-based constraints. The framework identified and experimentally validated Al8Cr38Fe50Mn2Ti2 (at.%), a single-phase BCC alloy exhibiting a 0.2 % yield strength of 568 MPa, greater than 40 % compressive strain without fracture, and a critical current density in reducing acid nearly an order of magnitude lower than 304 stainless steel. These results establish QA as a practical route to overcome classical optimization limits and accelerate materials discovery.",

To address this challenge, we use microfluidics to quantify the self-assembly dynamics of DNA-programmed colloidal crystals, from thermally-activated nucleation through reaction-limited and diffusion-limited phases of crystal growth. Our detailed measurements of the temperature and concentration dependence of the kinetics at all stages along the crystallization pathway provide a stringent test of classical theories of nucleation and growth. After accounting for the finite rolling rate of micrometer-sized DNA-coated colloids, we find that modified versions of these classical theories quantitatively predict the absolute nucleation and growth rates. We conclude by applying our model to design and demonstrate protocols for assembling large single crystals, including crystals with pronounced structural coloration, an essential step in the creation of next-generation functional materials from colloids.",

    "summary": "The ionic bonding across the lattice and ordered microscopic structures endow crystals with unique symmetry and determine their macroscopic properties. Unconventional crystals, in particular, exhibit non-traditional lattice structures or possess exotic physical properties, making them intriguing subjects for investigation. Therefore, to accurately predict the physical and chemical properties of crystals, it is crucial to consider long-range orders. While GNN excels at capturing the local environment of atoms in crystals, they often face challenges in effectively capturing longer-ranged interactions due to their limited depth. In this paper, we propose CrysToGraph ($\\textbf{Crys}$tals with $\\textbf{T}$ransformers $\\textbf{o}$n $\\textbf{Graph}$s), a novel transformer-based geometric graph network designed specifically for unconventional crystalline systems, and UnconvBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate models' predictive performance on unconventional crystal materials such as defected crystals, low-dimension crystals and MOF. CrysToGraph effectively captures short-range interactions with transformer-based graph convolution blocks as well as long-range interactions with graph-wise transformer blocks. CrysToGraph proofs its effectiveness in modelling unconventional crystal materials in multiple tasks, and moreover, it outperforms most existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of both unconventional crystals and traditional crystals.",

The technique is easy to implement, is faster and yields results much improved over conventional simulation methods for the materials explored.

    "summary": "Quantitative descriptions of the structure-thermal property correlation have been a bottleneck in designing materials with superb thermal properties. In the past decade, the first-principles phonon calculations using density functional theory and the Boltzmann transport equation have become a common practice for predicting the thermal conductivity of new materials. However, first-principles calculations are too costly for high-throughput material screening and multi-scale structural design. First-principles calculations also face several fundamental challenges in modeling thermal transport properties, e.g., of crystalline materials with defects, of amorphous materials, and for materials at high temperatures. In the past five years, machine learning started to play a role in solving these challenges. This review provides a comprehensive summary and discussion on the state-of-the-art, future opportunities, and the remaining challenges in implementing machine learning for studying thermal conductivity. After an introduction to the working principles of machine learning and descriptors of material structures, recent research using machine learning to study thermal transport is discussed. Three major applications of machine learning for predicting thermal properties are discussed. First, machine learning is applied to solve the challenges in modeling phonon transport of crystals with defects, in amorphous materials, and at high temperatures. Machine learning is used to build high-fidelity interatomic potentials to bridge the gap between first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Second, machine learning can be used to study the correlation between thermal conductivity and other properties for high-throughput materials screening. Finally, machine learning is a powerful tool for structural design to achieve target thermal conductance or thermal conductivity.",

    "summary": "Accurate prediction of physical properties is critical for discovering and designing novel materials. Machine learning technologies have attracted significant attention in the materials science community for their potential for large-scale screening. Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCNN) is one of the most successful machine learning methods because of its flexibility and effectiveness in describing 3D structural data. Most existing GCNN models focus on the topological structure but overly simplify the three-dimensional geometric structure. However, in materials science, the 3D-spatial distribution of atoms is crucial for determining the atomic states and interatomic forces. This paper proposes an adaptive GCNN with a novel convolution mechanism that simultaneously models atomic interactions among all neighbor atoms in three-dimensional space. We apply the proposed model to two distinctly challenging problems on predicting material properties. The first is Henry's constant for gas adsorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), which is notoriously difficult because of its high sensitivity to atomic configurations. The second is the ion conductivity in solid-state crystal materials, which is difficult because of few labeled data available for training. The new model outperforms existing graph-based models on both data sets, suggesting that the critical three-dimensional geometric information is indeed captured.",

    "summary": "Material scientists are increasingly adopting the use of machine learning (ML) for making potentially important decisions, such as, discovery, development, optimization, synthesis and characterization of materials. However, despite ML's impressive performance in commercial applications, several unique challenges exist when applying ML in materials science applications. In such a context, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we identify common pitfalls of existing ML techniques when learning from underrepresented/imbalanced material data. Specifically, we show that with imbalanced data, standard methods for assessing quality of ML models break down and lead to misleading conclusions. Furthermore, we found that the model's own confidence score cannot be trusted and model introspection methods (using simpler models) do not help as they result in loss of predictive performance (reliability-explainability trade-off). Second, to overcome these challenges, we propose a general-purpose explainable and reliable machine-learning framework. Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline that employs an ensemble of simpler models to reliably predict material properties. We also propose a transfer learning technique and show that the performance loss due to models' simplicity can be overcome by exploiting correlations among different material properties. A new evaluation metric and a trust score to better quantify the confidence in the predictions are also proposed. To improve the interpretability, we add a rationale generator component to our framework which provides both model-level and decision-level explanations.

    "summary": "Machine learning models are increasingly used in many engineering fields thanks to the widespread digital data, growing computing power, and advanced algorithms. Artificial neural networks (ANN) is the most popular machine learning model in recent years. Although many ANN models have been used in the design and analysis of composite materials and structures, there are still some unsolved issues that hinder the acceptance of ANN models in the practical design and analysis of composite materials and structures. Moreover, the emerging machine learning techniques are posting new opportunities and challenges in the data-based design paradigm. This paper aims to give a state-of-the-art literature review of ANN models in the nonlinear constitutive modeling, multiscale surrogate modeling, and design optimization of composite materials and structures. This review has been designed to focus on the discussion of the general frameworks and benefits of ANN models to the above problems. Moreover, challenges and opportunities in each key problem are identified and discussed. This paper is expected to open the discussion of future research scope and new directions to enable efficient, robust, and accurate data-driven design and analysis of composite materials and structures.",

Current materials include those based on a topological to trivial phase transition, such as in TlBiSe$_{2-x}$S$_x$ and Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te, Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$, Bi$_{2-x}$In$_x$Se$_3$, and Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se. Some more recently revealed materials, Na$_3$Bi and Cd$_3$As$_2$, are 3D Dirac semimetals in their native composition. The different design principles presented each yield novel predictions for new candidates. For Case I, 3D Dirac semimetals based on charge balanced compounds, BaAgBi, SrAgBi, YbAuSb, PtBi$_2$ and SrSn$_2$As$_2$ are identified as candidates. For Case II, 3D Dirac semi-metals in analogy to graphene, BaGa$_2$ is identified as a candidate, and BaPt and Li$_2$Pt are discussed. For Case III, 3D Dirac semi-metals based on glide planes and screw axes, TlMo$_3$Te$_3$ and the AMo$_3$X$_3$ family in general (A=K, Na, In, Tl, X=Se,Te) as well as the Group IVb trihalides such as HfI$_3$ are identified as candidates.

Recently, the problem of generating crystal materials has received increasing attention, however, it remains unclear to what extent, or in what way, we can develop generative models that consider both the periodicity and equivalence geometric of crystal structures. To alleviate this issue, we propose two unified models that act at the same time on crystal lattice and atomic positions using periodic equivariant architectures.

Here we use first-principles high-throughput structure screening to predict a new polar metal in bulk and thin film forms. After screening more than 1000 different crystal structures, we find that ordered BiPbTi2O6 can crystallize in three polar and metallic structures, which can be transformed between via pressure or strain. In a heterostructure of layered BiPbTi2O6 and PbTiO3, multiple states with different relative orientations of BiPbTi2O6 polar displacements, and PbTiO3 polarization, can be stabilized. At room temperature, the interfacial coupling enables electric fields to first switch PbTiO3 polarization and subsequently drive 180° change of BiPbTi2O6 polar displacements. At low temperatures, the heterostructure provides a tunable tunnelling barrier and might be used in multi-state memory devices.",

    "summary": "Crystal property prediction is a crucial aspect of developing novel materials. However, there are two technical challenges to be addressed for speeding up the investigation of crystals. First, labeling crystal properties is intrinsically difficult due to the high cost and time involved in physical simulations or lab experiments. Second, crystals adhere to a specific quantum chemical principle known as periodic invariance, which is often not captured by existing machine learning methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose the crystal-specific pre-training framework for learning crystal representations with self-supervision. The framework designs a mutex mask strategy for enhancing representation learning so as to alleviate the limited labels available for crystal property prediction. Moreover, we take into account the specific periodic invariance in crystal structures by developing a periodic invariance multi-graph module and periodic attribute learning within our framework. This framework has been tested on eight different tasks. The experimental results on these tasks show that the framework achieves promising prediction performance and is able to outperform recent strong baselines.",

    "summary": "One of the enticing features common to most of the two-dimensional electronic systems that are currently at the forefront of materials science research is the ability to easily introduce a combination of planar deformations and bending in the system. Since the electronic properties are ultimately determined by the details of atomic orbital overlap, such mechanical manipulations translate into modified electronic properties. Here, we present a general-purpose optimization framework for tailoring physical properties of two-dimensional electronic systems by manipulating the state of local strain, allowing a one-step route from their design to experimental implementation. A definite example, chosen for its relevance in light of current experiments in graphene nanostructures, is the optimization of the experimental parameters that generate a prescribed spatial profile of pseudomagnetic fields in graphene. But the method is general enough to accommodate a multitude of possible experimental parameters and conditions whereby deformations can be imparted to the graphene lattice, and complies, by design, with graphene's elastic equilibrium and elastic compatibility constraints. As a result, it efficiently answers the inverse problem of determining the optimal values of a set of external or control parameters that result in a graphene deformation whose associated pseudomagnetic field profile best matches a prescribed target. The ability to address this inverse problem in an expedited way is one key step for practical implementations of the concept of two-dimensional systems with electronic properties strain-engineered to order. The general-purpose nature of this calculation strategy means that it can be easily applied to the optimization of other relevant physical quantities which directly depend on the local strain field, not just in graphene but in other two-dimensional electronic membranes.",

    "summary": "Semiconductor materials provide a compelling platform for quantum technologies (QT), and the properties of a vast amount of materials can be found in databases containing information from both experimental and theoretical explorations. However, searching these databases to find promising candidate materials for quantum technology applications is a major challenge. Therefore, we have developed a framework for the automated discovery of semiconductor host platforms for QT using material informatics and machine learning methods, resulting in a dataset consisting of over $25.000$ materials and nearly $5000$ physics-informed features. Three approaches were devised, named the Ferrenti, extended Ferrenti and the empirical approach, to label data for the supervised machine learning (ML) methods logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting. We find that of the three, the empirical approach relying exclusively on findings from the literature predicted substantially fewer candidates than the other two approaches with a clear distinction between suitable and unsuitable candidates when comparing the two largest eigenvalues in the covariance matrix. In contrast to expectations from the literature and that found for the Ferrenti and extended Ferrenti approaches focusing on band gap and ionic character, the ML methods from the empirical approach highlighted features related to symmetry and crystal structure, including bond length, orientation and radial distribution, as influential when predicting a material as suitable for QT. All three approaches and all four ML methods agreed on a subset of $47$ eligible candidates %(to a probability of $>50 \\ \\%$) of $8$ elemental, $29$ binary, and $10$ tertiary compounds, and provide a basis for further material explorations towards quantum technology.",

    "summary": "Optimization strategies driven by machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or materials. Although many of these constraints are known a priori, they can be interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate their practical utility in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the synthesis of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions, and the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic accessibility constraints. The tools developed constitute a simple, yet versatile strategy to enable model-based optimization with known experimental constraints, contributing to its applicability as a core component of autonomous platforms for scientific discovery.",

A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method and self-improvement learning. We evaluate GraphXForm on various drug design tasks, demonstrating superior objective scores compared to state-of-the-art molecular design approaches. Furthermore, we apply GraphXForm to two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, again outperforming alternative methods while flexibly enforcing structural constraints or initiating design from existing molecular structures.",

    "summary": "Deep generative models have emerged as an exciting avenue for inverse molecular design, with progress coming from the interplay between training algorithms and molecular representations. One of the key challenges in their applicability to materials science and chemistry has been the lack of access to sizeable training datasets with property labels. Published patents contain the first disclosure of new materials prior to their publication in journals, and are a vast source of scientific knowledge that has remained relatively untapped in the field of data-driven molecular design. Because patents are filed seeking to protect specific uses, molecules in patents can be considered to be weakly labeled into application classes. Furthermore, patents published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are downloadable and have machine-readable text and molecular structures. In this work, we train domain-specific generative models using patent data sources by developing an automated pipeline to go from USPTO patent digital files to the generation of novel candidates with minimal human intervention. We test the approach on two in-class extracted datasets, one in organic electronics and another in tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We then evaluate the ability of generative models trained on these in-class datasets on two categories of tasks (distribution learning and property optimization), identify strengths and limitations, and suggest possible explanations and remedies that could be used to overcome these in practice.",

    "summary": "The frequency-dependent optical spectrum is pivotal for a broad range of applications, from material characterization to optoelectronics and energy harvesting. Data-driven surrogate models, trained on density functional theory (DFT) data, have effectively alleviated the scalability limitations of DFT while preserving its chemical accuracy, expediting material discovery. However, prevailing machine learning (ML) efforts often focus on scalar properties such as the band gap, overlooking the complexities of optical spectra. In this work, we employ deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the frequency-dependent complex-valued dielectric function across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra directly from crystal structures. We explore multiple architectures for multi-output spectral representation of the dielectric function and utilize various multi-fidelity learning strategies, such as transfer learning and fidelity embedding, to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of high-fidelity DFT data. Additionally, we model key solar cell absorption efficiency metrics, demonstrating that learning these parameters is enhanced when integrated through a learning bias within the learning of the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient. This study demonstrates that leveraging multi-output and multi-fidelity ML techniques enables accurate predictions of optical spectra from crystal structures, providing a versatile tool for rapidly screening materials for optoelectronics, optical sensing, and solar energy applications across an extensive frequency spectrum.",

    "summary": "Topology optimization (TO) is a popular and powerful computational approach for designing novel structures, materials, and devices. Two computational challenges have limited the applicability of TO to a variety of industrial applications. First, a TO problem often involves a large number of design variables to guarantee sufficient expressive power. Second, many TO problems require a large number of expensive physical model simulations, and those simulations cannot be parallelized. To address these issues, we propose a general scalable deep-learning (DL) based TO framework, referred to as SDL-TO, which utilizes parallel schemes in high performance computing (HPC) to accelerate the TO process for designing additively manufactured (AM) materials. Unlike the existing studies of DL for TO, our framework accelerates TO by learning the iterative history data and simultaneously training on the mapping between the given design and its gradient. The surrogate gradient is learned by utilizing parallel computing on multiple CPUs incorporated with a distributed DL training on multiple GPUs. The learned TO gradient enables a fast online update scheme instead of an expensive update based on the physical simulator or solver. Using a local sampling strategy, we achieve to reduce the intrinsic high dimensionality of the design space and improve the training accuracy and the scalability of the SDL-TO framework. The method is demonstrated by benchmark examples and AM materials design for heat conduction. The proposed SDL-TO framework shows competitive performance compared to the baseline methods but significantly reduces the computational cost by a speed up of around 8.6x over the standard TO implementation.",

However, screening the vast sequence space for categorization of aggregate morphology remains intractable. We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for application-driven peptide discovery.",

    "summary": "Optimal design of experiments for Bayesian inverse problems has recently gained wide popularity and attracted much attention, especially in the computational science and Bayesian inversion communities. An optimal design maximizes a predefined utility function that is formulated in terms of the elements of an inverse problem, an example being optimal sensor placement for parameter identification. The state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches following this simple formulation generally overlook misspecification of the elements of the inverse problem, such as the prior or the measurement uncertainties. This work presents an efficient algorithmic approach for designing optimal experimental design schemes for Bayesian inverse problems such that the optimal design is robust to misspecification of elements of the inverse problem. Specifically, we consider a worst-case scenario approach for the uncertain or misspecified parameters, formulate robust objectives, and propose an algorithmic approach for optimizing such objectives. Both relaxation and stochastic solution approaches are discussed with detailed analysis and insight into the interpretation of the problem and the proposed algorithmic approach. Extensive numerical experiments to validate and analyze the proposed approach are carried out for sensor placement in a parameter identification problem.",

    "summary": "Predicting which hypothetical inorganic crystals can be experimentally realized remains a central challenge in accelerating materials discovery. SyntheFormer is a positive-unlabeled framework that learns synthesizability directly from crystal structure, combining a Fourier-transformed crystal periodicity (FTCP) representation with hierarchical feature extraction, Random-Forest feature selection, and a compact deep MLP classifier. The model is trained on historical data from 2011 through 2018 and evaluated prospectively on future years from 2019 to 2025, where the positive class constitutes only 1.02 per cent of samples. Under this temporally separated evaluation, SyntheFormer achieves a test area under the ROC curve of 0.735 and, with dual-threshold calibration, attains high-recall screening with 97.6 per cent recall at 94.2 per cent coverage, which minimizes missed opportunities while preserving discriminative power. Crucially, the model recovers experimentally confirmed metastable compounds that lie far from the convex hull and simultaneously assigns low scores to many thermodynamically stable yet unsynthesized candidates, demonstrating that stability alone is insufficient to predict experimental attainability. By aligning structure-aware representation with uncertainty-aware decision rules, SyntheFormer provides a practical route to prioritize synthesis targets and focus laboratory effort on the most promising new inorganic materials.",

Classifiers with both structural and compositional features identify domains of applicability, where we expect enhanced accuracy of the regressors. Such regressors are trained to predict key materials properties like, thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), band gap (Eg), and cathode voltage ($ΔV_c$).

Herein, we introduce SPINNER, a highly efficient and reliable structure-prediction framework based on exhaustive random searches and evolutionary algorithms, which is completely free from empiricism. Empowered by accurate neural network potentials, the program can navigate the configuration space faster than DFT by more than 10$^{2}$-fold. In blind tests on 60 ternary compositions diversely selected from the experimental database, SPINNER successfully identifies experimental (or theoretically more stable) phases for ~80% of materials within 5000 generations, entailing up to half a million structure evaluations for each composition. When benchmarked against previous data mining or DFT-based evolutionary predictions, SPINNER identifies more stable phases in the majority of cases. By developing a reliable and fast structure-prediction framework, this work opens the door to large-scale, unbounded computational exploration of undiscovered inorganic crystals.",

Two dominant families of material descriptors exist, one that encodes crystal structure in the representation and the other that only uses stoichiometric information with the hope of discovering new materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular have excelled in predicting material properties within chemical accuracy. However, current GNNs are limited to only one of the above two avenues owing to the little overlap between respective material representations. Here, we introduce a new concept of formula graph which unifies stoichiometry-only and structure-based material descriptors. We further develop a self-attention integrated GNN that assimilates a formula graph and show that the proposed architecture produces material embeddings transferable between the two domains. Our model can outperform some previously proposed structure-agnostic models and their structure-based counterparts while exhibiting better sample efficiency and faster convergence. Finally, the model is applied in a challenging exemplar to predict the complex dielectric function of materials and nominate new substances that potentially exhibit epsilon-near-zero phenomena.",

Such rare materials have traditionally been searched in the general chemical neighborhood of compounds containing metal oxides, expected to be wide gap insulators that might be doped to induce conductivity.Focusing on the family of 18 valence electron ABX compounds we have searched theoretically for the ability of the compound's electronic structure to simultaneously lead to optical transparency, in parallel with the ability of its intrinsic defect structures to produce uncompensated free holes.This led to the prediction of a stable, never before synthesized TaIrGe compound made of all-metal heavy atom compound as the \"best of class\" from the V-IX-IV group. Laboratory synthesis then found it to be stable in the predicted crystal structure and p-type transparent conductor with measured strong direct absorption of 3.36 eV and remarkably high (albeit not predicted) hole mobility of 2730 cm2/Vs at room temperature. This methodology opens the way to future searches of transparent conductors in unexpected chemical groups.",

    "summary": "Despite the extensive usage of oxide glasses for a few millennia, the composition-property relationships in these materials still remain poorly understood. While empirical and physics-based models have been used to predict properties, these remain limited to a few select compositions or a series of glasses. Designing new glasses requires a priori knowledge of how the composition of a glass dictates its properties such as stiffness, density, or processability. Thus, accelerated design of glasses for targeted applications remain impeded due to the lack of universal composition-property models. Herein, using deep learning, we present a methodology for the rational design of oxide glasses. Exploiting a large dataset of glasses comprising of up to 37 oxide components and more than 100,000 glass compositions, we develop high-fidelity deep neural networks for the prediction of eight properties that enable the design of glasses, namely, density, Young's modulus, shear modulus, hardness, glass transition temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, liquidus temperature, and refractive index. These models are by far the most extensive models developed as they cover the entire range of human-made glass compositions. We demonstrate that the models developed here exhibit excellent predictability, ensuring close agreement with experimental observations. Using these models, we develop a series of new design charts, termed as glass selection charts. These charts enable the rational design of functional glasses for targeted applications by identifying unique compositions that satisfy two or more constraints, on both compositions and properties, simultaneously. The generic design approach presented herein could catalyze machine-learning assisted materials design and discovery for a large class of materials including metals, ceramics, and proteins.",

These materials consist of alternating highly doped and intrinsic regions on the scale of several nanometers. This structure enables the creation of potential wells and barriers, implementing a mechanism for filtering carrier energy. Our study demonstrates that by carefully designing the nanostructure, we can significantly enhance its thermoelectric power factor compared to the original pristine material. Importantly, these enhancements stem not only from the energy filtering effect that boosts the Seebeck coefficient but also from the utilization of high-energy carriers within the wells and intrinsic barrier regions to maintain relatively high electronic conductivity. These findings can offer guidance for the design and optimization of new-generation thermoelectric materials through improvements in the power factor.",

The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports multimodal natural language understanding, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To develop more capable models from smaller ones, we report both mixture-of-expert methods and model merging. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse. Additional model fine-tuning with a series of molecular dynamics results demonstrate Cephalo's enhanced capabilities to accurately predict statistical features of stress and atomic energy distributions, as well as crack dynamics and damage in materials.",

    "summary": "The production of hydrogen fuels, via water splitting, is of practical relevance for meeting global energy needs and mitigating the environmental consequences of fossil-fuel-based transportation. Water photoelectrolysis has been proposed as a viable approach for generating hydrogen, provided that stable and inexpensive photocatalysts with conversion efficiencies over 10% can be discovered, synthesized at scale, and successfully deployed (Pinaud et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2013, 6, 1983). While a number of first-principles studies have focused on the data-driven discovery of photocatalysts, in the absence of systematic experimental validation, the success rate of these predictions may be limited. We address this problem by developing a screening procedure with co-validation between experiment and theory to expedite the synthesis, characterization, and testing of the computationally predicted, most desirable materials. Starting with 70,150 compounds in the Materials Project database, the proposed protocol yielded 71 candidate photocatalysts, 11 of which were synthesized as single-phase materials. Experiments confirmed hydrogen generation and favorable band alignment for 6 of the 11 compounds, with the most promising ones belonging to the families of alkali and alkaline-earth indates and orthoplumbates. This study shows the accuracy of a nonempirical, Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory method to predict band gaps and band offsets at a fraction of the computational cost of hybrid functionals, and outlines an effective strategy to identify photocatalysts for solar hydrogen generation.",

    "summary": "We report on optical design and applications of hybrid meso-scale devices and materials that combine optical and thermal management functionalities owing to their tailored resonant interaction with light in visible and infrared frequency bands. We outline a general approach to designing such materials, and discuss two specific applications in detail. One example is a hybrid optical-thermal antenna with sub-wavelength light focusing, which simultaneously enables intensity enhancement at the operating wavelength in the visible and reduction of the operating temperature. The enhancement is achieved via light recycling in the form of whispering-gallery modes trapped in an optical microcavity, while cooling functionality is realized via a combination of reduced optical absorption and radiative cooling. The other example is a fabric that is opaque in the visible range yet highly transparent in the infrared, which allows the human body to efficiently shed energy in the form of thermal emission. Such fabrics can find numerous applications for personal thermal management and for buildings energy efficiency improvement.",

    "summary": "The excitonic insulator (EI) is a more than 60-year-old theoretical proposal that yet remains elusive. It is a purely quantum phenomenon involving the spontaneous generation of excitons in quantum mechanics and the spontaneous condensation of excitons in quantum statistics. At this point, the excitons represent the ground state rather than the conventional excited state. Thus, the scarcity of candidate materials is a key factor contributing to the lack of recognized EI to date. In this review, we begin with the birth of EI, presenting the current state of the field and the main challenges it faces. We then focus on recent advances in the discovery and design of EIs based on the first-principles Bethe-Salpeter scheme, in particular the dark-exciton rule guided screening of materials. It not only opens up new avenues for realizing excitonic instability in direct-gap and wide-gap semiconductors, but also leads to the discovery of novel quantum states of matter such as half-EIs and spin-triplet EIs. Finally, we will look ahead to possible research pathways leading to the first recognized EI, both computationally and theoretically.",

    "summary": "The unusual electronic states found in topological materials can enable a new generation of devices and technologies, yet a long-standing challenge has been finding materials without deleterious parallel bulk conduction. This can arise either from defects or thermally activated carriers. Here, I clarify the criteria that materials need to meet to realize transport properties dominated by the topological states, a necessity for a topological device. This is demonstrated for 3-dimensional topological insulators, 3D Dirac materials, and 1D quantum anomalous Hall insulators, though this can be applied to similar systems. The key parameters are electronic band gap, dielectric constant, and carrier effective mass, which dictate under what circumstances (defect density, temperature, etc.) the unwanted bulk state will conduct in parallel to the topological states. As these are fundamentally determined by the basic atomic properties, simple chemical arguments can be used to navigate the phase space to ultimately find improved materials. This will enable rapid identification of new systems with improved properties, which is crucial to design new materials systems and push into a new generation of topological technologies.",

Starting with rare-earth-based ternary halides, we exclude halogens and perform global structure optimization to obtain thermodynamically stable or metastable phases but having an excess of electrons confined inside interstitial cavities. Then, spin-polarized interstitial states are induced by chemical substitution with magnetic lanthanides. To demonstrate the capability of our approach, we test with 11 ternary halides and successfully predict 30 stable and metastable phases of nonmagnetic electrides subject to 3 different stoichiometric categories, and successively 28 magnetic electrides via chemical substitution with Gd. 56 out of these 58 designed electrides are discovered for the first time. Two electride systems, the monoclinic $A$C ($A=$ La, Gd) and the orthorhombic $A_2$Ge ($A=$ Y, Gd), are thoroughly studied to exemplify the set of predicted crystals. Interestingly, both systems turn out to be topological nodal line electrides (TNLE) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and manifest spin-polarized interstitial states in the case of $A=$ Gd. Our work establishes a novel computational approach of functional electrides design and highlights the magnetism and topological phases embedded in electrides.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we demonstrate a computationally efficient new approach based on deep learning (DL) techniques for analysis, design, and optimization of electromagnetic (EM) nanostructures. We use the strong correlation among features of a generic EM problem to considerably reduce the dimensionality of the problem and thus, the computational complexity, without imposing considerable errors. By employing the dimensionality reduction concept using the more recently demonstrated autoencoder technique, we redefine the conventional many-to-one design problem in EM nanostructures into a one-to-one problem plus a much simpler many-to-one problem, which can be simply solved using an analytic formulation. This approach reduces the computational complexity in solving both the forward problem (i.e., analysis) and the inverse problem (i.e., design) by orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches. In addition, it provides analytic formulations that, despite their complexity, can be used to obtain intuitive understanding of the physics and dynamics of EM wave interaction with nanostructures with minimal computation requirements. As a proof-of-concept, we applied such an efficacious method to design a new class of on-demand reconfigurable optical metasurfaces based on phase-change materials (PCM). We envision that the integration of such a DL-based technique with full-wave commercial software packages offers a powerful toolkit to facilitate the analysis, design, and optimization of the EM nanostructures as well as explaining, understanding, and predicting the observed responses in such structures.",

The design process includes building a database composed of published experimental results, applying machine learning methods on the database, identifying the trends of magnetic properties in soft magnetic materials, and accelerating the design of next-generation soft magnetic nanocrystalline materials through the use of numerical optimization. Machine learning regression models were trained to predict magnetic saturation ($B_S$), coercivity ($H_C$) and magnetostriction ($λ$), with a stochastic optimization framework being used to further optimize the corresponding magnetic properties. To verify the feasibility of the machine learning model, several optimized soft magnetic materials -- specified in terms of compositions and thermomechanical treatments -- have been predicted and then prepared and tested, showing good agreement between predictions and experiments, proving the reliability of the designed model. Two rounds of optimization-testing iterations were conducted to search for better properties.",

In this context, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive natural language processing abilities to generate sophisticated computer code for research tasks in various domains. We report the first study on the applicability of LLMs to perform computer experiments on microstructure pattern formation in model materials. In particular, we exploit LLM's ability to generate code for solving various types of phase-field-based partial differential equations (PDEs) that integrate additional physics to model material microstructures. The results indicate that LLMs have a remarkable capacity to generate multi-physics code and can effectively deal with materials microstructure problems up to a certain complexity. However, for complex multi-physics coupled PDEs for which a detailed understanding of the problem is required, LLMs fail to perform the task efficiently, since much more detailed instructions with many iterations of the same query are required to generate the desired output. Nonetheless, at their current stage of development and potential future advancements, LLMs offer a promising outlook for accelerating materials education and research by supporting beginners and experts in their physics-based methodology. We hope this paper will spur further interest to leverage LLMs as a supporting tool in the integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach to materials modeling and design.",

    "summary": "Emerging multi-material 3D printing techniques have paved the way for the rational design of metamaterials with not only complex geometries but also arbitrary distributions of multiple materials within those geometries. Varying the spatial distribution of multiple materials gives rise to many interesting and potentially unique combinations of anisotropic elastic properties. While the availability of a design approach to cover a large portion of all possible combinations of elastic properties is interesting in itself, it is even more important to find the extremely rare designs that lead to highly unusual combinations of material properties (e.g., double-auxeticity and high elastic moduli). Here, we used a random distribution of a hard phase and a soft phase within a regular lattice to study the resulting anisotropic mechanical properties of the network in general and the abovementioned rare designs in particular. The primary challenge to take up concerns the huge number of design parameters and the extreme rarity of such designs. We, therefore, used computational models and deep learning algorithms to create a mapping from the space of design parameters to the space of mechanical properties, thereby (i) reducing the computational time required for evaluating each designand (ii) making the process of evaluating the different designs highly parallelizable. Furthermore, we selected ten designs to be fabricated using polyjet multi-material 3D printing techniques, mechanically tested them, and characterized their behavior using digital image correlation (DIC, 3 designs) to validate the accuracy of our computational models. The results of our simulations show that deep learning-based algorithms can accurately predict the mechanical properties of the different designs, which match the various deformation mechanisms observed in the experiments.",

PAOFLOW is a software tool that constructs tight-binding Hamiltonians from self-consistent electronic wavefunctions by projecting onto a set of atomic orbitals. The electronic structure provides numerous materials properties that otherwise would have to be calculated via phenomenological models. In this paper, we describe recent re-design of the code as well as the new features and improvements in performance. In particular, we have implemented symmetry operations for unfolding equivalent k-points, which drastically reduces the runtime requirements of first principles calculations, and we have provided internal routines of projections onto atomic orbitals enabling generation of real space atomic orbitals. Moreover, we have included models for non-constant relaxation time in electronic transport calculations, doubling the real space dimensions of the Hamiltonian as well as the construction of Hamiltonians directly from analytical models. Importantly, PAOFLOW has been now converted into a Python package, and is streamlined for use directly within other Python codes. The new object oriented design treats PAOFLOWs computational routines as class methods, providing an API for explicit control of each calculation.",

The proposed strategies quite often fail in experiment due to unpredicted traps associated to kinetic slowing down (gelation, glass transition), as well as to competing ordered structures. An additional challenge that theoretical predictions face is the difficulty to encode the desired inter-particle interaction potential with the currently available library of nano- and micron-sized particles. To overcome these issues, we conjugate here SAT-assembly -- a patchy-particle interaction design algorithm based on constrained optimization solvers -- with coarse-grained simulations of DNA nanotechnology to experimentally realize trap-free self-assembly pathways. As a proof of concept we investigate the assembly of the pyrochlore (also known as tetrastack) lattice, a highly coveted 3D crystal lattice due to its promise in construction of optical metamaterials. We confirm the successful assembly with two different patchy DNA origami designs via SAXS as well as SEM visualization of the silica-coated lattice. Our approach offers a versatile modeling pipeline that starts from patchy particles designed in silico and ends with wireframe DNA origami that self-assemble into the desired structure.",

Using density functional theory (DFT) based lattice-parameters and electronic band-energies for 674 non-metallic exfoliable 2D-materials, we generate 226,779 possible heterostructures. We classify these heterostructures into type-I, II and III systems according to Andersons rule, which is based on the relative band-alignments of the non-interacting monolayers. We find that type-II is the most common and the type-III the least common heterostructure type. We subsequently analyze the chemical trends for each heterostructure type in terms of the periodic table of constituent elements. The band alignment data can be also used for identifying photocatalysts and high-work function 2D-metals for contacts. We validate our results by comparing them to experimental data as well as hybrid-functional predictions. Additionally, we carry out DFT calculations of a few selected systems (MoS2/WSe2, MoS2/h-BN, MoSe2/CrI3), to compare the band-alignment description with the predictions from Andersons rule. We develop web-apps to enable users to virtually create combinations of 2D materials and predict their properties. Additionally, we use ML tools to predict band-alignment information for 2D materials. The web-apps, tools and associated data will be distributed through JARVIS-Heterostructure website (https://jarvis.nist.gov/jarvish/). Our analysis, results and the developed web-apps can be applied to the screening and design applications, such as finding novel photocatalysts, photodetectors, and high-work function (WF) 2D-metal contacts.",

    "summary": "Metamaterial thermal energy devices obtained from transformation optics have recently attracted wide attention due to their vast potential in energy storage, thermal harvesting or heat manipulation. However, these devices usually require inhomogeneous and extreme material parameters which are difficult to realize in large-scale applications. Here, we demonstrate a general process to design thermal harvesting devices with available natural materials through optimized composite microstructures. We apply two-scale homogenization theory to obtain effective properties of the microstructures. Optimal Latin hypercube technique, combined with a genetic algorithm, is then implemented on the microstructures to achieve optimized design parameters. The optimized microstructures can accurately approximate the behavior of transformed materials. We design such devices and numerically characterize good thermal-energy harvesting performances. To validate the wide-range application of our approach, we illustrate other types of microstructures that mimic well the constitutive parameters. The approach we propose can be used to design novel thermal harvesting devices available with existing technology, and can also act as a beneficial vehicle to explore other transformation optics enabled designs.",

    "summary": "Data-driven methods, in particular machine learning, can help to speed up the discovery of new materials by finding hidden patterns in existing data and using them to identify promising candidate materials. In the case of superconductors, which are a highly interesting but also a complex class of materials with many relevant applications, the use of data science tools is to date slowed down by a lack of accessible data. In this work, we present a new and publicly available superconductivity dataset ('3DSC'), featuring the critical temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ of superconducting materials additionally to tested non-superconductors. In contrast to existing databases such as the SuperCon database which contains information on the chemical composition, the 3DSC is augmented by the approximate three-dimensional crystal structure of each material. We perform a statistical analysis and machine learning experiments to show that access to this structural information improves the prediction of the critical temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ of materials. Furthermore, we see the 3DSC not as a finished dataset, but we provide ideas and directions for further research to improve the 3DSC in multiple ways. We are confident that this database will be useful in applying state-of-the-art machine learning methods to eventually find new superconductors.",

    "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming education, redefining the role of trainers and coaches in learning environments. In our study, we explore how AI integrates into the design process of learning materials, assessing its impact on efficiency, pedagogical quality, and the evolving role of human trainers and coaches. Through qualitative interviews with professionals in education and corporate training, we identify the following key topics: trainers and coaches increasingly act as facilitators and content moderators rather than primary creators, efficiency gains allow for a stronger strategic focus but at the same time the new tools require new skills. Additionally, we analyze how the anthropomorphism of AI shapes user trust and expectations. From these insights, we derive how tools based on GenAI can successfully be implemented for trainers and coaches on an individual, organizational, systemic, and strategic level.",
