    "summary": "We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal\nmaterials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to\nperform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow\nplanning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we\npropose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as\nMAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a\nScientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to\ngenerate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator\nsynthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a\nforce field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator\ncoordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures\nrobustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,\nphysics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials\ndiscovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in\nstability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models\nwhen evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across\ndiverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous\nmaterials discovery.",
