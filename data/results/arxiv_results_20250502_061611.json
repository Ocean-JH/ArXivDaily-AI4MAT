    "summary": "Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most\ngenerative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom\nwithout any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative\nmodel, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based\ndescriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure\nrepresentation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network\narchitecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete\ngenerative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction,\nthe discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally\npresent a new metric, Fr\\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the\nsymmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff\nagainst recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.
