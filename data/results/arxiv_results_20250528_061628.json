    "summary": "Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to\nadvancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The\ndefining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central\nrole in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal\ngeneration methods either fail to generate materials that display the\nsymmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information\nfrom examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a\nnovel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates\ncrystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals\ninto two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1)\nthe asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the\nwhole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry\ntransformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We\nalso use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations,\nenabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We\nshowcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials\nProject, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and\npredicted properties.",
