    "summary": "Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing\nstructure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image\nprocessing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing\ntechniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks.\nIn this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding\nmicrostructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic\norientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for\nby mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step,\nwhich allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the\ntraining convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs\nwith an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate\nreconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of\n9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256.\nWe show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain\nsizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property\nrelationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial\nconfigurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural\nfingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a\nlow-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress\nresponse, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP\nsimulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network\nmapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a\nsurrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is\nshown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress\nresponse, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.",
