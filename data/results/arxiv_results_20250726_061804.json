    "summary": "The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous\nmetamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,\nwe develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder\n(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with\ntailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this\nwork uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability\ntensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic\nproperties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to\ndirect LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a\nsynthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of\nvolume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of\nthe VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and\ninterpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The\nstudy provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,\ndemonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and\ninverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials\nwith desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made\nopen-access to support further research.",
