    "summary": "Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing\napplications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work\nleverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,\naiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,\nthese methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model\neffectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing\nlimitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or\ncomputationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nFlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified\nmolecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,\ninspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach\nemploys separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter\nsharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate\nfeatures for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous\nlearning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during\ntraining, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during\ninference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior\nperformance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we\nalso empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code\nand data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.",
