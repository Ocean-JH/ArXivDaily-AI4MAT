    "summary": "Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the\nenergy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development\nstill suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics\ntools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face\nsignificant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures\nthat respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative\nalgorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small\nmolecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we\nintroduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to\ngenerate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat\nunit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer\nconnectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855\nDFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized\nmolecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar\nchemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark\nour approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse\nconformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its\nperformance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given\nthese initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level\nstructure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for\npredicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for\ntheir intrinsic structural flexibility.",

Unconditional generation with\ndiffusion models demonstrates limited efficacy in identifying symmetric\ncrystals as the unit cell size increases. CHGGen addresses this limitation\nthrough conditional generation with the inpainting method, which optimizes a\nfraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host\nstructure. We demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical\nsystems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric\nstructures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen\nextends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures,\nparticularly for systems with partial occupancy, surface absorption and\ndefects. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other\ngenerative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials\ndiscovery.",

This concept-oriented synthetic data\napproach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is\na challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average\ngrain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from\nlow-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced\nand demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.",

A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light\nof electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic\ninteractions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using\nfirst-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron\ncorrelation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization\nin the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry,\nwhich reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation\ntransition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the\ncalculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the\nL-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental\nobservations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display\na complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two\ninequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic\ninteractions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and\nantisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the\nmagnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical\naspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase\ndiagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the\nmagnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the\nexperimentally observed phase transformations.",

This encoding reduces the search space\nsubstantially by exploiting the symmetry in space groups. When CRYSIM is\ninterfaced to Fixstars Amplify, a GPU-based Ising machine, its prediction\nperformance was competitive with CALYPSO and Bayesian optimization for crystals\ncontaining more than 150 atoms in a unit cell.

Machine learning-based image\nprocessing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing\ntechniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks.\nIn this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding\nmicrostructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic\norientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for\nby mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step,\nwhich allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the\ntraining convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs\nwith an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate\nreconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of\n9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256.\nWe show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain\nsizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property\nrelationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial\nconfigurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural\nfingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a\nlow-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress\nresponse, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP\nsimulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network\nmapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a\nsurrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is\nshown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress\nresponse, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.",

By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data\naugmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse\nand small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials\nsimultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation\nenergy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically\nand lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and\ncubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their\nthermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability\nfor thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents\na significant step forward in generative design of inorganic materials.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions\nhave demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding\nthrough autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical\nrole of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science,\nthese tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods\nremaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction.\nAt its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses\n3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It\nthen applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details,\ncapturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in\nmicroscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance\nefficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression\nstrategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a\nmasked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token\npositions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these\nstrategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single\nautoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D\nGU tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its\neffectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to\n256\\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x\nfaster. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-3DAR.",

However, most AI-for-Materials\nresearch to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials\ninevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional\ntechnologies. The defects and dopants break geometric symmetry and increase\ninteraction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models.\nAddressing these challenges requires models that are able to capture sparse\ndefect-driven effects in crystals while maintaining adaptability and precision.\nHere, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet),\na model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions\nand geometric configurations in point-defect structures. Trained on 14,866\ndefect structures, DefiNet achieves highly accurate structural predictions in a\nsingle step, avoiding the time-consuming iterative processes in modern ML\nrelaxation models and possible error accumulation from iteration. We further\nvalidates DefiNet's accuracy by using density functional theory (DFT)\nrelaxation on DefiNet-predicted structures. For most defect structures,\nregardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required\nto reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability\nand extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a groundbreaking tool\nfor defect-focused materials research.",

    "summary": "The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of\nelectrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the\nanomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio\nevolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under\npressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O\nstructure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above\n900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an\ninstantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \\approx 0.001 \\mu_B$).\nMoreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer\nat 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the\nhydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters\nwithin the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the\nhydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive\nsuperionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic\nfields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as \"thermal-induced ion\nmagnetic moments\". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three\ndirections. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the\nsystem becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to\nre-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under\nhigh pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and\nNeptune.",

Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic\nstructure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect\ndue to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the\npresence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange\ninteraction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the\nstrain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field\ntheory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of\nNa$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the\ntrigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted\nhybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators,\nresulting in tunability of $\\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively.\nOur results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation\neffects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in\nthis and related materials.",

    "summary": "Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal\nstructures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering\nnovel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as\nproteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored\narea due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this\npaper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address\nCSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary\nfoundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy\nprediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that\nour DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all\nmetrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in\ngenerating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and\nenergy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's\nperformance. When applied to three real-world superconductors\n($\\text{CsV}_3\\text{Sb}_5$, $ \\text{Zr}_{16}\\text{Rh}_8\\text{O}_4$ and\n$\\text{Zr}_{16}\\text{Pd}_8\\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to\nanalyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature\npredictions and structure generations. For instance, on\n$\\text{CsV}_3\\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the\nexperimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with\nhigh accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast,\nconventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the\nstructure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE\nis nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times\nslower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our\napproach for advancing materials science research and development.",

Existing approaches\nprimarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models,\neach offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations.\nAutoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated\nremarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to\nmultimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like\nVQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their\ndirect application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high\nprecision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other\nhand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data,\nsuch as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy.\nYet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as\ngeneral-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we\npropose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token\nprediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the\nstrengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional\ndiffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision\nof autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on\nmaterial and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in\nstate-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and\nestablishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure\nprediction, de novo design, and conditional generation.

Our approach\nintegrates global structural knowledge through textual descriptions at each\ndenoising step while jointly generating atom coordinates, types, and lattice\nstructure using a periodic-E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN).\nExtensive experiments using popular datasets on benchmark tasks reveal that\nTGDMat outperforms existing baseline methods by a good margin. Notably, for the\nstructure prediction task, with just one generated sample, TGDMat outperforms\nall baseline models, highlighting the importance of text-guided diffusion.\nFurther, in the generation task, TGDMat surpasses all baselines and their\ntext-fusion variants, showcasing the effectiveness of the joint diffusion\nparadigm. Additionally, incorporating textual knowledge reduces overall\ntraining and sampling computational overhead while enhancing generative\nperformance when utilizing real-world textual prompts from experts.",

Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the\nneed for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate\ntraining data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional\ntheory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent\ndevelopments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science\nalongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising\npath forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of\ndescribing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with\nsub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\\sim 200$ data structures; an order of\nmagnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this\nframework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting\nfor anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy\nwith respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be\ngeneralized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and\naspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the\ncase of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this\nwork paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological\nsystems.",

    "summary": "The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th\ncentury, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the\nmicroscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures\nand phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the\nneed for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of\ncomplex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first\nalgorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to\ncomputational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family\nof differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics --\nand assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall\ndiversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis\nat scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine\nlearning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein\nuniverse, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that\nAlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute\nmost to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database\nled to similar findings: more than $85\\%$ of the crystals with formation energy\ndata are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance\ndiversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as\nmemorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized\ntraining samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the\nbest-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least\nto diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a\npowerful tool for data-driven science.",

Universal machine learning interatomic\npotentials (uMLIPs) offer a promising solution with their efficiency and\nnear-DFT-level accuracy.This study systematically evaluates six advanced uMLIP\nmodels (MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, CHGNet, M3GNet, and ORBFF) in terms of\nenergy, forces, thermodynamic properties, elastic moduli, and lithium-ion\ndiffusion behavior. The results show that MatterSim outperforms others in\nnearly all metrics, particularly in complex material systems, demonstrating\nsuperior accuracy and physical consistency. Other models exhibit significant\ndeviations due to issues like energy inconsistency or insufficient training\ndata coverage.Further analysis reveals that MatterSim achieves excellent\nagreement with reference values in lithium-ion diffusivity calculations,\nespecially at room temperature. Studies on Li3YCl6 and Li6PS5Cl uncover how\ncrystal structure, anion disorder levels, and Na/Li arrangements influence\nionic conductivity.

    "summary": "Recent advancements in AI have revolutionized property prediction in\nmaterials science and accelerating material discovery. Graph neural networks\n(GNNs) stand out due to their ability to represent crystal structures as\ngraphs, effectively capturing local interactions and delivering superior\npredictions. However, these methods often lose critical global information,\nsuch as crystal systems and repetitive unit connectivity. To address this, we\npropose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal fusion model that integrates\ngraph and text modalities to preserve essential material information. CAST\ncombines node- and token-level features using cross-attention mechanisms,\nsurpassing previous approaches reliant on material-level embeddings like graph\nmean-pooling or [CLS] tokens. A masked node prediction pretraining strategy\nfurther enhances atomic-level information integration. Our method achieved up\nto 22.9\\% improvement in property prediction across four crystal properties\nincluding band gap compared to methods like CrysMMNet and MultiMat. Pretraining\nwas key to aligning node and text embeddings, with attention maps confirming\nits effectiveness in capturing relationships between nodes and tokens. This\nstudy highlights the potential of multimodal learning in materials science,\npaving the way for more robust predictive models that incorporate both local\nand global information.",

    "summary": "Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to\nadvancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The\ndefining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central\nrole in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal\ngeneration methods either fail to generate materials that display the\nsymmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information\nfrom examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a\nnovel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates\ncrystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals\ninto two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1)\nthe asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the\nwhole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry\ntransformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We\nalso use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations,\nenabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We\nshowcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials\nProject, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and\npredicted properties.",

However,\nin an actual stacking procedure, stacking faults can follow curve line along\nthe slip plane rather than constrained to straight lines. In this study, using\nab initio calculations, we mapped the {\\gamma}-surface, defined as the\nlandscape of generalized stacking fault energies, along the weakest direction\nof the {111} orientation in diamond. We then applied the Nudged Elastic Band\n(NEB) method to determine the minimum energy paths, finding significantly\nreduced stacking energy barriers compared to previous reports (for the\nglide-set, our energy barrier is only one-third of that for the traditional\ndirect path). Our calculations reveal that the glide-set can round its\nhigh-energy peak, with a lower energy barrier within the entire stacking plane\nthan the shuffle-set. By employing the NEB method, we have constructed the\nminimum energy path (MEP) for both the stacking and dislocation procedures.

    "summary": "The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological\nadvancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must\neffectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite\ndesign space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMG), a unifying\nframework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline\nmaterials. OMG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base\ndistribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class\nof tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow\nmatching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by\nintegrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and\nextending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell\nrepresentations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates\nand lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We\nbenchmark OMG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)\nfor specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering\nstable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMG,\nwe refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMG\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art in generative modeling for materials\ndiscovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.\nThese results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning\nframeworks to accelerate progress in materials science.",

    "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials\ndiscovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this\nwork, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration\nof charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds -\nagainst three generative models: a variational autoencoder, a large language\nmodel, and a diffusion model. Our results show that established methods such as\nion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although\nmany of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast,\ngenerative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when\nsufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties\nsuch as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability\nrate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative\napproaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed\nstructures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained\nmachine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This\nlow-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates\nof all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a\npractical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials\ndiscovery.",

    "summary": "Generative model for 2D materials has shown significant promise in\naccelerating the material discovery process. The stability and performance of\nthese materials are strongly influenced by their underlying symmetry. However,\nexisting generative models for 2D materials often neglect symmetry constraints,\nwhich limits both the diversity and quality of the generated structures. Here,\nwe introduce a symmetry-constrained diffusion model (SCDM) that integrates\nspace group symmetry into the generative process. By incorporating Wyckoff\npositions, the model ensures adherence to symmetry principles, leading to the\ngeneration of 2,000 candidate structures. DFT calculations were conducted to\nevaluate the convex hull energies of these structures after structural\nrelaxation. From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy\nstability criteria (Ehull < 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six\ncandidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band\nstructure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which\nexhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a\nsymmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure\nprediction model. The results highlight that incorporating symmetry constraints\nenhances the effectiveness of generated 2D materials, making a contribution to\nthe discovery of 2D materials through generative modeling.",

    "summary": "Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and\nsurface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically\nexhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these\ntraces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it\ngenerally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT)\nmodel that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive\nand quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be\nharnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of\nsynthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large\nspan of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with\nit. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally\noutput the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route\nstep by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most\ninstructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met\nunexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the\nNN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and\naugmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra\nefforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to\nthe sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials\nsubstrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to\nrationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.",

    "summary": "Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of\namorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune\nfeatures of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to\nspecific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the\nstructure. This has been understood through the notion of independent\nbond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs\nhave different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated\ninverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified\nin a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse\ndesign. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the\nsimultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much\nstronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the\nmechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across\na wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable\nparameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our\nformulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter\nchanges, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability.\nThese results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference\nbetween ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to\nboth understand and perform inverse design.",

While stability metrics such as formation energy\noffer partial insights, they fail to account for kinetic factors and\ntechnological constraints that influence synthesis outcomes. These challenges\nare further compounded by the scarcity of negative data, as failed synthesis\nattempts are often unpublished or context-specific.\n  We present SynCoTrain, a semi-supervised machine learning model designed to\npredict the synthesizability of materials.

By iteratively exchanging predictions between classifiers,\nSynCoTrain mitigates model bias and enhances generalizability. Our approach\nuses Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning to address the absence of explicit\nnegative data, iteratively refining predictions through collaborative learning.\n  The model demonstrates robust performance, achieving high recall on internal\nand leave-out test sets.

    "summary": "Discovering new solid-state materials requires rapidly exploring the vast\nspace of crystal structures and locating stable regions. Generating stable\nmaterials with desired properties and compositions is extremely difficult as we\nsearch for very small isolated pockets in the exponentially many possibilities,\nconsidering elements from the periodic table and their 3D arrangements in\ncrystal lattices. Materials discovery necessitates both optimized solution\nstructures and diversity in the generated material structures. Existing methods\nstruggle to explore large material spaces and generate diverse samples with\ndesired properties and requirements. We propose the Symmetry-aware Hierarchical\nArchitecture for Flow-based Traversal (SHAFT), a novel generative model\nemploying a hierarchical exploration strategy to efficiently exploit the\nsymmetry of the materials space to generate crystal structures given desired\nproperties. In particular, our model decomposes the exponentially large\nmaterials space into a hierarchy of subspaces consisting of symmetric space\ngroups, lattice parameters, and atoms. We demonstrate that SHAFT significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art iterative generative methods, such as Generative\nFlow Networks (GFlowNets) and Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoders\n(CDVAE), in crystal structure generation tasks, achieving higher validity,\ndiversity, and stability of generated structures optimized for target\nproperties and requirements.",

    "summary": "For a very long time, computational approaches to the design of new materials\nhave relied on an iterative process of finding a candidate material and\nmodeling its properties. AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping\nto accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and\nstructures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven\napproaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the\nprocess of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches\nto the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse\nproblem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without\nutilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1)\nconditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an\narbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most\nenergetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2)\nconditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that\nincludes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types,\nchemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss\nfunction was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of\ncrystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching,\nusual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches.\nAs a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare\ntarget structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our\nmodifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy\n41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency,\ninference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new\nstructures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.",

    "summary": "Machine-learning interatomic potential models based on graph neural network\narchitectures have the potential to make atomistic materials modeling widely\naccessible due to their computational efficiency, scalability, and broad\napplicability. The training datasets for many such models are derived from\ndensity-functional theory calculations, typically using a semilocal\nexchange-correlation functional. As a result, long-range interactions such as\nLondon dispersion are often missing in these models. We investigate whether\nthis missing component can be addressed by combining a graph deep learning\npotential with semiempirical dispersion models. We assess this combination by\nderiving the equations of state for layered pnictogen chalcohalides BiTeBr and\nBiTeI and performing crystal structure optimizations for a broader set of\nV-VI-VII compounds with various stoichiometries, many of which possess van der\nWaals gaps. We characterize the optimized crystal structures by calculating\ntheir X-ray diffraction patterns and radial distribution function histograms,\nwhich are also used to compute Earth mover's distances to quantify the\ndissimilarity between the optimized and corresponding experimental structures.\nWe find that dispersion-corrected graph deep learning potentials generally\n(though not universally) provide a more realistic description of these\ncompounds due to the inclusion of van der Waals attractions. In particular,\ntheir use results in systematic improvements in predicting not only the van der\nWaals gap but also the layer thickness in layered V-VI-VII compounds. Our\nresults demonstrate that the combined potentials studied here, derived from a\nstraightforward approach that neither requires fine-tuning the training nor\nrefitting the potential parameters, can significantly improve the description\nof layered polar crystals.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models\n(LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline\nmaterials. FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base\ndistribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting\nto a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and\niteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation\nrate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for\nstable, unique, and novel crystals by $\\sim50\\%$ - a huge improvement on a\ndifficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much\ncloser to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model,\nsignificantly reducing post-hoc computational cost.",

However, spatial symmetry, which\nserves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the\ndesign process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry,\npotentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional\nmaterials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of\nSLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and\ngeneration have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and\nrobustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES.\nFurthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we\nhave demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical\nproperties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore\nautoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot\nlearning.

    "summary": "Meso-scale calculations of pore collapse and hotspot formation in energetic\ncrystals provide closure models to macro-scale hydrocodes for predicting the\nshock sensitivity of energetic materials. To this end, previous works obtained\natomistics-consistent material models for two common energetic crystals, HMX\nand RDX, such that pore collapse calculations adhered closely to molecular\ndynamics (MD) results on key features of energy localization, particularly the\nprofiles of the collapsing pores, appearance of shear bands, and the transition\nfrom viscoplastic to hydrodynamic collapse. However, some important aspects\nsuch as the temperature distributions in the hotspot were not as well captured.\nOne potential issue was noted but not resolved adequately in those works,\nnamely the grid resolution that should be employed in the meso-scale\ncalculations for various pore sizes and shock strengths. Conventional\ncomputational mechanics guidelines for selecting meshes as fine as possible,\nbalancing computational effort, accuracy and grid independence, were shown not\nto produce physically consistent features associated with shear localization.\nHere, we examine the physics of pore collapse, shear band evolution and\nstructure, and hotspot formation, for both HMX and RDX; we then evaluate under\nwhat conditions atomistics-consistent models yield physically correct\n(considering MD as ground truth) hotspots for a range of pore diameters, from\nnm to microns, and for a wide range of shock strengths. The study provides\ninsights into the effects of pore size and shock strength on pore collapse and\nhotspots, identifying aspects such as size-independent behaviors, and\nproportion of energy contained in shear as opposed to jet impact-heated regions\nof the hotspot. Areas for further improvement of atomistics-consistent material\nmodels are also indicated.",

In this work, we\ngeneralize the concept of multihyperuniformity (MH), an exotic state that can\nexist in a disordered multi-component system, to two-dimensional materials\nMXenes. Disordered hyperuniform systems possess an isotropic local structure\nthat lacks traditional translational and orientational order, yet they\ncompletely suppress infinite-wavelength density fluctuations as in perfect\ncrystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range order. In particular,\nwe evaluate the static structure factor of the individual components present in\nthe high entropy (HE) MXene experimental sample TiVCMoCr based on high-solution\nSEM imaging data, which suggests this HE MXene system is at least effectively\nmultihyperuniform. We then devise a packing algorithm to generate\nmultihyperuniform models of HE MXene systems. The MH HE MXenes are predicted to\nbe energetically more stable compared to the prevailing (quasi)random models of\nthe HE MXenes due to the hidden long-range order. Moreover, the MH structure\nexhibits a distinctly smaller lattice distortion, which has a vital effect on\nthe electronic properties of HE MXenes, such as the density of states and\ncharge distribution. This systematic study of HE MXenes strengthens our\nfundamental understanding of these systems, and suggests possible exotic\nphysical properties, as endowed by the multihyperuniformity.",

Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building\nblocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and\nstrength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$.\nMonolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and\nfullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and\nlarge surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic\nband gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band\nedges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the\nacidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption\nenabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively,\nwhile the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can\nseparate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally,\nthe number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more\nthan that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing\nspontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction.

A more general description\nof the structural characteristics of atomic systems is obtained using complete\nsets of atomic environment descriptors. These are used within for generating\nrepresentative atomic structures without restriction to fixed lattices. A\ngeneral data-driven approach is provided utilizing the atomic cluster\nexpansion(ACE) basis. The N-body ACE descriptors are a complete set of atomic\nenvironment descriptors that span both chemical and spatial degrees of freedom\nand are used within for describing atomic structures. The generalized\nrepresentative structure(GRS) method presented within generates small atomic\nstructures that reproduce ACE descriptor distributions corresponding to\narbitrary structural and chemical complexity. It is shown that systematically\nimprovable representations of crystalline systems on fixed parent lattices,\namorphous materials, liquids, and ensembles of atomic structures may be\nproduced efficiently through optimization algorithms. We highlight reduced\nrepresentations of atomistic machine-learning training datasets that contain\nsimilar amounts of information and small 40-72 atom representations of liquid\nphases. The ability to use GRS methodology as a driver for informed novel\nstructure generation is also demonstrated. The advantages over other\ndata-driven methods and state-of-the-art methods restricted to high-symmetry\nsystems are highlighted.",

In applications of\ngenerative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal\nstructures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level\ninstructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate\ncrystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate\nend-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for\ncontrollable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language\nmodel that takes high-level natural language as input and generates\nintermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and\n(2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and\ngenerates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally\nuses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from\nthe generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three\ncomponents to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible\nstructures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of\ndirectly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user\nrequest and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able\nto generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels,\nsolely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more\ncomplex structure generation in near future.",

The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for\nboth training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach\nspeeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also\napply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN\ngeneralizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts\nthe von Mises stress on polycrystals.

    "summary": "The crystal structure can be simplified as a periodic point set repeating\nacross the entire three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice.\nTraditionally, methods for representing crystals rely on descriptors like\nlattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups to characterize the structure.\nHowever, in reality, atoms in material always vibrate above absolute zero,\ncausing continuous fluctuations in their positions. This dynamic behavior\ndisrupts the underlying periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based\non static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under\neven slight perturbations. To this end, chemists proposed the Pairwise Distance\nDistribution (PDD) method, which has been used to distinguish all periodic\nstructures in the world's largest real materials collection, the Cambridge\nStructural Database. However, achieving the completeness of PDD requires\ndefining a large number of neighboring atoms, resulting in high computational\ncosts. Moreover, it does not account for atomic information, making it\nchallenging to directly apply PDD to crystal material property prediction\ntasks. To address these challenges, we propose the atom-Weighted Pairwise\nDistance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution\n(UPDD) for the first time, incorporating them into the construction of\nmulti-edge crystal graphs.

    "summary": "In a recent class of phase field crystal (PFC) models, the density order\nparameter is coupled to powers of its mean field. This effectively introduces a\nphenomenology of higher-order direct correlation functions acting on long\nwavelengths, which is required for modelling solid-liquid-vapor systems. The\npresent work generalizes these models by incorporating, into a single-field\ntheory, higher-order direct correlations, systematically constructed in\nreciprocal space to operate across long {\\it and} short wavelengths. The\ncorrelation kernels introduced are also readily adaptable to describe distinct\ncrystal structures. We examine the three-phase equilibrium properties and phase\ndiagrams of the proposed model, and reproduce parts of the aluminum phase\ndiagram as an example of its versatile parametrization. We assess the dynamics\nof the model, showing that it allows robust control of the interface energy\nbetween the vapor and condensed phases (liquid and solid). We also examine the\ndynamics of solid-vapor interfaces over a wide range of parameters and find\nthat dynamical artifacts reported in previous PFC models do not occur in the\npresent formalism. Additionally, we demonstrate the capacity of the proposed\nformalism for computing complex microstructures and defects such as\ndislocations, grain boundaries, and voids in solid-liquid-vapor systems, all of\nwhich are expected to be crucial for investigating rapid solidification\nprocesses.",

    "summary": "The phase-field crystal (PFC) model describes crystal structures at diffusive\ntimescales through a periodic, microscopic density field. It has been proposed\nto model elasticity in crystal growth and encodes most of the phenomenology\nrelated to the mechanical properties of crystals like dislocation nucleation\nand motion, grain boundaries, and elastic or interface-energy anisotropies. To\novercome limitations to small systems, a coarse-grained formulation focusing on\nslowly varying complex amplitudes of the microscopic density field has been\ndevised. This amplitude-PFC (APFC) model describes well elasticity and\ndislocations while approximating microscopic features and being limited in\ndescribing large-angle grain boundaries. We present here seminal concepts for a\nhybrid multiscale PFC-APFC framework that combines the coarse-grained\ndescription of the APFC model in bulk-like crystallites while exploiting PFC\nresolution at dislocations, grain boundaries, and interfaces or surfaces. This\nis achieved by coupling the two models via an advanced discretization based on\nthe Fourier spectral method and allowing for local solution updates. This\ndiscretization also generalizes the description of boundary conditions for PFC\nmodels. We showcase the framework capabilities through two-dimensional\nbenchmark simulations. We also show that the proposed formulation allows for\novercoming the limitations of the APFC model in describing large-angle grain\nboundaries.",

Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue:\nSelf-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent\nHarmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods\nthat fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics\ntrajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP).\nDespite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often\noverlooked in the proximity of critical points.\n  Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on\ncritical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static\ncorrelation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours,\nand dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal\ntransport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation\nof dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the\nstandard TDEP approach.\n  Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic\npotential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and\nthe metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.",

We\nhave extended the conventional design principle by uncovering that many of the\nanionic frameworks of Ag-ion conductors are characterized by tetrahedrally\npacked (TP) structures. Leveraging our findings, we have virtually screened TP\nframework compounds, uncovering their intrinsic potential for superior ionic\nconductivity through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our\ndesign principle is applicable to Ag$^+$ and other mobile ions, including\nLi$^+$ and F$^-$. We proposed the Met2Ion method to generate ionic crystal\nstructures using metal crystal structures as templates and demonstrated that\nnew ionic conductors with TP frameworks can be discovered.

    "summary": "Effectively representing materials as text has the potential to leverage the\nvast advancements of large language models (LLMs) for discovering new\nmaterials. While LLMs have shown remarkable success in various domains, their\napplication to materials science remains underexplored. A fundamental challenge\nis the lack of understanding of how to best utilize text-based representations\nfor materials modeling. This challenge is further compounded by the absence of\na comprehensive benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities and\nlimitations of these text representations in capturing the complexity of\nmaterial systems. To address this gap, we propose MatText, a suite of\nbenchmarking tools and datasets designed to systematically evaluate the\nperformance of language models in modeling materials. MatText encompasses nine\ndistinct text-based representations for material systems, including several\nnovel representations. Each representation incorporates unique inductive biases\nthat capture relevant information and integrate prior physical knowledge about\nmaterials. Additionally, MatText provides essential tools for training and\nbenchmarking the performance of language models in the context of materials\nscience. These tools include standardized dataset splits for each\nrepresentation, probes for evaluating sensitivity to geometric factors, and\ntools for seamlessly converting crystal structures into text. Using MatText, we\nconduct an extensive analysis of the capabilities of language models in\nmodeling materials. Our findings reveal that current language models\nconsistently struggle to capture the geometric information crucial for\nmaterials modeling across all representations. Instead, these models tend to\nleverage local information, which is emphasized in some of our novel\nrepresentations. Our analysis underscores MatText's ability to reveal\nshortcomings of text-based methods for materials design.",

As a result, the Fermi energy is pinned due to symmetry, yielding an\ninvariant zero gap. Utilizing the hybrid pseudopotentials to correct the\nunderestimation on the atomic side opens up gaps of experimental magnitude in\nCu$_{2}X$, suggesting their predominantly electronic nature. Our work not only\nclarifies the debate about the Cu$_{2}X$ gap, but also provides a way to\nidentify which of the different methods really captures the physical essence\nand which is the result of error cancellation.",

Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a\nvanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key\nindicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental\ntasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known\ncomposition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their\nstable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more\nflexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit\nthe symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and\nperiodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the\nflow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning\ncrystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard\nbenchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry\ncalculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of\nintegration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open\nmethods.",

    "summary": "Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$)\nprovides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing\ntransition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating\nself-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are\nparticularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic\nstates. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate\ndetermination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In\npractice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior\nknowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive\nfirst-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based\non equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as\ndescriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical\nenvironment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the\nprediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative\nlinear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation\ntheory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data\nfrom 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our\nmodel achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and\n$V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or\nDFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the\nprediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while\napproaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust\ntransferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and\ndesign via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various\ntechnological applications.",

The success of state-of-the-art models stems\nfrom their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation,\nrotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called\nResponse Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or\nmolecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently,\nany perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure\nback to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score\nmatching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine\nlearning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising\nmodel, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects\npermutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first\nmodel to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a\nsmall organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project,\nand one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.",

However, selective polymorph\ncrystallization during conventional thin film synthesis is not trivial; e.g.\nopting for step-like changes of temperature and/or pressure correlated with\nswitching from one polymorph to another during synthesis is tricky, since it\nmay cause degradation of the structural quality. In the present work, applying\nthe disorder-induced ordering approach we fabricated such multilayered\npolymorph structures using ion beams. We show that during ion irradiation of\ngallium oxide, the dynamic annealing of disorder may be tuned towards\nself-assembling of several polymorph interfaces, consistently with theoretical\nmodelling. Specifically, we demonstrated multilayers with two polymorph\ninterface repetitions obtained in one ion beam assisted fabrication step.\nImportantly, single crystal structure of the polymorphs was maintained in\nbetween interfaces exhibiting repeatable crystallographic relationships,\ncorrelating with optical cross-sectional maps. This data paves the way for\nenhancing functionalities in materials with not previously thought capabilities\nof ion beam technology.",

    "summary": "The prototypical $\\alpha\\to\\omega$ phase transition in zirconium is an ideal\ntest-bed for our understanding of polymorphism under extreme loading\nconditions. After half a century of study, a consensus had emerged that the\ntransition is realized via one of two distinct displacive mechanisms, depending\non the nature of the compression path. However, recent dynamic-compression\nexperiments equipped with in situ diffraction diagnostics performed in the past\nfew years have revealed new transition mechanisms, demonstrating that our\nunderstanding of the underlying atomistic dynamics and transition kinetics is\nin fact far from complete. We present classical molecular dynamics simulations\nof the $\\alpha\\to\\omega$ phase transition in single-crystal zirconium\nshock-compressed along the [0001] axis using a machine-learning-class\npotential. The transition is predicted to proceed primarily via a modified\nversion of the two-stage Usikov-Zilberstein mechanism, whereby the\nhigh-pressure $\\omega$-phase heterogeneously nucleates at boundaries between\ngrains of an intermediate $\\beta$-phase. We further observe the fomentation of\natomistic disorder at the junctions between $\\beta$ grains, leading to the\nformation of highly defective interstitial material between the $\\omega$\ngrains. We directly compare synthetic x-ray diffraction patterns generated from\nour simulations with those obtained using femtosecond diffraction in recent\ndynamic-compression experiments, and show that the simulations produce the same\nunique, anisotropic diffuse scattering signal unlike any previously seen from\nan elemental metal. Our simulations suggest that the diffuse signal arises from\na combination of thermal diffuse scattering, nanoparticle-like scattering from\nresidual kinetically stabilized $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ grains, and scattering\nfrom interstitial defective structures.",

    "summary": "The crystallographic texture is a key organization feature of many technical\nand biological materials. In these materials, especially hierarchically\nstructured ones, the preferential alignment of the nano constituents is heavily\ninfluencing the macroscopic behaviour of the material. In order to study local\ncrystallographic texture with both high spatial and angular resolution, we\ndeveloped Texture tomography (TexTOM). This approach allows to model the\ndiffraction data of polycrystalline materials by using the full reciprocal\nspace of the ensemble of crystals and describe the texture in each voxel via a\norientation distribution function. This means, it provides 3D reconstructions\nof the local texture by measuring the probabilities of all crystal\norientations. The TexTOM approach addresses limitations associated with\nexisting models: It correlates the intensities from several Bragg reflections,\nthus reduces ambiguities resulting from symmetry. Further, it yields\nquantitative probability distributions of local real space crystal orientations\nwithout further assumptions on the sample structure. Finally, its efficient\nmathematical formulation enables reconstructions faster than the time-scale of\nthe experiment. In this manuscript, we present the mathematical model, the\ninversion strategy and its current experimental implementation. We show\ncharacterizations of simulated data as well as experimental data obtained from\na synthetic, inorganic model sample, the silica-witherite biomorph. In\nconclusion, Tex-TOM provides a versatile framework to reconstruct 3D\nquantitative texture information for polycrystalline samples. In this way, it\nopens the door for unprecedented insights into the nanostructural makeup of\nnatural and technical materials.",

It is well established that deuteration affects the\ninterplay of hydrogen-bond switches and heavy ion displacements that underlie\nthe emergence of macroscopic polarization, but a detailed microscopic model is\nmissing. Here we show that all-atom path integral molecular dynamics\nsimulations can predict the isotope effects, revealing the microscopic\nmechanism that differentiates KDP and DKDP. Proton tunneling in the hydrogen\nbonds generates phosphate configurations that do not contribute to the\npolarization. These dipolar defects are always present in KDP, but disappear at\nlow temperatures in DKDP, which behaves more classically. Quantum disorder\nconfers residual entropy to ferroelectric KDP, explaining its lower spontaneous\npolarization and transition entropy relative to DKDP. Tunneling should also\ncontribute to the anomalous heat capacity observed in KDP near absolute zero.\nThe prominent role of quantum fluctuations in KDP is related to the unusual\nstrength of the hydrogen bonds in this system and should be equally important\nin the other crystals of the KDP family, which exhibit similar isotope effects.",

    "summary": "Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made\nsignificant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and\ntransport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial\nresolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and\nelectron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample\npreparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate\ntheoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer\nsimulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a\nrapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such\nas electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs,\nnanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and\ncomputational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur\nwhen charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single\nand collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the\ngeneration of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the\nirradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio\nmethods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion\nsystems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in\nenergy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for\nthe accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative\napproach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and\nsecondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and\ndielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of\nirradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological\nsignificance.",

For the second model, we develop a\nnew set of descriptors based on symmetry functions combined with a point-vector\nrepresentation of the molecules, encoding information about the positions as\nwell as relative orientations of the molecule. We demonstrate very high\nclassification accuracy for both approaches on urea and nicotinamide crystal\npolymorphs, and practical applications to the analysis of dynamical trajectory\ndata for nanocrystals and solid-solid interfaces. Both architectures are\napplicable to a wide range of molecules and diverse topologies, providing an\nessential step in the exploration of complex condensed matter phenomena.",

Nontrivial topological properties have been found\nin two of them, with a stoichiometry of C4BN and C2(BN)2. The former C4BN is\npredicted to be a type-II Dirac semimetal with a superconducting critical\ntemperature Tc=0.38K, which is similar to the pure carbon biphenylene network\n(C-BPN). The latter shows a novel isolated edge state exists between the\nconduction and valence bands. By regulation of strains and virtual-crystal\napproximation calculations, we found the annihilation of two pairs of Dirac\npoints (DPs) in the non-high symmetric region (non-HSR) causes the two\ncorresponding edge states stick together to generate this isolated edge state.\nIn addition, we found that one pair of DPs arises from the shift of DPs in the\nC-BPN, while another new pair of DPs emerges around the Time Reversal Invariant\nMomenta (TRIM) point X due to the doping of boron and nitrogen. We constructed\na tight-binding (TB) model to reveal the mechanism of forming the isolated edge\nstate from the C-BPN to C2(BN)2. This study not only demonstrates the existence\nand mechanism of forming the isolated edge state in semimetals, but also\nprovides an example in which the DPs can move away from the high-symmetry\nregion.",

    "summary": "While density functional theory (DFT) serves as a prevalent computational\napproach in electronic structure calculations, its computational demands and\nscalability limitations persist. Recently, leveraging neural networks to\nparameterize the Kohn-Sham DFT Hamiltonian has emerged as a promising avenue\nfor accelerating electronic structure computations. Despite advancements,\nchallenges such as the necessity for computing extensive DFT training data to\nexplore each new system and the complexity of establishing accurate ML models\nfor multi-elemental materials still exist. Addressing these hurdles, this study\nintroduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian\nmatrices obtained from first-principles DFT calculations of nearly all crystal\nstructures on the Materials Project. We demonstrate its generality in\npredicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including\ncomplex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\\'e twisted\nbilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we\nutilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of\nelectronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940\ncrystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering\na reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this\nuniversal Hamiltonian model lays the groundwork for advancements in diverse\nfields, such as easily providing a huge data set of electronic structures and\nalso making the materials design across the whole periodic table possible.",

In this work, we analyze\nthe effect of electronic heating on the dynamic structure factor (DSF) in bulk\nAluminium (Al) with a face-centered cubic lattice and in silicon (Si) with a\ncrystal diamond structure using first-principles linear-response time-dependent\ndensity functional theory simulations. We find a thermally induced red shift of\nthe collective plasmon excitation in both materials. In addition, we show that\nthe heating of the electrons in Al can lead to the formation of a\ndouble-plasmon peak due to the extension of the Landau damping region to\nsmaller wavenumbers. Finally, we demonstrate that thermal effects generate a\nmeasurable and distinct signature (peak-valley structure) in the DSF of Si at\nsmall frequencies.

While various learning-based approaches have been proposed for\ncrystal generation, existing methods seldom consider the space group constraint\nwhich is crucial in describing the geometry of crystals and closely relevant to\nmany desirable properties. However, considering space group constraint is\nchallenging owing to its diverse and nontrivial forms. In this paper, we reduce\nthe space group constraint into an equivalent formulation that is more\ntractable to be handcrafted into the generation process. In particular, we\ntranslate the space group constraint into two parts: the basis constraint of\nthe invariant logarithmic space of the lattice matrix and the Wyckoff position\nconstraint of the fractional coordinates. Upon the derived constraints, we then\npropose DiffCSP++, a novel diffusion model that has enhanced a previous work\nDiffCSP by further taking space group constraint into account. Experiments on\nseveral popular datasets verify the benefit of the involvement of the space\ngroup constraint, and show that our DiffCSP++ achieves promising performance on\ncrystal structure prediction, ab initio crystal generation and controllable\ngeneration with customized space groups.",

    "summary": "Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use\nin the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However,\nLLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and\ninevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and\ndata. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can\ndynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data\non Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput\nworkflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage\nability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science\nconcepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data\n(such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in\ncomputational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining\nuncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of\nresponses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively\nmitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli,\nelectronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data\nsources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and\nrun annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning\nforce fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free\napproach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a\npathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.

    "summary": "In engineering crystal plasticity inelastic mechanisms correspond to\ntensorial zero-energy valleys in the space of macroscopic strains. The flat\nnature of such valleys is in contradiction with the fact that plastic slips,\nmimicking lattice-invariant shears, are inherently discrete. A reconciliation\nhas recently been achieved in the mesoscopic tensorial model (MTM) of crystal\nplasticity, which introduces periodically modulated energy valleys while also\ncapturing in a geometrically exact way the crystallographically-specific\naspects of plastic slips. In this paper, we extend the MTM framework, which in\nits original form had the appearance of a discretized nonlinear elasticity\ntheory, by explicitly introducing the concept of plastic deformation. The\nensuing model contains a novel matrix-valued spin variable, representing the\nquantized plastic distortion, whose rate-independent evolution can be described\nby a discrete (quasi-)automaton. The proposed reformulation of the MTM leads to\na considerable computational speedup associated with the use of a robust and\nefficient hybrid Gauss-Newton--Cauchy energy minimization algorithm. To\nillustrate the effectiveness of the new approach, we present a detailed\ncase-study focusing on the aspects of crystal plasticity that are beyond reach\nfor the classical continuum theory. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that\nthe re-formulated MTM is fully adequate to deal with the intermittency of\nplastic response under quasi-static loading. In particular, our numerical\nexperiments show that the statistics of dislocational avalanches, associated\nwith plastic yield in 2D square crystals, exhibits a power-law tail with a\ncritical exponent matching the value predicted by general theoretical\nconsiderations and also independently observed in discrete-dislocation-dynamics\n(DDD) simulations.",

    "summary": "Crystal dislocation dynamics, especially at high temperatures, represents a\nsubject where experimental phenomenological input is commonly required, and\nparameter-free predictions, starting from quantum methods, have been beyond\nreach. This is especially true for phenomena like stacking faults and\ndislocation cross-slip, which are computationally intractable with methods like\ndensity functional theory, as $\\sim 10^5-10^6$ atoms are required to reliably\nsimulate such systems. Hence, this work extends quantum-mechanical accuracy to\nmesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations and opens unprecedented possibilities\nin material design for extreme mechanical conditions with direct atomistic\ninsight at the deformation mesoscale. To accomplish this, we construct a\nBayesian machine-learned force field (MLFF) from ab initio quantum training\ndata, enabling direct observations of high-temperature and high-stress\ndislocation dynamics in single-crystalline Cu with atomistic resolution. In\ndoing so, a generalizable training protocol is developed for construction of\nMLFFs for dislocation kinetics, with wide-ranging applicability to other single\nelement systems and alloys. The resulting FLARE MLFF provides excellent\npredictions of static bulk elastic properties, stacking fault widths and\nenergies, dynamic evolutions and mobilities of edge and screw dislocations, as\nwell as cross-slip energy barriers for screw dislocations, all of which are\ncompared to available experimental measurements. This work marks the first\nreliable quantitative determination of dislocation mobilities and cross-slip\nbarriers, demonstrating a substantial advancement over previous empirical and\nmachine learned force field models.",

    "summary": "Particle tracking is commonly used to study time-dependent behavior in many\ndifferent types of physical and chemical systems involving constituents that\nspan many length scales, including atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, granular\nparticles, etc. Behaviors of interest studied using particle tracking\ninformation include disorder-order transitions, thermodynamic phase\ntransitions, structural transitions, protein folding, crystallization,\ngelation, swarming, avalanches and fracture. A common challenge in studies of\nthese systems involves change detection. Change point detection discerns when a\ntemporal signal undergoes a change in distribution. These changes can be local\nor global, instantaneous or prolonged, obvious or subtle. Moreover, system-wide\nchanges marking an interesting physical or chemical phenomenon (e.g.\ncrystallization) are often preceded by events (e.g. pre-nucleation clusters)\nthat are localized and can occur anywhere at anytime in the system. For these\nreasons, detecting events in particle trajectories generated by molecular\nsimulation is challenging and typically accomplished via ad hoc solutions\nunique to the behavior and system under study. Consequently, methods for event\ndetection lack generality, and those used in one field are not easily used by\nscientists in other fields. Here we present a new Python-based tool, dupin,\nthat allows for event detection from particle trajectory data irrespective of\nthe system details. dupin works by creating a signal representing the\nsimulation and partitioning the signal based on events (changes within the\ntrajectory). This approach allows for studies where manual annotating of event\nboundaries would require a prohibitive amount of time. Furthermore, dupin can\nserve as a tool in automated and reproducible workflows. We demonstrate the\napplication of dupin using two examples and discuss its applicability to a\nwider class of problems.",

Crystal structures are composed of space-filling polyhedra, which\naffect material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant.\nHowever, most conventional methods of crystal structure prediction use random\nstructure generation methods that do not take space-filling polyhedra into\naccount, contributing to the inefficiency of materials development. In this\nwork, we propose a crystal structure generation method based on discrete\ngeometric analysis of polyhedra information. In our method, the shape and\nconnectivity of a space-filling polyhedron are represented as a dual periodic\ngraph, and the crystal structure is generated by the standard realization of\nthis graph. We demonstrate that this method can correctly generate\nface-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic structures\nfrom dual periodic graphs. This work is a first step toward generating\nundiscovered crystal structures based on the target polyhedra, leading to major\nadvances in materials design in areas including electronics and energy storage.",

    "summary": "The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in\ndriving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and\ncarbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design\nby directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property\nconstraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low\nsuccess rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited\nset of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates\nstable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further\nbe fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property\nconstraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative\nprocess that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,\ncoordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to\nenable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled\ndataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen\nare more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times\ncloser to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully\ngenerates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as\nmechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate\nmulti-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have\nboth high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain\nrisk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of\nMatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a\nuniversal generative model for materials design.",

    "summary": "Generative design marks a significant data-driven advancement in the\nexploration of novel inorganic materials, which entails learning the symmetry\nequivalent to the crystal structure prediction (CSP) task and subsequent\nlearning of their target properties. Generative models have been developed in\nthe last few years that use custom Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion models. While periodicity and global\nEuclidian symmetry in three dimensions through translations, rotations and\nreflections have recently been accounted for, symmetry constraints within\nallowed space groups have not. This is especially important because the final\nstep involves energy relaxation on the generated crystal structures to find the\nrelaxed crystal structure, typically using Density Functional Theory (DFT). To\naddress this explicitly, we introduce a generative design framework (WyCryst),\ncomposed of three pivotal components: 1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic\ncrystal representation, 2) a property-directed VAE model and 3) an automated\nDFT workflow for structure refinement. Our model selectively generates\nmaterials that follow the ground truth of unit cell space group symmetry by\nencoding the Wyckoff representation for each space group. We successfully\nreproduce a variety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and\n221), CsPbI3 (SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both\nground state as well as polymorphic structure predictions. We also generate\nseveral new ternary materials not found in the inorganic materials database\n(Materials Project), which are proved to be stable, retaining their symmetry,\nand we also check their phonon stability, using our automated DFT workflow\nhighlighting the validity of our approach. We believe our symmetry-aware\nWyCryst takes a vital step towards AI-driven inorganic materials discovery.",

Since each altermagnetic material has a\nunique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered\nby an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn\nthe intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by\nfine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the\naltermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we\nsuccessfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals,\nsemiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic\nstructure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics\nreveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly\ndiscovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr\neffect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave\naltermagnetic materials for the first time.

That is, DOS is not solely determined by the crystalline material but\nalso by the energy levels, which has been neglected in previous works. In this\npaper, we propose to integrate heterogeneous information obtained from the\ncrystalline materials and the energies via a multi-modal transformer, thereby\nmodeling the complex relationships between the atoms in the crystalline\nmaterials and various energy levels for DOS prediction.

    "summary": "Two-dimensional materials with Rashba split bands near the Fermi level are\nkey to developing upcoming next-generation spintronics. They enable generating,\ndetecting, and manipulating spin currents without an external magnetic field.\nHere, we propose BiAs as a novel layered semiconductor with large Rashba\nsplitting in bulk and monolayer forms. Using first-principles calculations, we\ndetermined the lowest energy structure of BiAs and its basic electronic\nproperties. Bulk BiAs has a layered crystal structure with two atoms in a\nrhombohedral primitive cell, similar to the parent Bi and As elemental phases.\nIt is a semiconductor with a narrow and indirect band gap. The spin-orbit\ncoupling leads to Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting and characteristic spin\ntexture around the L-point in the Brillouin zone of the hexagonal conventional\nunit cell, with Rashba energy and Rashba coupling constant for valence\n(conduction) band of $E_R$= 137 meV (93 meV) and $\\alpha_R$= 6.05 eV\\AA~(4.6\neV{\\AA}). In monolayer form (i.e., composed of a BiAs bilayer), BiAs has a much\nlarger and direct band gap at $\\Gamma$, with a circular spin texture\ncharacteristic of a pure Rashba effect. The Rashba energy $E_R$= 18 meV and\nRashba coupling constant $\\alpha_R$= 1.67 eV{\\AA} of monolayer BiAs are quite\nlarge compared to other known 2D materials, and these values are shown to\nincrease under tensile biaxial strain.",

    "summary": "Equivariant graph neural networks force fields (EGraFFs) have shown great\npromise in modelling complex interactions in atomic systems by exploiting the\ngraphs' inherent symmetries. Recent works have led to a surge in the\ndevelopment of novel architectures that incorporate equivariance-based\ninductive biases alongside architectural innovations like graph transformers\nand message passing to model atomic interactions. However, thorough evaluations\nof these deploying EGraFFs for the downstream task of real-world atomistic\nsimulations, is lacking. To this end, here we perform a systematic benchmarking\nof 6 EGraFF algorithms (NequIP, Allegro, BOTNet, MACE, Equiformer, TorchMDNet),\nwith the aim of understanding their capabilities and limitations for realistic\natomistic simulations. In addition to our thorough evaluation and analysis on\neight existing datasets based on the benchmarking literature, we release two\nnew benchmark datasets, propose four new metrics, and three challenging tasks.\nThe new datasets and tasks evaluate the performance of EGraFF to\nout-of-distribution data, in terms of different crystal structures,\ntemperatures, and new molecules. Interestingly, evaluation of the EGraFF models\nbased on dynamic simulations reveals that having a lower error on energy or\nforce does not guarantee stable or reliable simulation or faithful replication\nof the atomic structures. Moreover, we find that no model clearly outperforms\nother models on all datasets and tasks. Importantly, we show that the\nperformance of all the models on out-of-distribution datasets is unreliable,\npointing to the need for the development of a foundation model for force fields\nthat can be used in real-world simulations. In summary, this work establishes a\nrigorous framework for evaluating machine learning force fields in the context\nof atomic simulations and points to open research challenges within this\ndomain.",

Chemical formulas are obligated to conform to a set of\nexacting criteria such as charge neutrality, balanced electronegativity,\nsynthesizability, and mechanical stability. In response to this formidable\ntask, we introduce a deep learning-based generative model for material\ncomposition and structure design by learning and exploiting explicit and\nimplicit chemical knowledge. Our pipeline first uses deep diffusion language\nmodels as the generator of compositions and then applies a template-based\ncrystal structure prediction algorithm to predict their corresponding\nstructures, which is then followed by structure relaxation using a universal\ngraph neural network-based potential. The density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations of the formation energies and energy-above-the-hull analysis are\nused to validate new structures generated through our pipeline. Based on the\nDFT calculation results, six new materials, including Ti2HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,\nTaReO4, HfTiO2, and HfMnO2, with formation energy less than zero have been\nfound. Remarkably, among these, four materials, namely Ti2$HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,\nand TaReO4, exhibit an e-above-hull energy of less than 0.3 eV.

We\ndemonstrate this framework in the case of hydrogen interstitials in\nface-centered cubic crystals, showing that their differential electron charge\ndensity profiles capture crystal properties and defect-crystal interaction\nproperties. Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) of defect-induced differential\ncharge density perturbations highlight the resulting screening effect, and,\ntogether with hydrogen Bader charges, strongly correlate to a large set of\natomic properties of the metal species forming the bulk crystal. We observe the\nspontaneous emergence of classes of charge responses while coarse-graining over\ncrystal compositions. Nudge-Elastic-Band calculations show that RDFs and charge\nfeatures also connect to hydrogen migration energy barriers between\ninterstitial sites. Unsupervised machine-learning on RDFs supports\nclassification, unveiling compositional and configurational non-localities in\nthe similarities of the perturbed densities.

While the quasi-1D chains in these materials share general\nsimilarities, such as the motifs made up of MoO6 octahedrons, they exhibit vast\ncomplexity and remarkable tunability. We disassemble the 1D chains in\nmolybdenum oxides with different dimensions and construct effective models to\nexcellently fit their low-energy electronic structures obtained by ab initio\ncalculations. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of such chains on other\nphysical properties of the materials and the practical significance of the\neffective models.

The mechanical\nbehavior of the material has been modeled with the elasto-viscoplastic single\ncrystal constitutive model developed by \\citet{marin2006}. The polycrystalline\nmicrostructure of the ring has been generated using random Voronoi seeds. Both\n$5000$ grain and $15000$ grain aggregates have been investigated, and for each\npolycrystalline aggregate three different spatial distributions of grains have\nbeen considered. The calculations have been performed within a wide range of\nstrain rates varying from $1.66 \\cdot 10^4 ~ \\text{s}^{-1}$ to $3.33 \\cdot 10^5\n~ \\text{s}^{-1}$, and the rings have been modeled with four different initial\ntextures: isotropic texture, $\\left\\langle 001\\right\\rangle\\parallel\\Theta$\nGoss texture, $\\left\\langle 001\\right\\rangle\\parallel$ R Goss texture and\n$\\left\\langle 111\\right\\rangle\\parallel$ Z fiber texture. The finite element\nresults show that: (i) the spatial distribution of grains affects the location\nof the necks, (ii) the decrease of the grain size delays the formation of the\nnecking pattern and increases the number of necks, (iii) the initial texture\naffects the number of necks, the location of the necks, and the necking time,\n(iv) the development of the necks is accompanied by a local increase of the\nslip activity. This work provides new insights into the effect of\ncrystallographic microstructure on dynamic plastic localization and guidelines\nto tailor the initial texture in order to delay dynamic necking formation and,\nthus, to improve the energy absorption capacity of ductile metallic materials\nat high strain rates.",

Previously, in simulations of tubular\ncrystals as elastic networks, we found that dislocations in nontrivial patterns\ncan co-stabilize with kinks in the tube shape, producing mechanical\nmultistability. Here, we extend that work with detailed Langevin dynamics\nsimulations, in order to explore defect dynamics efficiently and without the\nconstraints imposed by elastic network models. Along with the predicted\nmultistability of dislocation glide, we find a variety of irreversible defect\ntransformations, including vacancy formation, particle extrusions, and\n\"reactions\" that reorient dislocation pairs. Moreover, we report spontaneous\nsequences of several such defect transformations, which are unique to tubular\ncrystals. We demonstrate a simple method for controlling these sequences\nthrough a time-varying external force.",

    "summary": "Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly popular for predicting\nmaterial properties to accelerate materials discovery. Because material\nproperties are strongly affected by its crystal structure, a key issue is\nconverting the crystal structure into the features for input to the ML model.\nCurrently, the most common method is to convert the crystal structure into a\ngraph and predicting its properties using a graph neural network (GNN). Some\nGNN models, such as crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) and\natomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN), have achieved highly accurate\npredictions of material properties. Despite these successes, using a graph to\nrepresent a crystal structure has the notable limitation of losing the crystal\nstructure's three-dimensional (3D) information. In this work, we propose\nDeepCrysTet, a novel deep learning approach for predicting material properties,\nwhich uses crystal structures represented as a 3D tetrahedral mesh generated by\nDelaunay tetrahedralization. DeepCrysTet provides a useful framework that\nincludes a 3D mesh generation method, mesh-based feature design, and neural\nnetwork design. The experimental results using the Materials Project dataset\nshow that DeepCrysTet significantly outperforms existing GNN models in\nclassifying crystal structures and achieves state-of-the-art performance in\npredicting elastic properties.",

    "summary": "In the last decades, material discovery has been a very active research field\ndriven by the need to find new materials for many different applications. This\nhas also included materials with heavy elements, beyond the stable isotopes of\nlead, as most actinides exhibit unique properties that make them useful in\nvarious applications. Furthermore, new heavy elements beyond actinides,\ncollectively referred to as super-heavy elements (SHEs), have been synthesized,\nfilling previously empty space of Mendeleev periodic table. Their chemical\nbonding behavior, of academic interest at present, would also benefit of\nstate-of-the-art modeling approaches. In particular, in order to perform\nfirst-principles calculations with planewave basis sets, one needs\ncorresponding pseudopotentials. In this work, we present a series of scalar-\nand fully-relativistic optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials\n(ONCVPs) for thirty-four actinides and super-heavy elements, for three\ndifferent exchange-correlation functionals (PBE, PBEsol and LDA). The\nscalar-relativistic version of these ONCVPs is tested by comparing equations of\nstates for crystals, obtained with \\textsc{abinit} 9.6, with those obtained by\nall-electron zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) calculations, without\nspin-orbit coupling, performed with the Amsterdam Modeling Suite \\textsc{band}\ncode. $\\Delta$-Gauge and $\\Delta_1$-Gauge indicators are used to validate these\npseudopotentials. This work is a contribution to the PseudoDojo project, in\nwhich pseudopotentials for the whole periodic table are developed and\nsystematically tested. The pseudopotential files are available on the\nPseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org in psp8 and UPF2 formats, both\nsuitable for \\textsc{abinit}, the latter being also suitable for Quantum\nESPRESSO.",

To identify the best-performing ML methodologies for\nmaterials discovery, we benchmarked various approaches, including random\nforests, graph neural networks (GNNs), one-shot predictors, iterative Bayesian\noptimizers, and universal interatomic potentials (UIP).

We also identify a misalignment\nbetween regression metrics and task-relevant classification metrics. Accurate\nregressors can yield high false-positive rates near the decision boundary at 0\neV/atom above the convex hull. Our results demonstrate UIPs' ability to\noptimize computational budget allocation for expanding materials databases.\nHowever, their limitations remain underexplored in traditional benchmarks.

Our side-by-side comparison displays a remarkable suppression of the\nplastic zone size in equiatomic W--V RSS, but not in equiatomic W--Mo RSS\nalloys, displaying a clear prediction for optimal hardening response equiatomic\nW--V RSS alloys.

We show that the positions of\nWeyl nodes and Fermi arcs can be accurately controlled by changing light\nintensity. Moreover, we employ a low-energy eective k p model to understand\nlight-controllable Weyl physics. The results indicate that the symmetry of\nlight-irradiated fco-C6 can be selectively preserved, which guarantees that the\nlight-manipulated Weyl nodes can only move in the highsymmetry plane in\nmomentum space. Our work not only demonstrates the ecacy of employing periodic\ndriving light elds as an ecient approach to manipulate Weyl physics, but also\npaves a reliable pathway for designing accessible topological states under\nlight irradiation.",

    "summary": "The chemical exfoliation of non-van der Waals (vdW) materials to ultrathin\nnanosheets remains a formidable challenge. This difficulty arises from the\nstrong preference of these materials to engage in three-dimensional chemical\nbonding, resulting in uncontrolled atomic migration into the vdW gaps during\ncation deintercalation from the bulk structure, ultimately leading to\nunpredictable structural disorder. We propose a generic framework using neural\nnetwork potentials (NNPs) to accurately model the widespread nonstoichiometric\nenvironments resulting from disordered atomic migrations during exfoliation of\nnon-vdW materials. We apply our framework to investigate the crystal structures\nand phase transformations occurring during the exfoliation of non-vdW\nnonstoichiometric Cr$_{(1-x)}$S systems, a compelling material category with\nsubstantial potential for two-dimensional (2D) magnetic applications. The\nefficacy of the NNP outperforms the conventional cluster expansion, exhibiting\nsuperior accuracy and transferability to unexplored crystal structures and\ncompositions. By employing the NNP in simulated annealing optimizations, we\npredict low-energy Cr$_{(1-x)}$S structures anticipated to result from\nexperimental synthesis. A notable structural transition is discerned at the\nCr$_{0.5}$S composition, with half of the Cr atoms preferentially migrating to\nvdW gaps. This aligns with experimental observations in the chemical\nexfoliation of 2D CrS$_2$, and emphasizes the vital role of excess Cr atoms\nbeyond the Cr/S = $1/2$ composition ratio in stabilizing vdW gaps.\nAdditionally, we utilize the NNP in a vacancy diffusion Monte Carlo simulation\nto illustrate the impact of lateral compressive strains in catalyzing the\nformation of vdW gaps within non-vdW CrS$_2$ slabs. This provides a direct\npathway for more facile exfoliation of ultrathin nanosheets from non-vdW\nmaterials through strain engineering.",

    "summary": "The crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) is a machine learning\nmodel that leverages score matching to generate realistic crystal structures\nthat preserve crystal symmetry. In this study, we leverage novel diffusion\nprobabilistic (DP) models to denoise atomic coordinates rather than adopting\nthe standard score matching approach in CDVAE. Our proposed DP-CDVAE model can\nreconstruct and generate crystal structures whose qualities are statistically\ncomparable to those of the original CDVAE. Furthermore, notably, when comparing\nthe carbon structures generated by the DP-CDVAE model with relaxed structures\nobtained from density functional theory calculations, we find that the DP-CDVAE\ngenerated structures are remarkably closer to their respective ground states.\nThe energy differences between these structures and the true ground states are,\non average, 68.1 meV/atom lower than those generated by the original CDVAE.\nThis significant improvement in the energy accuracy highlights the\neffectiveness of the DP-CDVAE model in generating crystal structures that\nbetter represent their ground-state configurations.",

    "summary": "We present a high-throughput, end-to-end pipeline for organic crystal\nstructure prediction (CSP) -- the problem of identifying the stable crystal\nstructures that will form from a given molecule based only on its molecular\ncomposition. Our tool uses Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) to allow for\nefficient screening and structural relaxations of generated crystal candidates.\nOur pipeline consists of two distinct stages -- random search, whereby crystal\ncandidates are randomly generated and screened, and optimization, where a\ngenetic algorithm (GA) optimizes this screened population. We assess the\nperformance of each stage of our pipeline on 21 molecules taken from the\nCambridge Crystallographic Data Centre's CSP blind tests. We show that random\nsearch alone yields matches for $\\approx 50\\%$ of targets. We then validate the\npotential of our full pipeline, making use of the GA to optimize the Root\nMean-Squared Deviation (RMSD) between crystal candidates and the experimentally\nderived structure. With this approach, we are able to find matches for\n$\\approx80\\%$ of candidates with 10-100 times smaller initial population sizes\nthan when using random search. Lastly, we run our full pipeline with an ANI\nmodel that is trained on a small dataset of molecules extracted from crystal\nstructures in the Cambridge Structural Database, generating $\\approx 60\\%$ of\ntargets. By leveraging ML models trained to predict energies at the DFT level,\nour pipeline has the potential to approach the accuracy of \\emph{ab initio}\nmethods and the efficiency of empirical force-fields.",

    "summary": "Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) is crucial in various scientific\ndisciplines. While CSP can be addressed by employing currently-prevailing\ngenerative models (e.g. diffusion models), this task encounters unique\nchallenges owing to the symmetric geometry of crystal structures -- the\ninvariance of translation, rotation, and periodicity. To incorporate the above\nsymmetries, this paper proposes DiffCSP, a novel diffusion model to learn the\nstructure distribution from stable crystals. To be specific, DiffCSP jointly\ngenerates the lattice and atom coordinates for each crystal by employing a\nperiodic-E(3)-equivariant denoising model, to better model the crystal\ngeometry. Notably, different from related equivariant generative approaches,\nDiffCSP leverages fractional coordinates other than Cartesian coordinates to\nrepresent crystals, remarkably promoting the diffusion and the generation\nprocess of atom positions. Extensive experiments verify that our DiffCSP\nsignificantly outperforms existing CSP methods, with a much lower computation\ncost in contrast to DFT-based methods. Moreover, the superiority of DiffCSP is\nalso observed when it is extended for ab initio crystal generation.",

We highlight here the anomalous abundance of inorganic\ncompounds whose primitive unit cell contains a number of atoms that is a\nmultiple of four. This occurrence - named here the 'rule of four' - has to our\nknowledge not previously been reported or studied. Here, we first highlight the\nrule's existence, especially notable when restricting oneself to experimentally\nknown compounds, and explore its possible relationship with established\ndescriptors of crystal structures, from symmetries to energies. We then\ninvestigate this relative abundance by looking at structural descriptors, both\nof global (packing configurations) and local (the smooth overlap of atomic\npositions) nature. Contrary to intuition, the overabundance does not correlate\nwith low-energy or high-symmetry structures; in fact, structures which obey the\n'rule of four' are characterized by low symmetries and loosely packed\narrangements maximizing the free volume. We are able to correlate this\nabundance with local structural symmetries, and visualize the results using a\nhybrid supervised-unsupervised machine learning method.",

    "summary": "In this manuscript, after discussing in detail the internals of our recently\ndeveloped method, the dynamical projective operatorial approach (DPOA), we\nprovide the framework to apply this method to pumped semiconductor lattice\nsystems and, in particular, to study and analyze their electronic excitations\nand TR-ARPES signal. The expressions for relevant out-of-equilibrium Green's\nfunctions and TR-ARPES signal are given within the DPOA framework and, defining\na retarded TR-ARPES signal, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an\nout-of-equilibrium version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We clarify\nhow single- and multi-photon resonances, rigid shifts, band dressings, and\ndifferent types of sidebands emerge in the TR-ARPES signal. We also propose\nprotocols for evaluating the strength of single- and multi-photon resonances\nand for assigning the residual excited electronic population at each crystal\nmomentum and band to a specific excitation process. Hamiltonians, where intra-\nand inter-band transitions are selectively inhibited, are defined and used to\nanalyze the effects on the TR-ARPES signal and the residual electronic excited\npopulation. Three relevant cases of light-matter coupling are examined within\nthe dipole gauge: only a local dipole, only the Peierls substitution in the\nhopping term, and both terms at once. The transient and residual pump effects\nare studied in detail, including the consequences of the lattice symmetries at\ndifferent crystal momenta on the TR-ARPES signal. A detailed study of the\ndependence of the TR-ARPES signal on the probe-pulse characteristics is also\nreported. To provide a guideline for understanding the complex effects and\ninterplays and the variety of possible physical phenomena without being limited\nby the characteristics of a single particular real material, we have chosen to\nstudy a prototypical pumped two-band semiconductor lattice system.",

    "summary": "Machine Learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate\nprediction of different crystalline properties. Exiting state-of-the-art models\nrely on a single modality of crystal data i.e. crystal graph structure, where\nthey construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D\nspace and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode\nlocal chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture\nimportant global periodic structural information like space group number,\ncrystal symmetry, rotational information, etc, which influence different\ncrystal properties. In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials\nto model global structural information into graph structure and learn a more\nrobust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we\nfirst curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing\ndescriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple\nmulti-modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation\ntogether to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline\nmaterials. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across\nten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe that\nfusing the textual representation with crystal graph structure provides\nconsistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own\nvanilla versions. We have shared the textual dataset, that we have curated for\nboth the benchmark material databases, with the community for future use.",

Recently, the problem of\ngenerating crystal materials has received increasing attention, however, it\nremains unclear to what extent, or in what way, we can develop generative\nmodels that consider both the periodicity and equivalence geometric of crystal\nstructures. To alleviate this issue, we propose two unified models that act at\nthe same time on crystal lattice and atomic positions using periodic\nequivariant architectures. Our models are capable to learn any arbitrary\ncrystal lattice deformation by lowering the total energy to reach thermodynamic\nstability.

However,\ntraditional crystal structure prediction methods, which rely solely on\nenergetic factors to determine a structure's fitness, are not suitable for\npredicting the vast number of potentially synthesizable phases that represent a\nlocal minimum corresponding to a state in thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we\npresent a new approach for the prediction of metastable phases with specific\nstructural features, and interface this method with the XtalOpt evolutionary\nalgorithm. Our method relies on structural features that include the local\ncrystalline order (e.g., the coordination number or chemical environment), and\nsymmetry (e.g., Bravais lattice and space group) to filter the parent pool of\nan evolutionary crystal structure search. The effectiveness of this approach is\nbenchmarked on three known metastable systems: XeN$_8$, with a two-dimensional\npolymeric nitrogen sublattice, brookite TiO$_2$, and a high pressure BaH$_4$\nphase that was recently characterized. Additionally, a newly predicted\nmetastable melaminate salt, $P$-1 WC$_{3}$N$_{6}$, was found to possess an\nenergy that is lower than two phases proposed in a recent computational study.\nThe method presented here could help in identifying the structures of compounds\nthat have already been synthesized, and developing new synthesis targets with\ndesired properties.",

Ideally, an emitter should have a compatible\nwavelength for efficient coupling to other components in a quantum network. It\nis therefore essential to understand fluorescent defects that lead to specific\nemitters. In this work, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to\ndemonstrate the calculation of the complete optical fingerprints of quantum\nemitters in the two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride. These\nemitters are of great interest, yet many of them are still to be identified.\nOur results suggest that instead of comparing a single optical property, such\nas the commonly used zero-phonon line energy, multiple properties should be\nused when comparing theoretical simulations to the experiment. This way, the\nentire electronic structure can be predicted and quantum emitters can be\ndesigned and tailored. Moreover, we apply this approach to predict the\nsuitability for using the emitters in specific quantum applications,\ndemonstrating through the examples of the Al$_{\\text{N}}$ and\nP$_{\\text{N}}$V$_{\\text{B}}$ defects. We therefore combine and apply DFT\ncalculations to identify quantum emitters in solid-state crystals with a lower\nrisk of misassignments as well as a way to design and tailor optical quantum\nsystems. This consequently serves as a recipe for classification and the\ngeneration of universal solid-state quantum emitter systems in future hybrid\nquantum networks.",

Only in 2016,\nhowever, their precision (i.e., to which extent properties computed with\ndifferent codes agree among each other) was systematically assessed on\nelemental crystals: a first crucial step to evaluate the reliability of such\ncomputations. We discuss here general recommendations for verification studies\naiming at further testing precision and transferability of\ndensity-functional-theory computational approaches and codes. We illustrate\nsuch recommendations using a greatly expanded protocol covering the whole\nperiodic table from Z=1 to 96 and characterizing 10 prototypical cubic\ncompounds for each element: 4 unaries and 6 oxides, spanning a wide range of\ncoordination numbers and oxidation states. The primary outcome is a reference\ndataset of 960 equations of state cross-checked between two all-electron codes,\nthen used to verify and improve nine pseudopotential-based approaches. Such\neffort is facilitated by deploying AiiDA common workflows that perform\nautomatic input parameter selection, provide identical input/output interfaces\nacross codes, and ensure full reproducibility. Finally, we discuss the extent\nto which the current results for total energies can be reused for different\ngoals (e.g., obtaining formation energies).",

This shotgun method (ShotgunCSP) has two key\ntechnical components: transfer learning for accurate energy prediction of\npre-relaxed crystalline states, and two generative models based on element\nsubstitution and symmetry-restricted structure generation to produce promising\nand diverse crystal structures. First-principles calculations were performed\nonly to generate the training samples and to refine a few selected pre-relaxed\ncrystal structures.

    "summary": "Efficient generation and manipulation of spin signals in a given material\nwithout invoking external magnetism remain one of the challenges in\nspintronics. The spin Hall effect (SHE) and Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) are\nwell-known mechanisms to electrically generate spin accumulation in materials\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), but the exact role of the strength and\ntype of SOC, especially in crystals with low symmetry, has yet to be explained.\nIn this study, we investigate REE in two different families of non-magnetic\nchiral materials, elemental semiconductors (Te and Se) and semimetallic\ndisilicides (TaSi$_2$ and NbSi$_2$), using an approach based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT). By analyzing spin textures across the full Brillouin\nzones and comparing them with REE magnitudes calculated as a function of\nchemical potential, we link specific features in the electronic structure with\nthe efficiency of the induced spin accumulation. Our findings show that\nmagnitudes of REE can be increased by: (i) the presence of purely radial\n(Weyl-type) spin texture manifesting as the parallel spin-momentum locking,\n(ii) high spin polarization of bands along one specific crystallographic\ndirection, (iii) low band velocities. By comparing materials possessing the\nsame crystal structures, but different strengths of SOC, we conclude that\nlarger SOC may indirectly contribute to the enhancement of REE. It yields\ngreater spin-splitting of bands along specific crystallographic directions,\nwhich prevents canceling the contributions from the oppositely spin-polarized\nbands over wider energy regions and helps maintain larger REE magnitudes. We\nbelieve that these results will be useful for designing spintronics devices and\nmay aid further computational studies searching for efficient REE in materials\nwith different symmetries and SOC strengths.",

To effectively make use of Deep Learning\nmethods to model these materials, we need to utilize the symmetries present in\nthe crystals, which are defined by their space group. Existing methods for\ncrystal property prediction either have symmetry constraints that are too\nrestrictive or only incorporate symmetries between unit cells. In addition,\nthese models do not explicitly model the porous structure of the crystal. In\nthis paper, we develop a model which incorporates the symmetries of the unit\ncell of a crystal in its architecture and explicitly models the porous\nstructure. We evaluate our model by predicting the heat of adsorption of CO$_2$\nfor different configurations of the mordenite zeolite. Our results confirm that\nour method performs better than existing methods for crystal property\nprediction and that the inclusion of pores results in a more efficient model.",

Here we employ a density functional theory (DFT) workflow to\ncalculate interlayer binding energies of 8451 homobilayers created by stacking\n1052 different monolayers in various configurations. Analysis of the stacking\norders in 247 experimentally known van der Waals crystals is used to validate\nthe workflow and determine the criteria for realizable bilayers. For the 2586\nmost stable bilayer systems, we calculate a range of electronic, magnetic, and\nvibrational properties, and explore general trends and anomalies. We identify\nan abundance of bistable bilayers with stacking order-dependent magnetic or\nelectrical polarisation states making them candidates for slidetronics\napplications.",

    "summary": "Machine learning techniques have successfully been used to extract structural\ninformation such as the crystal space group from powder X-ray diffractograms.\nHowever, training directly on simulated diffractograms from databases such as\nthe ICSD is challenging due to its limited size, class-inhomogeneity, and bias\ntoward certain structure types. We propose an alternative approach of\ngenerating synthetic crystals with random coordinates by using the symmetry\noperations of each space group. Based on this approach, we demonstrate online\ntraining of deep ResNet-like models on up to a few million unique on-the-fly\ngenerated synthetic diffractograms per hour. For our chosen task of space group\nclassification, we achieved a test accuracy of 79.9% on unseen ICSD structure\ntypes from most space groups. This surpasses the 56.1% accuracy of the current\nstate-of-the-art approach of training on ICSD crystals directly. Our results\ndemonstrate that synthetically generated crystals can be used to extract\nstructural information from ICSD powder diffractograms, which makes it possible\nto apply very large state-of-the-art machine learning models in the area of\npowder X-ray diffraction. We further show first steps toward applying our\nmethodology to experimental data, where automated XRD data analysis is crucial,\nespecially in high-throughput settings.

Obtaining MLWFs\nthat describe a target manifold accurately and with the most compact\nrepresentation often requires chemical intuition and trial and error, a\nchallenging step even for experienced researchers and a roadblock for automated\nhigh-throughput calculations. Here, we present a powerful approach that\nautomatically provides MLWFs spanning the occupied bands and their natural\ncomplement for the empty states, resulting in Wannier Hamiltonian models that\nprovide a tight-binding picture of optimized atomic orbitals in crystals. Key\nto the success of the algorithm is the introduction of a projectability measure\nfor each Bloch state onto atomic orbitals (here, chosen from the\npseudopotential projectors) that determines if that state should be kept\nidentically, discarded, or mixed into a disentangling algorithm. We showcase\nthe accuracy of our method by comparing a reference test set of 200 materials\nagainst the selected-columns-of-the-density-matrix algorithm, and its\nreliability by constructing Wannier Hamiltonians for 21737 materials from the\nMaterials Cloud.",

    "summary": "The phase-field crystal (PFC) model describes crystal lattices at diffusive\ntimescales. Its amplitude expansion (APFC) can be applied to the investigation\nof relatively large systems under some approximations. However, crystal\nsymmetries accessible within the APFC model are limited to basic ones, namely\ntriangular and square in two dimensions, and body-centered cubic and\nface-centered cubic in three dimensions. In this work, we propose a general,\namplitudes-based description of virtually any lattice symmetry. To fully\nexploit the advantages of this model, featuring slowly varying quantities in\nbulk and localized significant variations at dislocations and interfaces, we\nconsider formulations suitable for real-space numerical methods supporting\nadaptive spatial discretization. We explore approaches originally proposed for\nthe PFC model which allow for symmetries beyond basic ones through extended\nparametrizations. Moreover, we tackle the modeling of non-Bravais lattices by\nintroducing an amplitude expansion for lattices with a basis and further\ngeneralizations. We study and discuss the stability of selected, prototypical\nlattice symmetries. As pivotal examples, we show that the proposed approach\nallows for a coarse-grained description of the kagome lattice, exotic square\narrangements, and the diamond lattice, as bulk crystals and, importantly,\nhosting dislocations.",

    "summary": "Studies of structure-property relationships in spintronics are essential for\nthe design of materials that can fill specific roles in devices. For example,\nmaterials with low symmetry allow unconventional configurations of\ncharge-to-spin conversion which can be used to generate efficient spin-orbit\ntorques. Here, we explore the relationship between crystal symmetry and\ngeometry of the Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) that causes spin accumulation in\nresponse to an applied electric current. Based on a symmetry analysis performed\nfor 230 crystallographic space groups, we identify classes of materials that\ncan host conventional or collinear REE. Although transverse spin accumulation\nis commonly associated with the so-called 'Rashba materials', we show that the\npresence of specific spin texture does not easily translate to the\nconfiguration of REE. More specifically, bulk crystals may simultaneously host\ndifferent types of spin-orbit fields, depending on the crystallographic point\ngroup and the symmetry of the specific $k$-vector, which, averaged over the\nBrillouin zone, determine the direction and magnitude of the induced spin\naccumulation. To explore the connection between crystal symmetry, spin texture,\nand the magnitude of REE, we perform first-principles calculations for\nrepresentative materials with different symmetries. We believe that our results\nwill be helpful for further computational and experimental studies, as well as\nthe design of spintronics devices.",

    "summary": "Natural optical activity is the paradigmatic example of an effect originating\nin the weak spatial inhomogeneity of the electromagnetic field on the atomic\nscale. In molecules, such effects are well described by the multipole theory of\nelectromagnetism, where the coupling to light is treated semiclassically beyond\nthe electric-dipole approximation. That theory has two shortcomings: it is\nlimited to bounded systems, and its building blocks - the multipole transition\nmoments - are origin dependent. In this work, we recast the multipole theory in\na translationally-invariant form that remains valid for crystals. Working in\nthe independent-particle approximation, we introduce \"intrinsic\" multipole\ntransition moments that are origin independent and transform covariantly under\ngauge transformations of the Bloch eigenstates. Electric-dipole transitions are\ngiven by the interband Berry connection, while magnetic-dipole and\nelectric-quadrupole transitions are described by matrix generalizations of the\nintrinsic magnetic moment and quantum metric. In addition to multipole-like\nterms, the response of crystals at first order in the wavevector of light\ncontains band-dispersion terms that have no counterpart in molecular theories.\nThe full response is broken down into magnetoelectric and quadrupolar parts,\nwhich can be isolated in the static limit where electric and magnetic fields\nbecome decoupled. The rotatory-strength sum rule for crystals is found to be\nequivalent to the topological constraint for a vanishing chiral magnetic effect\nin equilibrium, and the formalism is validated by numerical tight-binding\ncalculations.",

We examine the\nstress-induced changes in electronic structure for the thermodynamically stable\n1T polytype of selected MX2 compounds (M=Hf, Zr, Sn; X=S, Se), using the\ndensity functional theory. We demonstrate that considered 1T-MX2 materials are\nsemiconducting with indirect character of the band gap, irrespective to the\nemployed pressure as predicted using modified Becke-Johnson potential. We\ndetermine energies of direct interband transitions between bands extrema and in\nband-nesting regions close to Fermi level. Generally, the studied transitions\nare optically active, exhibiting in-plane polarization of light. Finally, we\nquantify their energy trends under external hydrostatic, uniaxial, and biaxial\nstresses by determining the linear pressure coefficients. Generally, negative\npressure coefficients are obtained implying the narrowing of the band gap. The\nsemiconducting-to-metal transition are predicted under hydrostatic pressure. We\ndiscuss these trends in terms of orbital composition of involved electronic\nbands.

    "summary": "The theory of bulk orbital magnetization has been formulated both in\nreciprocal space based on Berry curvature and related quantities, and in real\nspace in terms of the spatial average of a quantum mechanical local marker.\nHere we consider a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic material having a\nvanishing bulk but a nonzero surface orbital magnetization. We ask whether the\nsurface-normal component of the surface magnetization is well defined, and if\nso, how to compute it. As the physical observable corresponding to this\nquantity, we identify the macroscopic current running along a hinge shared by\ntwo facets. However, the hinge current only constrains the difference of the\nsurface magnetizations on the adjoined facets, leaving a potential ambiguity.\nBy performing a symmetry analysis, we find that only crystals exhibiting a\npseudoscalar symmetry admit well-defined magnetizations at their surfaces at\nthe classical level. We then explore the possibility of computing surface\nmagnetization via a coarse-graining procedure applied to a quantum local\nmarker. We show that multiple expressions for the local marker exist, and apply\nconstraints to filter out potentially meaningful candidates. Using several\ntight-binding models as our theoretical test bed and several potential markers,\nwe compute surface magnetizations for slab geometries and compare their\npredictions with explicit calculations of the macroscopic hinge currents of rod\ngeometries. We find that only a particular form of the marker consistently\npredicts the correct hinge currents.",

Here, we outline a strategy\nexploiting Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the multidimensional\nspace of microstructures, defined here by the size distribution of precipitates\n(fixed impurities or inclusions acting as obstacles for dislocation motion)\nwithin a simple two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model. The aim is\nto design a microstructure optimizing a given mechanical property, e.g.,\nmaximizing the expected value of shear stress for a given strain. The problem\nof finding the optimal discretized shape for a distribution involves a norm\nconstraint, and we find that sampling the space of possible solutions should be\ndone in a specific way in order to avoid convergence problems. To this end, we\npropose a general mathematical approach that can be used to generate trial\nsolutions uniformly at random while enforcing an Euclidean norm constraint.\nBoth equality and inequality constraints are considered. A simple technique can\nthen be used to convert between Euclidean and other Lebesgue $p$-norm (the\n1-norm in particular) constrained representations. Considering different\ndislocation-precipitate interaction potentials, we demonstrate the convergence\nof the algorithm to the optimal solution and discuss its possible extensions to\nthe more complex and realistic case of three-dimensional dislocation systems\nwhere also the optimization of precipitate shapes could be considered.",

    "summary": "Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful computational method used to\nobtain physical and chemical properties of materials. In the materials\ndiscovery framework, it is often necessary to virtually screen a large and\nhigh-dimensional chemical space to find materials with desired properties.\nHowever, grid searching a large chemical space with DFT is inefficient due to\nits high computational cost. We propose an approach utilizing Bayesian\noptimization (BO) with an artificial neural network kernel to enable smart\nsearch. This method leverages the BO algorithm, where the neural network,\ntrained on a limited number of DFT results, determines the most promising\nregions of the chemical space to explore in subsequent iterations. This\napproach aims to discover materials with target properties while minimizing the\nnumber of DFT calculations required. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nmethod, we investigated 63 doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with sizes\nranging from 1 to 2 nm to find the structure with the highest light absorbance.\nUsing time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) only 12 times, we achieved a significant\nreduction in computational cost, approximately 20% of what would be required\nfor a full grid search, by employing the BO algorithm with a neural network\nkernel. Considering that TDDFT calculations for a single GQD require about half\na day of wall time on high-performance computing nodes, this reduction is\nsubstantial. Our approach can be generalized to the discovery of new drugs,\nchemicals, crystals, and alloys with high-dimensional and large chemical\nspaces, offering a scalable solution for various applications in materials\nscience.",

    "summary": "Data-driven machine learning methods have the potential to dramatically\naccelerate the rate of materials design over conventional human-guided\napproaches. These methods would help identify or, in the case of generative\nmodels, even create novel crystal structures of materials with a set of\nspecified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the\nlaboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in\ndeveloping suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the\nmachine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations\nused in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations\nthat are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while\nremaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing\nchallenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking\nexisting non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and\ndeveloping an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through\ngradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be\ncoupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials\nwithin the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian\nspace. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach\nusing atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional\nvariational autoencoders as the generative model. We are able to successfully\ngenerate novel and valid atomic structures of sub-nanometer Pt nanoparticles as\na proof of concept. Furthermore, this method can be readily extended to any\nsuitable structural representation, thereby providing a powerful, generalizable\nframework towards structure-based generation.",

We systematically generate\ncrystal structures utilizing the distortion modes and compute their energies\nwith single-point DFT calculations. We then train a ML model to identify\nlow-energy configurations on the material's high-dimensional potential energy\nsurface. Here, we use BiFeO3 as a case study and explore its phase space by\ntuning the amplitudes of linear combinations of a finite set of distinct\ndistortion modes. Our procedure is validated by rediscovering several known\nmetastable phases of BiFeO3 with complex crystal structures, and its efficiency\nis proved by identifying 21 new low-energy polymorphs. This approach proposes a\nnew avenue toward accelerating the prediction of low-energy polymorphs in\nsolid-state materials.",

For applications, colloidal diamond is a photonic\ncrystal which can open new possibilities of manipulating light for information\nprocessing. From a fundamental point of view, its unique symmetry exacerbates a\nseries of problems that are commonly faced during the self-assembly of target\nstructures, such as the presence of kinetic traps and the formation of\ncrystalline defects and alternative structures (polymorphs). Here we\ndemonstrate that all these problems can be systematically addressed via\nSAT-assembly, a design framework that converts self-assembly into a\nsatisfiability problem. Contrary to previous solutions (requiring four or more\ncomponents), we prove that the assembly of the CD crystal only requires a\nbinary mixture.

The disparate behaviour is traced to\nwhether the grid points depend on the coordinate with respect to which the\nderivative of energy is taken.

The anisotropy of the exciton delocalization is\ndetermined by the local anisotropy of the structure, whereas the exciton\nextends orthogonally to the chains formed by the crystal structure. Moreover,\nwe show that the bright exciton goes together with a dark exciton of even\nlarger binding energy and more pronounced anisotropy. These findings are\nobtained by combining first principles many-body perturbation theory\ncalculations, ellipsometry experiments, and tight binding modelling, leading to\nvery good agreement and a consistent picture.

    "summary": "Self-supervised neural language models have recently achieved unprecedented\nsuccess, from natural language processing to learning the languages of\nbiological sequences and organic molecules. These models have demonstrated\nsuperior performance in the generation, structure classification, and\nfunctional predictions for proteins and molecules with learned representations.\nHowever, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed\nfor generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to\ninterpret their design logic. Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a\nneural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and\ntinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank\nfilling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique\nadvantages in learning the \"materials grammars\" together with high-quality\ngeneration, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically\nvalid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\\% charge neutrality and\n84.8\\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher\ncompared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation\nprocess of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned\nmaterials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the\nTCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to\ndiscover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations. Our work\nthus brings the unsupervised transformer language models based generative\nartificial intelligence to inorganic materials.

We\ndemonstrate that these two electronic phenomena are readily reproduced and\nunderstood in density functional theory, but that neither perturbs the trend in\nc/a ratio against pressure. Hence the observed anomalies in c/a must have\nanother cause. Osmium is also notable for its high yield stress: the c/a\nanomalies lie well within the differential strains which osmium can support. We\npropose that observed c/a changes can arise from mechanical yield of\ncrystallites with strong preferred orientation under high deviatoric stress in\nthe experimental data.

    "summary": "Electron hydrodynamics arises when momentum-relaxing scattering processes are\nslow compared to momentum-conserving ones. While the microscopic details\nnecessary to satisfy this condition are material-specific, experimentally\naccessible current densities share remarkable similarities. We study the\ndependence of electron hydrodynamic flows on the rates of momentum-relaxing and\nmomentum-conserving scattering processes in a microscopics-agnostic way. We\ndevelop a framework for generating random collision operators which respect\ncrystal symmetries and conservation laws and which have a tunable ratio between\nthe momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing lifetimes. Using various random\ninstances of these collision operators, we calculate macroscopic electron\nviscosity tensors and solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in a channel\ngeometry over a grid of momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing lifetimes,\nand for different crystal symmetry groups. We find that different random\ncollision operators using the same lifetimes produce very similar current\ndensity profiles, meaning that the current density is primarily a probe of the\noverall rates of momentum conservation and relaxation. By contrast, the\nviscosity tensor varies substantially at fixed lifetimes, meaning that\nproperties like channel resistance provide detailed probes of the underlying\nscattering processes. This suggests that, while details of the scattering\nprocess are imprinted in the electronic viscosity tensor, for many applications\ntheoretical calculations of hydrodynamic electron flows can use\nexperimentally-available lifetimes within a spatially-resolved BTE framework\nrather than requiring the costly computation of ab initio collision operators.",

However, searching these databases to find promising\ncandidate materials for quantum technology applications is a major challenge.\nTherefore, we have developed a framework for the automated discovery of\nsemiconductor host platforms for QT using material informatics and machine\nlearning methods, resulting in a dataset consisting of over $25.000$ materials\nand nearly $5000$ physics-informed features. Three approaches were devised,\nnamed the Ferrenti, extended Ferrenti and the empirical approach, to label data\nfor the supervised machine learning (ML) methods logistic regression, decision\ntrees, random forests and gradient boosting. We find that of the three, the\nempirical approach relying exclusively on findings from the literature\npredicted substantially fewer candidates than the other two approaches with a\nclear distinction between suitable and unsuitable candidates when comparing the\ntwo largest eigenvalues in the covariance matrix. In contrast to expectations\nfrom the literature and that found for the Ferrenti and extended Ferrenti\napproaches focusing on band gap and ionic character, the ML methods from the\nempirical approach highlighted features related to symmetry and crystal\nstructure, including bond length, orientation and radial distribution, as\ninfluential when predicting a material as suitable for QT. All three approaches\nand all four ML methods agreed on a subset of $47$ eligible candidates %(to a\nprobability of $>50 \\ \\%$) of $8$ elemental, $29$ binary, and $10$ tertiary\ncompounds, and provide a basis for further material explorations towards\nquantum technology.",

ROSA is computationally cheap and\nis shown to accurately predict a range of material properties. These simple and\nintuitive class of descriptors are generated from the energetics of a material\nat a low level of theory using an incomplete ab initio calculation. We\ndemonstrate how the incorporation of ROSA descriptors in ML-based property\nprediction leads to accurate predictions over a wide range of crystals,\namorphized crystals, metal-organic frameworks and molecules.

    "summary": "Fundamental differences between materials originate from the unique nature of\ntheir constituent chemical elements. Before specific differences emerge\naccording to the precise ratios of elements in a given crystal structure, a\nmaterial can be represented by the set of its constituent chemical elements. By\nworking at the level of the periodic table, assessment of materials at the\nlevel of their phase fields reduces the combinatorial complexity to accelerate\nscreening, and circumvents the challenges associated with composition-level\napproaches such as poor extrapolation within phase fields, and the\nimpossibility of exhaustive sampling. This early stage discrimination combined\nwith evaluation of novelty of phase fields aligns with the outstanding\nexperimental challenge of identifying new areas of chemistry to investigate, by\nprioritising which elements to combine in a reaction. Here, we demonstrate that\nphase fields can be assessed with respect to the maximum expected value of a\ntarget functional property and ranked according to chemical novelty. We develop\nand present PhaseSelect, an end-to-end machine learning model that combines the\nrepresentation, classification, regression and ranking of phase fields. First,\nPhaseSelect constructs elemental characteristics from the co-occurrence of\nchemical elements in computationally and experimentally reported materials,\nthen it employs attention mechanisms to learn representation for phase fields\nand assess their functional performance. At the level of the periodic table,\nPhaseSelect quantifies the probability of observing a functional property,\nestimates its value within a phase field and also ranks a phase field novelty,\nwhich we demonstrate with significant accuracy for three avenues of materials\napplications for high-temperature superconductivity, high-temperature\nmagnetism, and targeted bandgap energy.",

    "summary": "Message-passing neural networks (MPNN) have shown extremely high efficiency\nand accuracy in predicting the physical properties of molecules and crystals,\nand are expected to become the next-generation material simulation tool after\nthe density functional theory (DFT). However, there is currently a lack of a\ngeneral MPNN framework for directly predicting the tensor properties of the\ncrystals. In this work, a general framework for the prediction of tensor\nproperties was proposed: the tensor property of a crystal can be decomposed\ninto the average of the tensor contributions of all the atoms in the crystal,\nand the tensor contribution of each atom can be expanded as the sum of the\ntensor projections in the directions of the edges connecting the atoms. On this\nbasis, the edge-based expansions of force vectors, Born effective charges\n(BECs), dielectric (DL) and piezoelectric (PZ) tensors were proposed. These\nexpansions are rotationally equivariant, while the coefficients in these tensor\nexpansions are rotationally invariant scalars which are similar to physical\nquantities such as formation energy and band gap. The advantage of this tensor\nprediction framework is that it does not require the network itself to be\nequivariant. Therefore, in this work, we directly designed the edge-based\ntensor prediction graph neural network (ETGNN) model on the basis of the\ninvariant graph neural network to predict tensors. The validity and high\nprecision of this tensor prediction framework were shown by the tests of ETGNN\non the extended systems, random perturbed structures and JARVIS-DFT datasets.\nThis tensor prediction framework is general for nearly all the GNNs and can\nachieve higher accuracy with more advanced GNNs in the future.",

    "summary": "The success of machine learning (ML) in materials property prediction depends\nheavily on how the materials are represented for learning. Two dominant\nfamilies of material descriptors exist, one that encodes crystal structure in\nthe representation and the other that only uses stoichiometric information with\nthe hope of discovering new materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) in\nparticular have excelled in predicting material properties within chemical\naccuracy. However, current GNNs are limited to only one of the above two\navenues owing to the little overlap between respective material\nrepresentations. Here, we introduce a new concept of formula graph which\nunifies stoichiometry-only and structure-based material descriptors. We further\ndevelop a self-attention integrated GNN that assimilates a formula graph and\nshow that the proposed architecture produces material embeddings transferable\nbetween the two domains. Our model can outperform some previously proposed\nstructure-agnostic models and their structure-based counterparts while\nexhibiting better sample efficiency and faster convergence. Finally, the model\nis applied in a challenging exemplar to predict the complex dielectric function\nof materials and nominate new substances that potentially exhibit\nepsilon-near-zero phenomena.",

On the other hand, along an isothermal pathways, a\nnon-linear increase is observed in the elastic constants with a significant\ndecrease in anisotropy.

Taking into account rare nucleation events or\nstructural relaxation under deep undercooling conditions requires much larger\nlength scales and longer time scales than those achievable by \\textit{ab\ninitio} molecular dynamics (AIMD). This problem is addressed by means of\nclassical MD simulations using a well established high dimensional neural\nnetwork potential trained on a relevant set of configurations generated by\nAIMD. Our dataset contains various crystalline structures and liquid states at\ndifferent pressures, including their time fluctuations in a wide range of\ntemperatures considering only their energy labels. Applied to elemental\naluminium, the resulting potential is shown to be efficient to reproduce the\nbasic structural, dynamics and thermodynamic quantities in the liquid and\nundercooled states without the need to include neither explicitly the forces\nnor all kind of configurations in the training procedure. The early stage of\ncrystallization is further investigated on a much larger scale with one million\natoms, allowing us to unravel features of the homogeneous nucleation mechanisms\nin the fcc phase at ambient pressure as well as in the bcc phase at high\npressure with unprecedented accuracy close to the \\textit{ab initio} one.

While most mechanical studies of graphene focused on\nthe strength and brittle fracture behavior, its ductility, plastic deformation,\nand the possible brittle-to-ductile transition, which are important for\nhigh-temperature mechanical performance and applications, still remain much\nless understood. Here the mechanical response and deformation dynamics of\ngraphene grain boundaries are investigated through a phase field crystal\nmodeling, showing the pivotal effects of temperature and local dislocation\nstructure. Our results indicate that even at relatively high temperature\n(around 3350 K), the system is still governed by a brittle fracture and\ncracking dynamics as found in previous low-temperature experimental and\natomistic studies. We also identify another type of failure dynamics with\nlow-angle grain boundary disintegration. When temperature increases a\ntransition to plastic deformation is predicted. The appearance of plastic flow\nat ultrahigh temperature, particularly the phenomenon of jerky plasticity, is\nattributed to the stick and climb-glide motion of dislocations around the grain\nboundary. The corresponding mechanism is intrinsic to two-dimensional systems,\nand governed by the competition between the driving force of accumulated local\nstress and the defect pinning effect, without the traditional pathways of\ndislocation generation needed in three-dimensional materials.",

We study these effects through the phase field crystal modeling of\nembedded curved grains in two-dimensional hexagonal materials, by examining and\ncomparing the results of grain rotation, shrinking, and grain boundary dynamics\nover the full range of misorientation in binary systems of hexagonal boron\nnitride and single-component graphene monolayers. Calculations of the relation\nbetween grain radius and misorientation angle during time evolution reveal the\nnormal-tangential coupled motion of the grain boundary matching the Cahn-Taylor\nformulation, as well as the transition to sliding and the regime of grain\nmotion without rotation. The key effect of two-component sublattice ordering is\nidentified, showing as a dual behavior of both positive and negative coupling\nmodes with grains rotating towards increasing and decreasing angles, which is\nabsent in two-dimensional single-component systems. The corresponding\nmechanisms are beyond the purely geometric considerations and require the\nenergetic contribution from the difference between heteroelemental and\nhomoelemental atomic bondings and the subsequent availability of a diverse\nvariety of defect core structures and transformations.

Our system consists of a binary mixture of\noligomers and rod-like mesogens. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD)\nsimulations we infer the topology of the temperature-dependent free energy\nlandscape from the probability distributions of excess volume fraction of the\ncomponents. The mixture exhibits nematic and smectic phases as a function of\ntwo temperature scales, the nematic-isotropic temperature $T_{NI}$ and the\n$T_c$, the transition that governs the polymer demixing. Using a mean-field\nfree energy of polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs), with suitably chosen\nparameter values, we construct a mean-field phase diagram that\nsemi-quantitatively match those obtained from CGMD simulations. Our results are\napplicable to mixtures of synthetic and biological macromolecules that undergo\nphase separation and are orientable, thereby giving rise to the liquid\ncrystalline phases.",

Discovering materials with large\nmagnetic moments is therefore an increasing priority.

Crystal\ngraph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), materials graph network (MEGNet)\nand random forests are trained on the Materials Project database that contains\nthe results of high-throughput DFT predictions. For random forests, we use a\nstochastic method to select nearly one hundred relevant descriptors based on\nchemical composition and crystal structure. This gives results that are\ncomparable to those of neural networks. The comparison between these different\nmachine learning approaches gives an estimate of the errors for our predictions\non the ICSD database.

However, currently, the computationally expensive\nfirst principle calculation based crystal structure prediction algorithms are\napplicable to relatively small systems and are out of reach of most materials\nresearchers due to the requirement of high computing resources or the software\ncost related to ab initio code such as VASP. Several computational teams have\nused an element substitution approach for generating or predicting new\nstructures, but usually in an ad hoc way. Here we develop a template based\ncrystal structure prediction algorithm (TCSP) and its companion web server,\nwhich makes this tool to be accessible to all materials researchers. Our\nalgorithm uses elemental/chemical similarity and oxidation states to guide the\nselection of template structures and then rank them based on the substitution\ncompatibility and can return multiple predictions with ranking scores in a few\nminutes. Benchmark study on the ~98,290 formulas of the Materials Project\ndatabase using leave-one-out evaluation shows that our algorithm can achieve\nhigh accuracy (for 13,145 target structures, TCSP predicted their structures\nwith RMSD < 0.1) for a large portion of the formulas. We have also used TCSP to\ndiscover new materials of the Ga-B-N system showing its potential for\nhigh-throughput materials discovery.

Recently a complete classification of emergent particles in 3D\nnonmagnetic crystals, which described by the type-II magnetic space groups\n(MSGs), has been established. However, a systematic investigation of emergent\nparticles in magnetic crystals has not yet been performed, due to the\ncomplexity of the symmetries of magnetically ordered structures. Here, we\naddress this challenging task by exploring the possibilities of the emergent\nparticles in the 674 type-III MSGs. Based on effective k.p Hamiltonian and our\nclassification of emergent particles [Yu et al., Sci. Bull. 67, 375 (2022)\nDOI:10.1016/j.scib.2021.10.023], we identify all possible emergent particles,\nincluding spinful and spinless, essential and accidental particles in the\ntype-III MSGs. We find that all emergent particles in type-III MSGs also exist\nin type-II MSGs, with only one exception, i.e. the combined quadratic nodal\nline and nodal surface (QNL/NS). Moreover, tabulations of the emergent\nparticles in each of the 674 type-III MSGs, together with the symmetry\noperations, the small corepresentations, the effective k.p Hamiltonians, and\nthe topological character of these particles, are explicitly presented.\nRemarkably, combining this work and our homemade SpaceGroupIrep and MSGCorep\npackages will provide an effcient way to search topological magnetic materials\nwith novel quasiparticles.",

We\nfurther show that the normalizing flow framework furnishes a reference\nthermodynamic system, very close to the real thermodynamic system under\nconsideration, that is suitable for the well-established free energy\nperturbation methods to determine accurate free energy of solids. We then apply\nthe normalizing flow to two problems: temperature-dependent Gibbs free energy\nof perfect crystal and formation free energy of monovacancy defect in a model\nsystem of diamond cubic Si. The results obtained from the normalizing flow are\nshown to be in good agreement with that obtained from independent\nwell-established free energy methods.",

    "summary": "Phase-field models of microstructural pattern formation during alloy\nsolidification are commonly solved numerically using the finite-difference\nmethod, which is ideally suited to carry out computationally efficient\nsimulations on massively parallel computer architectures such as Graphic\nProcessing Units. However, one known drawback of this method is that the\ndiscretization of differential terms involving spatial derivatives introduces a\nspurious lattice anisotropy that can influence the solid-liquid interface\ndynamics. We find that this influence is significant for the case of\npolycrystalline dendritic solidification, where the crystal axes of different\ngrains do not generally coincide with the reference axes of the\nfinite-difference lattice. In particular, we find that with the commonly used\nfinite-difference implementation of the quantitative phase-field model of\nbinary alloy solidification, both the operating state of the dendrite tip and\nthe dendrite growth orientation are strongly affected by the lattice\nanisotropy. To circumvent this problem, we use known methods in both real and\nFourier space to derive finite-difference approximations of leading\ndifferential terms in 2D and 3D that are isotropic at order $h^2$ of the\nlattice spacing $h$. Importantly, those terms include the divergence of the\nanti-trapping current that is found to have a critical influence on pattern\nselection. The 2D and 3D discretizations use an approximated form of the\nanti-trapping current that facilitates the Fourier-space derivation of the\nassociated isotropic differential operator at $O(h^2)$, but we also derive a 2D\ndiscretization of the standard form of this current. Finally, we present 2D and\n3D phase-field simulations of alloy solidification, showing that the isotropic\nfinite-difference implementations can dramatically reduce spurious lattice\nanisotropy effects.",

    "summary": "Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing\nchallenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because\nstable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible\nperiodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy\nminimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the\nstructure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between\ndifferent atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and\noften lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational\nAutoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material\nstability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the\ndecoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic\ncoordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy\nbonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes\ninteractions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation,\nrotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in\nthree tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid,\ndiverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a\nspecific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation\nmetrics for the broader machine learning community.",

An\nartificial intelligence-based symmetry selection strategy was subsequently\ndevised to select the low-lying subspaces with high symmetries for global\nexploration and in-depth exploitation.

The effectiveness of\nthe method has been validated by successful prediction of the candidate\nstructures of binary Lennard-Jones mixtures and high-pressure phase of ice,\ncontaining more than one hundred atoms in the simulation cell. The work,\ntherefore, opens up an opportunity towards achieving the long-sought goal for\ncrystal structure prediction of complex systems.",

However, all these models suffer from their inability to scale up\nthe models due to the over-smoothing issue of their message-passing GNN\narchitecture. Here we propose a novel graph attention neural network model\nDeeperGATGNN with differentiable group normalization and skip-connections,\nwhich allows to train very deep graph neural network models (e.g. 30 layers\ncompared to 3-9 layers in previous works). Through systematic benchmark studies\nover six benchmark datasets for energy and band gap predictions, we show that\nour scalable DeeperGATGNN model needs little costly hyper-parameter tuning for\ndifferent datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performances\nover five properties out of six with up to 10\\% improvement. Our work shows\nthat to deal with the high complexity of mapping the crystal materials\nstructures to their properties, large-scale very deep graph neural networks are\nneeded to achieve robust performances.",

The capability to specify\ngeneral phase-field models is primarily achieved by developing a novel symbolic\nalgebra functionality that can formulate mathematical expressions at compile\ntime, is able to apply rules of symbolic algebra such as distribution,\nfactoring and automatic simplification, and support user-driven expression tree\nmanipulation. A modular design based on the CC++ template meta-programming\nparadigm is applied to the symbolic algebra library and general API\nimplementation to minimize application runtime and increase the accessibility\nof the API for third party development. \\textit{SymPhas} is written in C/CC++\nand emphasizes high-performance capabilities via parallelization with OpenMP\nand the CC++ standard library. \\textit{SymPhas} is equipped with a forward\nEuler solver and a semi-implicit Fourier spectral solver.

In blind tests on 60 ternary compositions diversely selected\nfrom the experimental database, SPINNER successfully identifies experimental\n(or theoretically more stable) phases for ~80% of materials within 5000\ngenerations, entailing up to half a million structure evaluations for each\ncomposition. When benchmarked against previous data mining or DFT-based\nevolutionary predictions, SPINNER identifies more stable phases in the majority\nof cases.

Our model demonstrates\nexceptionally high precision in discovering new theoretically stable materials,\nidentifying 1,569 materials that lie below the known convex hull of previously\ncalculated materials from just 5,675 ab-initio calculations.

We\npresent here a revised and updated version (v2.0) of MAELAS, where we added a\nnew methodology to compute anisotropic magnetoelastic constants from a linear\nfitting of the energy versus applied strain. We analyze and compare the\naccuracy of both methods showing that the new approach is more reliable and\nrobust than the one implemented in version 1.0, especially for non-cubic\ncrystal symmetries. This analysis also help us to find that the accuracy of the\nmethod implemented in version 1.0 could be improved by using deformation\ngradients derived from the equilibrium magnetoelastic strain tensor, as well as\npotential future alternative methods like the strain optimization method.\nAdditionally, we clarify the role of the demagnetized state in the fractional\nchange in length, and derive the expression for saturation magnetostriction for\npolycrystals with trigonal, tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. In\nthis new version, we also fix some issues related to trigonal crystal symmetry\nfound in version 1.0.",

Valence electron\nenergy-loss spectra, featuring signals originating from band gap transitions,\nare acquired on defect-free sample regions of a BaSnO$_{3}$ single crystal.\nThese high-energy-resolution measurements are able to capture also very weak\nexcitations below the optical gap, attributed to indirect transitions. By\ntemperature-dependent optical absorption measurements, we assess band-gap\nrenormalization effects induced by electron-phonon coupling. Overall, we find\nfor the effective electronic mass, the direct and the indirect gap, the optical\ngap, as well as the absorption onsets and spectra, excellent agreement between\nboth experimental techniques and the theoretical many-body results, supporting\nalso the picture of a phonon-mediated mechanism where indirect transitions are\nactivated by phonon-induced symmetry lowering.

Whilst group\ntheory considerations and standard ab initio calculations are helpful, they are\noften valid only for single crystals. In this paper, we introduce a method for\ncomputing Raman spectra of polycrystalline materials from first principles. We\nstart from the standard approach based on the (Placzek) rotation invariants of\nthe Raman tensors and extend it to include the effect of the coupling between\nthe lattice vibrations and the induced electric field, and the electro-optic\ncontribution, relevant for polar materials like ferroelectrics. As exemplified\nby applying the method to rhombohedral BaTiO3, AlN, and LiNbO3, such an\nextension brings the simulated Raman spectrum to a much better correspondence\nwith the experimental one. Additional advantages of the method are that it is\ngeneral, permits automation, and thus can be used in high-throughput fashion.",

This is the widest range\nreported for self-consistent electronic shell structure calculations. Elements\nof the same ratio of atomic weight to atomic number were predicted to asymptote\nto the same $T=0$ isotherm, suggesting that, contrary to recent studies of the\ncrystallization of WDs, the amount of gravitational energy that could be\nreleased by separation of oxygen and carbon is small. A generalized Lindemann\ncriterion based on the amplitude of the ion-thermal oscillations calculated\nusing atom-in-jellium theory, previously used to extrapolate melt curves for\nmetals, was found to reproduce previous thermodynamic studies of the melt curve\nof the one component plasma with a choice of vibration amplitude consistent\nwith low pressure results. For elements for which low pressure melting\nsatisfies the same amplitude criterion, such as Al, this melt model thus gives\na likely estimate of the melt curve over the full range of normal electronic\nmatter; for the other elements, it provides a useful constraint on the melt\nlocus.",

    "summary": "One of the most important aims of grain boundary modeling is to predict the\nevolution of a large collection of grains in phenomena such as abnormal grain\ngrowth, coupled grain boundary motion, and recrystallization that occur under\nextreme thermomechanical loads. A unified framework to study the coevolution of\ngrain boundaries with bulk plasticity has recently been developed by Admal et\nal. (2018), which is based on modeling grain boundaries as continuum\ndislocations governed by an energy based on the Kobayashi--Warren--Carter (KWC)\nmodel (Kobayashi et al., 1998, 2000). While the resulting unified model\ndemonstrates coupled grain boundary motion and polygonization (seen in\nrecrystallization), it is restricted to grain boundary energies of the\nRead--Shockley type, which applies only to small misorientation angles. In\naddition, the implementation of the unified model using finite elements\ninherits the computational challenges of the KWC model that originate from the\nsingular diffusive nature of its governing equations. The main goal of this\nstudy is to generalize the KWC functional to grain boundary energies beyond the\nRead--Shockley-type that respect the bicrystallography of grain boundaries. The\ncomputational challenges of the KWC model are addressed by developing a\nthresholding method that relies on a primal dual algorithm and the fast\nmarching method, resulting in an O(NlogN) algorithm, where N is the number of\ngrid points. We validate the model by demonstrating the Herring angle relation,\nfollowed by a study of the grain microstructure evolution in a two-dimensional\nface-centered cubic copper polycrystal with crystal symmetry-invariant grain\nboundary energy data obtained from the lattice matching method of Runnels et\nal.

    "summary": "Significant progress in many classes of materials could be made with the\navailability of experimentally-derived large datasets composed of atomic\nidentities and three-dimensional coordinates. Methods for visualizing the local\natomic structure, such as atom probe tomography (APT), which routinely generate\ndatasets comprised of millions of atoms, are an important step in realizing\nthis goal. However, state-of-the-art APT instruments generate noisy and sparse\ndatasets that provide information about elemental type, but obscure atomic\nstructures, thus limiting their subsequent value for materials discovery. The\napplication of a materials fingerprinting process, a machine learning algorithm\ncoupled with topological data analysis, provides an avenue by which\nhere-to-fore unprecedented structural information can be extracted from an APT\ndataset. As a proof of concept, the material fingerprint is applied to\nhigh-entropy alloy APT datasets containing body-centered cubic (BCC) and\nface-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structures. A local atomic configuration\ncentered on an arbitrary atom is assigned a topological descriptor, with which\nit can be characterized as a BCC or FCC lattice with near perfect accuracy,\ndespite the inherent noise in the dataset. This successful identification of a\nfingerprint is a crucial first step in the development of algorithms which can\nextract more nuanced information, such as chemical ordering, from existing\ndatasets of complex materials.",

An ionic-radius\nregression model for Shannon's database is developed as a function of the\nperiod number, the valence orbital configuration, OS, CN, and Ionization\nPotential. In the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model, the reached R-square\n$R^2$ accuracy is 99\\% while the root mean square error of radii is 0.0332 \\AA.\nThe optimized GPR model is then employed for predicting a new set of ionic\nradii for uncommon combinations of OS and CN extracted by harnessing crystal\nstructures from materials project databases.

    "summary": "Recently acoustic signature of dislocation avalanches in HCP materials was\nfound to be long tailed in size and energy, suggesting critical dynamics. Even\nmore recently, the intermittent plastic response was found to be generic for\nmicro- and nano-sized systems independently of their crystallographic symmetry.\nThese rather remarkable discoveries are reviewed in this paper in the\nperspective of the recent studies performed in our group. We discuss the\nphysical origin and the scaling properties of plastic fluctuations and address\nthe nature of their dependence on crystalline symmetry, system size, and\ndisorder content. A particular emphasis is placed on the associated emergent\nbehaviors, including the formation of dislocation structures, and on our\nability to temper plastic fluctuations by alloying. We also discuss the\n\"smaller is wilder\" size effect that culminates in a paradoxical crack-free\nbrittle behavior of very small, initially dislocation free crystals. We show\nthat the implied transition between different rheological behaviors is\nregulated by the ratio of length scales $R=L/l$, where $L$ is the system size\nand $l$ is the internal length. We link this new size effect with other related\nphenomena like size dependence of strength (\"smaller is stronger\") and the size\ninduced switch between different hardening mechanisms. One of the technological\nchallenges in nanoscience is to tame the intermittency of plastic flow. We show\nthat this task can be accomplished by generating tailored quenched disorder\nwhich allows one to control micro- and nano-scale forming and opens new\nperspectives in micro-metallurgy and structural engineering of ultra-small\nload-carrying elements. These results could not be achieved by conventional\nmethods that do not explicitly consider the stochastic nature of collective\ndislocation dynamics.",

A related transition has\nbeen predicted in colloidal crystals. To understand the nature of this\ntransition, we study delocalization in self-assembled, size asymmetric binary\ncolloidal crystals using a generalized molecular dynamics model. Focusing on\nBCC lattices, we observe a smooth change from localized-to-delocalized\ninterstitial particles for a variety of interaction strengths. Thermodynamic\narguments, mainly the absence of a discontinuity in the heat capacity, suggest\nthat the passage from localization-to-delocalization is continuous and not a\nphase transition. This change is enhanced by lattice vibrations, and the\ntemperature of the onset of delocalization can be tuned by the strength of the\ninteraction between the colloid species. Therefore, the localized and\ndelocalized regimes of the sublattice are dominated by enthalpic and entropic\ndriving forces, respectively. This work sets the stage for future studies of\nsublattice melting in colloidal systems with different stoichiometries and\nlattice types, and it provides insights into superionic materials, which have\npotential for application in energy storage technologies.",

However, these models trained with small datasets are usually not\napplicable to generic lattice parameter prediction of materials with diverse\ncompositions. Herein, we report MLatticeABC, a random forest machine learning\nmodel with a new descriptor set for lattice unit cell edge length ($a,b,c$)\nprediction which achieves an R2 score of 0.979 for lattice parameter $a$ of\ncubic crystals and significant performance improvement for other crystal\nsystems as well.

Adding the effect of strong particle-hole interactions\nfor (EDT-TTF-I$_2$)$_2$(DDQ)$\\cdot($CH$_3$CN) and TSeF-TCNQ opens an excitonic\ngap in the order of 60 meV and 100 meV, which is in good agreement with\nprevious experiments on these materials.",

To efficiently explore the DBSP, we develop an unbiased random search\napproach based on both the piling up method to generate initial structures in\nan unbiased way and the iterative balance method to optimize the volume of a\nunit cell while keeping the overlap of hard spheres minimized. With those two\nmethods, we have discovered 12 putative DBSP and thereby the phase diagram is\nupdated, while our results are consistent with those of the previous study\n[Hopkins et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 021130 (2012)] with a small correction for\nthe case of 12 or fewer spheres in the unit cell. The 5 of the new 12 densest\npackings are discovered in the small radius range of $0.42 \\le \\alpha \\le 0.50$\nwhere several structures are competitive to each other with respect to packing\nfraction. Through the exhaustive search, diverse dense packings are discovered\nand accordingly we find that packing structures achieve high packing fractions\nby introducing distortion and/or combining a few local dense structural units.\nFurthermore, we investigate the correspondence of the DBSP with crystals based\non the space group. The result shows that many structural units in real\ncrystals, e.g., $\\mathrm{LaH_{10}}$ and $\\mathrm{SrGe_{2-\\delta}}$ being\nhigh-pressure phases, can be understood as DBSP. The correspondence implies\nthat the densest sphere packings can be used effectively as structural\nprototypes for searching complex crystal structures, especially for\nhigh-pressure phases.",

    "summary": "Localized bases play an important role in understanding electronic structure.\nIn periodic insulators, a natural choice of localized basis is given by the\nWannier functions which depend a choice of unitary transform known as a gauge\ntransformation. Over the past few decades, there have been many works which\nhave focused on optimizing the choice of gauge so that the corresponding\nWannier functions are maximally localized or reflect some symmetry of the\nunderlying system. In this work, we consider fully non-periodic materials where\nthe usual Wannier functions are not well defined and gauge optimization is\nimpossible. To tackle the problem of calculating exponentially localized\ngeneralized Wannier functions in both periodic and non-periodic system we\ndiscuss the \"Iterated Projected Position (IPP)\" algorithm. The IPP algorithm is\nbased on matrix diagonalization and therefore unlike optimization based\napproaches it does not require initialization and cannot get stuck at a local\nminimum. Furthermore, the IPP algorithm is guaranteed by a rigorous analysis to\nproduce exponentially localized functions under certain mild assumptions. We\nnumerically demonstrate that the IPP algorithm can be used to calculate\nexponentially localized bases for the Haldane model, the Kane-Mele model (in\nboth $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant even and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant odd phases),\nand the $p_x + i p_y$ model on a quasi-crystal lattice.",

In comparison, single-element 2D materials with a\ntriangular lattice symmetry have not received due attention. Here, taking Pb as\nan example, we investigate the triangular-lattice monolayer made of group-IV\natoms employing first-principles density functional theory calculations. The\nflat Pb monolayer supports a mirror-symmetry-protected spinless nodal line in\nthe absence spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The introduction of an out-of-plane\nbuckling creates a glide mirror, protecting an anisotropic Dirac nodal loop.\nBoth flat and buckled Pb monolayers become topologically trivial after\nincluding SOC. A large buckling will make the Pb sheet a 2D semiconductor with\nsymmetry-protected Dirac points below the Fermi level. The electronic\nstructures of other group-IV triangular lattices such as Ge and Sn demonstrate\nstrong similarity to Pb. We further design a quasi-3D crystal PbHfO$_2$ by\nalternately stacking Pb and 1T-HfO$_2$ monolayers. The new compound PbHfO$_2$\nis dynamically stable and retains the properties of Pb monolayer. By applying\nepitaxial strains to PbHfO$_2$, it is possible to drive an insulator-to-metal\ntransition coupled with an anti-ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition.\nOur results suggest the potential of the 2D triangular lattice as a\ncomplimentary platform to design new type of broadly-defined Xenes.",

For electron\nand X-ray diffraction methods it is possible to develop indexing tools which\ncompare measured and analytically computed patterns to decode the structure and\nrelative orientation within local regions of interest. Consequently, a number\nof numerically efficient and automated software tools exist to solve the above\ncharacterisation tasks.\n  For atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, however, the strategy of making\ncomparisons between measured and analytically computed patterns is less robust\nbecause many APT datasets may contain substantial noise. Given that general\nenough predictive models for such noise remain elusive, crystallography tools\nfor APT face several limitations: Their robustness to noise, and therefore,\ntheir capability to identify and distinguish different crystal structures and\norientation is limited. In addition, the tools are sequential and demand\nsubstantial manual interaction. In combination, this makes robust uncertainty\nquantifying with automated high-throughput studies of the latent\ncrystallographic information a difficult task with APT data.\n  To improve the situation, we review the existent methods and discuss how they\nlink to those in the diffraction communities. With this we modify some of the\nAPT methods to yield more robust descriptors of the atomic arrangement. We\nreport how this enables the development of an open-source software tool for\nstrong-scaling and automated identifying of crystal structure and mapping\ncrystal orientation in nanocrystalline APT datasets with multiple phases.",

We analyze the\nreliability of the $1/N_\\text{PW}$ basis set extrapolation and find that is\nwell-founded with narrow distributions of $r^2$ peaked very close to 1.\nFinally, we explore the validity of the scissors operator approximation\nconcluding that it is generally not valid for reasonable error tolerances.

    "summary": "Solutions to the differential equations of linear elasticity in the continuum\nlimit in arbitrary crystal symmetry are known only for steady-state\ndislocations of arbitrary character, i.e. line defects moving at constant\nvelocity. Troubled by singularities at certain `critical' velocities (typically\nclose to certain sound speeds), these dislocation fields are thought to be too\nidealized, and divergences are usually attributed to neglecting the finite size\nof the core and to the restriction to constant velocity. In the isotropic\nlimit, accelerating pure screw and edge dislocations were studied some time\nago. A generalization to anisotropic crystals has been attempted for pure screw\nand edge dislocations only for some special cases. This work aims to fill the\ngap of deriving a general anisotropic solution for pure screw dislocations\napplicable to slip systems featuring a reflection symmetry, a prerequisite to\nstudying pure screw dislocations without mixing with edge dislocations. Further\ngeneralizations to arbitrary mixed dislocations as well as regularizations of\nthe dislocation core are beyond the scope of this paper and are left for future\nwork.",

The machine-learning\npotential such as the neural network potential (NNP) is poised to meet this\nrequirement but a dearth of information on the crystal structure poses a\nchallenge in choosing training sets. Herein we propose constructing the\ntraining set from densityfunctional-theory (DFT) based dynamical trajectories\nof liquid and quenched amorphous phases, which does not require any preceding\ninformation on material structures except for the chemical composition. To\ndemonstrate suitability of the trained NNP in the crystal structure prediction,\nwe compare NNP and DFT energies for Ba2AgSi3, Mg2SiO4, LiAlCl4, and InTe2O5F\nover experimental phases as well as low-energy crystal structures that are\ngenerated theoretically. For every material, we find strong correlations\nbetween DFT and NNP energies, ensuring that the NNPs can properly rank energies\namong low-energy crystalline structures. We also find that the evolutionary\nsearch using the NNPs can identify low-energy metastable phases more\nefficiently than the DFTbased approach.

    "summary": "An efficient machine-learning-based method combined with a conventional local\noptimization technique has been proposed for exploring local energy minima of\ninterstitial species in a crystal. In the proposed method, an effective initial\npoint for local optimization is sampled at each iteration from a given feasible\nset in the search space. The effective initial point is here defined as the\ngrid point that most likely converges to a new local energy minimum by local\noptimization and/or is located in the vicinity of the boundaries between energy\nbasins. Specifically, every grid point in the feasible set is classified by the\npredicted label indicating the local energy minimum that the grid point\nconverges to. The classifier is created and updated at every iteration using\nthe already-known information on the local optimizations at the earlier\niterations, which is based on the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM\nclassifier uses our original kernel function designed as reflecting the\nsymmetries of both host crystal and interstitial species. The most distant\nunobserved point on the classification boundaries from the observed points is\nsampled as the next initial point for local optimization. The proposed method\nis applied to three model cases, i.e., the six-hump camelback function, a\nproton in strontium zirconate with the orthorhombic perovskite structure, and a\nwater molecule in lanthanum sulfate with the monoclinic structure, to\ndemonstrate the high performance of the proposed method.",

    "summary": "Crystal structure prediction is now playing an increasingly important role in\ndiscovery of new materials. Global optimization methods such as genetic\nalgorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been combined with\nfirst principle free energy calculations to predict crystal structures given\ncomposition or only a chemical system. While these approaches can exploit\ncertain crystal patterns such as symmetry and periodicity in their search\nprocess, they usually do not exploit the large amount of implicit rules and\nconstraints of atom configurations embodied in the large number of known\ncrystal structures. They currently can only handle crystal structure prediction\nof relatively small systems. Inspired by the knowledge-rich protein structure\nprediction approach, herein we explore whether known geometric constraints such\nas the atomic contact map of a target crystal material can help predict its\nstructure given its space group information. We propose a global optimization\nbased algorithm, CMCrystal, for crystal structure reconstruction based on\natomic contact maps. Based on extensive experiments using six global\noptimization algorithms, we show that it is viable to reconstruct the crystal\nstructure given the atomic contact map for some crystal materials but more\nconstraints are needed for other target materials to achieve successful\nreconstruction. This implies that atomic interaction information learned from\nexisting materials can be used to improve crystal structure prediction.",

Crucially, the\ncrystal structure realizes a nonsymmorphic layer group that enforces a\nnontrivial global topology of the band structure with two Dirac cones lying\nperfectly at the Fermi level. The absence of electron/hole pockets makes\nPAI-graphene a pristine crystalline topological semimetal having anisotropic\nFermi velocities with a high value of $7.0 \\times 10^{5}$ m/s. We show that\nwhile the semimetallic property of the allotrope is robust against the\napplication of strain, the positions of the Dirac cone and the Fermi velocities\ncan be modified significantly with strain. Moreover, by combining strain along\nboth the x- and y-directions, two band inversions take place at $\\Gamma$\nleading to the annihilation of the Dirac nodes demonstrating the possibility of\nstrain-controlled conversion of a topological semimetal into a semiconductor.\nFinally we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence of the topological nodal\nphase in the form of a generalized Zak-phase argument finding a perfect\nagreement with the topological edge states computed for different\nedge-terminations.",

Applying the generative\nmodels on the binary Bi-Se system reveals that distinct crystal structures can\nbe obtained covering the whole composition range, and the phases on the convex\nhull can be reproduced after the generated structures are fully relaxed to the\nequilibrium.

The need to develop such a theory stems from the\nlack of studies that provide complete understanding of the underlying\nfundamental processes governing the transverse momentum distribution of\nphotoelectrons emitted from single crystals. For example, initial predictions\nbased on density-functional theory calculations of effective electron masses\nsuggested that the (111) surface of PbTe would produce very small MTEs ($\\leq$\n15 meV), whereas our experiments yielded MTEs ten to twenty times larger than\nthese predictions, and also exhibited a lower photoemission threshold than\npredicted. The ab initio framework presented in this manuscript correctly\nreproduces the magnitude of the MTEs from our measurements in PbTe(111) and\nalso the observed photoemission below the predicted threshold. Our results show\nthat photoexcitations into bulk-like states and coherent, many-body\nelectron-photon-phonon scattering processes, both of which initial predictions\nignored, indeed play important roles in photoemission from PbTe(111). Finally,\nfrom the lessons learned, we recommend a procedure for rapid computational\nscreening of potential single-crystal photocathodes for applications in\nnext-generation ultrafast electron diffraction and X-ray free-electron lasers,\nwhich will enable new, significant advances in condensed matter research.",

A more flexible NN\narchitecture proposed here expands the applicability of the stratified scheme\nfor an arbitrary number of elements. The full workflow in the NN development is\nmanaged with a customizable 'MAISE-NET' wrapper written in Python. The global\nstructure optimization capability in MAISE is based on an evolutionary\nalgorithm applicable for nanoparticles, films, and bulk crystals. A multitribe\nextension of the algorithm allows for an efficient simultaneous optimization of\nnanoparticles in a given size range.

In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new\ncrystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE)\npower factor, and combinations thereof. These generated crystals, absent in the\ntraining database, are validated by first-principles calculations. The success\nrates (number of first-principles-validated target-satisfying crystals/number\nof designed crystals) ranges between 7.1% and 38.9%.

We use a minimal\ninteger-valued automaton model of crystal plasticity to show that with growing\nvariance of quenched disorder, which can serve in this case as a proxy for\nincreasing size, sub-micron crystals undergo a crossover from spin-glass\nmarginality to criticality characterizing the second order brittle-to-ductile\n(BD) transition. We argue that this crossover is behind the non-universality of\nscaling exponents observed in physical and numerical experiments. The\nnon-universality emerges only if the quenched disorder is elastically\nincompatible and it disappears if the disorder is compatible.",

    "summary": "We develop and demonstrate the first general computational tool for finite\ndeformation static and dynamic dislocation mechanics. A finite element\nformulation of finite deformation (Mesoscale) Field Dislocation Mechanics\ntheory is presented. The model is a minimal enhancement of classical\ncrystal/$J_2$ plasticity that fundamentally accounts for polar/excess\ndislocations at the mesoscale. It has the ability to compute the static and\ndynamic finite deformation stress fields of arbitrary (evolving) dislocation\ndistributions in finite bodies of arbitrary shape and elastic anisotropy under\ngeneral boundary conditions. This capability is used to present a comparison of\nthe static stress fields, at finite and small deformations, for screw and edge\ndislocations, revealing heretofore unexpected differences. The computational\nframework is verified against the sharply contrasting predictions of\ngeometrically linear and nonlinear theories for the stress field of a spatially\nhomogeneous dislocation distribution in the body, as well as against other\nexact results of the theory. Verification tests of the time-dependent numerics\nare also presented. Size effects in crystal and isotropic versions of the\ntheory are shown to be a natural consequence of the model and are validated\nagainst available experimental data. With inertial effects incorporated, the\ndevelopment of an (asymmetric) propagating Mach cone is demonstrated in the\nfinite deformation theory when a dislocation moves at speeds greater than the\nlinear elastic shear wave speed of the material.",

In this work, we employ a crystal representation\nthat is inversion-free with a low memory requirement based on unit cell\ninformation and fractional atomic coordinates, and build the generative\nadversarial network (GAN) for crystal structures. The proposed model is then\napplied to the Mg-Mn-O ternary inorganic materials system to generate novel\nstructures with application as potential water-splitting photoanodes, and\ncombined with the evaluation of their photoanode properties for high-throughput\nvirtual screening (HTVS). The generative-HTVS system that we built predicts 23\nnew crystal structures with a reasonable predicted stability and bandgap.

In this work, we alleviate this issue by\nextending and generalizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks to\nsystems with planar periodicity, and train an ensemble of models to predict\nthermodynamic, mechanical, and electronic properties. To demonstrate the\nutility of this approach, we carry out a screening of nearly 45,000 structures\nfor two largely disjoint applications: namely, mechanically robust composites\nand photovoltaics. An analysis of the uncertainty associated with our methods\nindicates the ensemble of neural networks is well-calibrated and has errors\ncomparable with those from accurate first-principles density functional theory\ncalculations. The ensemble of models allows us to gauge the confidence of our\npredictions, and to find the candidates most likely to exhibit effective\nperformance in their applications. Since the datasets used in our screening\nwere combinatorically generated, we are also able to investigate, using an\ninnovative method, structural and compositional design principles that impact\nthe properties of the structures surveyed and which can act as a generative\nmodel basis for future material discovery through reverse engineering.

Currently both\ngraph and 3D voxel representation methods are based on the heterogeneous\nelements of the crystal structures. Here, we propose to use electronic charge\ndensity (ECD) as a generic unified 3D descriptor for materials property\nprediction with the advantage of possessing close relation with the physical\nand chemical properties of materials. We developed an ECD based 3D\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting elastic properties of\nmaterials, in which CNNs can learn effective hierarchical features with\nmultiple convolving and pooling operations. Extensive benchmark experiments\nover 2,170 Fm-3m face-centered-cubic (FCC) materials show that our ECD based\nCNNs can achieve good performance for elasticity prediction. Especially, our\nCNN models based on the fusion of elemental Magpie features and ECD descriptors\nachieved the best 5-fold cross-validation performance. More importantly, we\nshowed that our ECD based CNN models can achieve significantly better\nextrapolation performance when evaluated over non-redundant datasets where\nthere are few neighbor training samples around test samples. As additional\nvalidation, we evaluated the predictive performance of our models on 329\nmaterials of space group Fm-3m by comparing to DFT calculated values, which\nshows better prediction power of our model for bulk modulus than shear modulus.\nDue to the unified representation power of ECD, it is expected that our ECD\nbased CNN approach can also be applied to predict other physical and chemical\nproperties of crystalline materials.",

    "summary": "Accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations depends crucially on the\ninteratomic potential used to generate forces. The gold standard would be\nfirst-principles quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, but these become\nprohibitively expensive at large simulation scales. Machine learning (ML) based\npotentials aim for faithful emulation of QM at drastically reduced\ncomputational cost. The accuracy and robustness of an ML potential is primarily\nlimited by the quality and diversity of the training dataset. Using the\nprinciples of active learning (AL), we present a highly automated approach to\ndataset construction. The strategy is to use the ML potential under development\nto sample new atomic configurations and, whenever a configuration is reached\nfor which the ML uncertainty is sufficiently large, collect new QM data. Here,\nwe seek to push the limits of automation, removing as much expert knowledge\nfrom the AL process as possible. All sampling is performed using MD simulations\nstarting from an initially disordered configuration, and undergoing\nnon-equilibrium dynamics as driven by time-varying applied temperatures. We\ndemonstrate this approach by building an ML potential for aluminum (ANI-Al).\nAfter many AL iterations, ANI-Al teaches itself to predict properties like the\nradial distribution function in melt, liquid-solid coexistence curve, and\ncrystal properties such as defect energies and barriers. To demonstrate\ntransferability, we perform a 1.3M atom shock simulation, and show that ANI-Al\npredictions agree very well with DFT calculations on local atomic environments\nsampled from the nonequilibrium dynamics. Interestingly, the configurations\nappearing in shock appear to have been well sampled in the AL training dataset,\nin a way that we illustrate visually.",

    "summary": "The second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) processes, such as the photogalvanic\neffect and second-order harmonic generation (SHG), play crucial roles in\nprobing and controlling light-matter interactions for energy and device\napplications. To date, most studies of second-order NLO processes focus on\nmaterials with broken spatial inversion symmetry, such as proper ferroelectrics\nand noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetals. Nevertheless, inversion symmetry of\nShubnikov groups can be broken via spin-ordering in centrosymmetric crystals.\nUnfortunately, these materials are less common, and their NLO responses are\nusually weak. Combining quantum perturbation theory and first-principles\nsimulations, we predict a giant injection-current photogalvanic effect and SHG\nin a family of emerging axion insulators, the even septuple layers of MnBi2Te4\n(MBT) materials that exhibit the zero-plateau quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)\neffect. Their amplitudes of injection current and SHG are about two orders of\nmagnitude larger than those of widely used ferroelectrics, such as BiFeO3 and\nLiNbO3. Moreover, unlike the usual injection current observed under\ncircularly-polarized light, the injection photocurrent of MBTs only emerges\nunder linearly polarized light, making it convenient for device applications.\nThese unique characters are from a combination effect of parity-time symmetry,\nthree-fold rotation symmetry, and significant spin-orbit coupling. These\nenhanced NLO effects are valuable for characterizing subtle topological orders\nin QAH systems and also shed light on novel infrared photo-detector and\nphotovoltaic applications based on magnetic topological materials.",

Hexagonal 2D\nmaterials such as graphene support flows indistinguishable from those of an\nisotropic fluid. By contrast 3D materials including Weyl semimetals, exhibit\nsignificant deviations from isotropy. Breaking time-reversal symmetry, for\nexample in magnetic topological materials, introduces a non-dissipative Hall\ncomponent to the viscosity tensor. While this vanishes by isotropy in 3D,\nanisotropic materials can exhibit nonzero Hall viscosity components. We show\nthat in 3D anisotropic materials the electronic fluid stress can couple to the\nvorticity without breaking time-reversal symmetry.

Here we\nidentify by first-principles calculations robust 2D multiferroic behaviors in\ndecorated Fe2O3 monolayer, showcasing N@Fe2O3 as a prototypical case, where\nferroelectricity and ferromagnetism stem from the same origin, namely Fe\nd-orbit splitting induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion and associated crystal\nfield changes. The resulting ferromagnetic and ferroelectric polarization can\nbe effectively reversed and regulated by applied electric field or strain,\noffering efficient functionality.

    "summary": "The identification of general principles for stabilizing magnetic skyrmion\nphases in bulk materials over wide ranges of temperatures is a prerequisite to\nthe development of skyrmion-based spintronic devices. Lacunar spinels with the\nformula GaM4X8 with M=V, Mo; X=S, Se are a convenient case study towards this\ngoal as they are some of the first bulk systems suggested to host equilibrium\nchiral skyrmions far from the paramagnetic transition. We derive the magnetic\nphase diagrams likely to be observed in these materials, accounting for all\npossible magnetic interactions, and prove that skyrmion stability in the\nlacunar spinels is a general consequence of their crystal symmetry rather than\nthe details of the material chemistry. Our results are consistent with all\nexperimental reports in this space and demonstrate that the differences in the\nphase diagrams of particular spinel chemistries are determined by\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy, up to a normalization factor. We conclude that\nskyrmion formation over wide ranges of temperatures can be expected in all\nlacunar spinels, as well as in a wide range of uniaxial systems with low\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy.",

In general, PyXtal serves three purposes: (1) to generate\ncustom structures, (2) to modulate the structure by symmetry relations, (3) to\ninterface the existing structure prediction codes that require the generation\nof random symmetric structures. In addition, we provide several utilities that\nfacilitate the analysis of structures, including symmetry analysis, geometry\noptimization, and simulations of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).

In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a\nmachine learned inter-atomic potential, based on the Gaussian Approximation\nPotential framework, to model better neutron bombardment mechanisms in pristine\nW lattices. The MD potential is trained to reproduce realistic short-range\ndynamics, the liquid phase, and the material recrystallization, which are\nimportant for collision cascades. The formation of point defects is quantified\nand classified by a descriptor vector (DV) based method, which is independent\nof the sample temperature and its constituents, requiring only modest\ncomputational resources. The locations of vacancies are calculated by the\nk-d-tree algorithm. The analysis of the damage in the W samples is compared to\nresults obtained by EAM Finnis-Sinclair and Tersoff-ZBL potentials, at a sample\ntemperature of 300 K and a primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy range of 0.5-10\nkeV, where a good agreement with the reported number of Frenkel pair is\nobserved. Our results provide information about the advantages and limits of\nthe machine learned MD simulations with respect to the standard ones.

This\npaper extends the approach of Nunes and Vanderbilt (NV) [Phys. Rev.

We show that because non-orthogonal\ngeneralized Wannier functions can be more localized than their orthogonal\ncounterparts, the error due to localization constraints is reduced, thus\nimproving the accuracy of the calculated physical quantities.",

Distortions arising from these\namplitudes are then supplemented with non-singular displacements to enforce\nmechanical equilibrium. This allows for the consistent separation of plastic\nand elastic time scales in this framework. A finite element method is\nintroduced to solve the combined amplitude and elasticity equations, which is\napplied to a few prototypical configurations in two spatial dimensions for a\ncrystal of triangular lattice symmetry: i) the stress field induced by an edge\ndislocation with an analysis of how the amplitude equation regularizes stresses\nnear the dislocation core, ii) the motion of a dislocation dipole as a result\nof its internal interaction, and iii) the shrinkage of a rotated grain.

    "summary": "The point of zero gradient of the electronic band structure--critical\npoint--generally induces the singularity in the density of states (DOS), but no\nisolated critical point yields strict divergence of the DOS in three\ndimensions, differently from the lower dimensional cases. In view of the band\nstructure as a smooth hypersurface on the reciprocal space, we discuss the\nminimal deformation of the band structure that yields non-divergent but large\nsharp DOS peaks in three dimensions. By \"pushing down\" the energy level at the\nsecond order saddle point (maximum), a continuous closed loop of saddle points\n(sphere of maxima) encircling the original position of the saddle point\n(maximum) emerges, with which the DOS peak is formed. Being high dimensional\nfeatures, the saddle loop and extremum shell thus formed are difficult to\nlocate with standard band structure analysis on linear ${\\bf k}$-point paths.\nThe Lifshitz transition occurring over a linear or planar manifold is discussed\nas an indicator of such features. We also find that the celebrated DOS peak in\nthe recently discovered superconducting hydride H$_{3}$S originates from the\nsaddle loop. On this basis, we successfully extract the minimal model that\nexplains how the DOS peak is formed. Our theory characterizes a large class of\nDOS peaks sometimes found in the three dimensional electronic structures,\nbuilding a basis for profound understanding of their origins.",

    "summary": "Generative models have achieved impressive results in many domains including\nimage and text generation. In the natural sciences, generative models have led\nto rapid progress in automated drug discovery. Many of the current methods\nfocus on either 1-D or 2-D representations of typically small, drug-like\nmolecules. However, many molecules require 3-D descriptors and exceed the\nchemical complexity of commonly used dataset. We present a method to encode and\ndecode the position of atoms in 3-D molecules from a dataset of nearly 50,000\nstable crystal unit cells that vary from containing 1 to over 100 atoms. We\nconstruct a smooth and continuous 3-D density representation of each crystal\nbased on the positions of different atoms. Two different neural networks were\ntrained on a dataset of over 120,000 three-dimensional samples of single and\nrepeating crystal structures, made by rotating the single unit cells. The\nfirst, an Encoder-Decoder pair, constructs a compressed latent space\nrepresentation of each molecule and then decodes this description into an\naccurate reconstruction of the input. The second network segments the resulting\noutput into atoms and assigns each atom an atomic number. By generating\ncompressed, continuous latent spaces representations of molecules we are able\nto decode random samples, interpolate between two molecules, and alter known\nmolecules.",

    "summary": "Single-layer superconductors are ideal materials for fabricating\nsuperconducting nano devices. However, up to date, very few single-layer\nelemental superconductors have been predicted and especially no one has been\nsuccessfully synthesized yet. Here, using crystal structure search techniques\nand ab initio calculations, we predict that a single-layer planar carbon sheet\nwith 4- and 8-membered rings called T-graphene is a new intrinsic elemental\nsuperconductor with superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to around 20.8\nK. More importantly, we propose a synthesis route to obtain such a single-layer\nT-graphene, that is, a T-graphene potassium intercalation compound (C4K with\nP4/mmm symmetry) is firstly synthesized at high pressure (>11.5GPa) and then\nquenched to ambient condition; and finally, the single-layer T-graphene can be\neither exfoliated using the electrochemical method from the bulk C4K, or peeled\noff from bulk T-graphite C4, where C4 can be obtained from C4K by evaporating\nthe K atoms. Interestingly, we find that the calculated Tc of C4K is about\n30.4K at 0GPa, which sets a new record for layered carbon-based\nsuperconductors. The present findings add a new class of carbon based\nsuperconductors. In particular, once the single-layer T-graphene is\nsynthesized, it can pave the way for fabricating superconducting devices\ntogether with other 2D materials using the layer-by-layer growth techniques.",

A routine operation in such calculations is the evaluation\nof integrals over the Brillouin zone. We have previously demonstrated that\nperforming such integrals using generalized Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids can\nroughly double the speed of these calculations relative to the widely-used\ntraditional Monkhorst-Pack grids, and such grids can be rapidly generated by\nquerying a free, internet-accessible database of pre-generated grids. To\nfacilitate the widespread use of generalized k-point grids, we present new\nalgorithms that allow rapid generation of optimized generalized Monkhorst-Pack\ngrids on the fly, an open-source library to facilitate their integration into\nexternal software packages, and an open-source implementation of the database\ntool that can be used offline. We also present benchmarks of the speed of our\nalgorithms on structures randomly selected from the Inorganic Crystal Structure\nDatabase. For grids that correspond to a real-space supercell with at least 50\nangstroms between lattice points, which is sufficient to converge density\nfunctional theory calculations within 1 meV/atom for nearly all materials, our\nalgorithm finds optimized grids in an average of 0.19 seconds on a single\nprocessing core. For 100 angstroms between real-space lattice points, our\nalgorithm finds optimal grids in less than 5 seconds on average.",

    "summary": "Heat conduction in dielectric crystals originates from the propagation of\natomic vibrations, whose microscopic dynamics is well described by the\nlinearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Recently, it was shown that\nthermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a closed form as a sum over\nrelaxons, $\\mathit{i.e.}$ collective phonon excitations that are the\neigenvectors of Boltzmann equation's scattering matrix [Cepellotti and Marzari,\nPRX $\\mathbf{6}$ (2016)]. Relaxons have a well-defined parity, and only odd\nrelaxons contribute to the thermal conductivity. Here, we show that the\ncomplementary set of even relaxons determines another quantity --- the thermal\nviscosity --- that enters into the description of heat transport, and is\nespecially relevant in the hydrodynamic regime, where dissipation of crystal\nmomentum by Umklapp scattering phases out. We also show how the thermal\nconductivity and viscosity parametrize two novel viscous heat equations --- two\ncoupled equations for the temperature and drift-velocity fields --- which\nrepresent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations of\nhydrodynamics in the linear, laminar regime. These viscous heat equations are\nderived from a coarse-graining of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation\nfor phonons, and encompass both limits of Fourier's law and of second sound,\ntaking place, respectively, in the regimes of strong or weak momentum\ndissipation. Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation number as a descriptor\nthat captures the deviations from Fourier's law due to hydrodynamic effects. We\nshowcase these findings in a test case of a complex-shaped device made of\ngraphite, obtaining a remarkable agreement with the very recent experimental\ndemonstration of hydrodynamic transport in this material. The present findings\nalso suggest that hydrodynamic behavior can appear at room temperature in\nmicrometer-sized diamond crystals.",

Second, when used to assist high-throughput search\nfor materials in the ThCr2Si2 structure-type, iCGCNN exhibited a success rate\nof 31% which is 310 times higher than an undirected high-throughput search and\n2.4 times higher than that of the original CGCNN. Using both CGCNN and iCGCNN,\nwe screened 132,600 compounds with elemental decorations of the ThCr2Si2\nprototype crystal structure and identified a total of 97 new unique stable\ncompounds by performing 757 DFT calculations, accelerating the computational\ntime of the high-throughput search by a factor of 130. Our results suggest that\nthe iCGCNN can be used to accelerate high-throughput discoveries of new\nmaterials by quickly and accurately identifying crystalline compounds with\nproperties of interest.",

First, we implement a\ngroup-theoretical approach to construct the order N Taylor series of a\nd-dimensional crystal purely in terms of space group irreducible derivatives\n(ID), which guarantees symmetry by construction and allows for a practical\nmeans of communicating and storing phonons and their interactions. Second, we\nprove that the smallest possible supercell which accommodates N given\nwavevectors in a d-dimensional crystal is determined using the Smith Normal\nForm of the matrix formed from the corresponding wavevectors; resulting in\nnegligible computational cost to find said supercell, in addition to providing\nthe maximum required multiplicity for uniform supercells at arbitrary N and d.\nThird, we develop a series of finite displacement methodologies to compute\nphonons and their interactions which exploit the first two developments: lone\nand bundled irreducible derivative (LID and BID) approaches. LID computes a\nsingle ID, or as few as possible, at a time in the smallest supercell possible,\nwhile BID exploits perturbative derivatives for some order less than N (e.g.\nHellman-Feynman forces) in order to extract all ID in the smallest possible\nsupercells using the fewest possible computations. Finally, we derive an\nequation for the order N-2 volume derivatives of the phonons in terms of the\norder N ID. Given that the former are easily computed, they can be used as a\nstringent, infinite ranged test of the ID. Our general framework is illustrated\non graphene, yielding irreducible phonon interactions to fifth order.\nAdditionally, we provide a cost analysis for the rock-salt structure at N=3,\ndemonstrating a massive speedup compared to popular finite displacement methods\nin the literature.",

    "summary": "Trigonal selenium and tellurium crystalize in helical chain-like structures\nand thus possess interesting properties such as current-induced spin\npolarization, gyrotropic effects and nonlinear optical responses. By performing\nsystematic ab initio calculations based on density functional theory in the\ngeneralized gradient approximation plus scissors correction, we study their\nlinear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We find that the two materials\nexhibit significant second-harmonic generation (SHG) and linear electro-optic\n(LEO) effect. In particular, the SHG coefficients of tellurium are huge in the\nphoton energy range of 0 ~ 3 eV, with the magnitudes of SHG(xxx) being as large\nas 3640 pm/V, which are about sixteen times larger than that of GaN, a widely\nused NLO material. On the other hand, trigonal selenium is found to possesses\nlarge LEO coefficients r(xxx,0) which are more than six times larger than that\nof GaN.Therefore, trigonal tellurium and selenium may find valuable\napplications in NLO and LEO devices such as frequency conversion,\nelectro-optical switch and light signal modulator.The energy positions and\nshapes of the principal features in the calculated optical dielectric functions\nof both materials agree rather well with the available experimental ones, and\nare also analyzed in terms of the calculated band structures especially\nsymmetries of the involved band states and dipole transition selection rules.",

For modeling these coupled processes with the finite\nelement method, accurate descriptions of both the mechanical and the thermal\nresponses of the material, as well as their interaction, are needed.\nConventional material modeling employs empirical macroscopic constitutive\nrelations but does not account for the actual thermo-mechanical mechanisms\noccurring at the microscopic level. However, the consideration of the latter\nmight be crucial to obtain accurate predictions and a complete understanding of\nthe underlying physics. In this work we describe a fully coupled implicit\nthermo-mechanical framework for crystal plasticity simulations. This framework\nincludes thermal strains, temperature dependency of the crystal behavior and\nheat generation by dissipation due to plastic slip and allows the use of large\ndeformation steps thanks to the implicit integration of the governing\nequations. Its use within computational homogenization simulations allows to\nbridge the plastic deformation and temperature gradients at the macroscopic\nscale with the microscopic slip at the grain scale. A series of numerical\nexamples are presented to validate the approach.",

Our GTO-based\nmethod treats one-, two-, and three-dimensional periodic systems on an equal\nfooting, and allows for a seamless transition to the methodology commonly used\nin studies of molecules with heavy elements. The scalar relativistic effects\nand spin-orbit interaction are handled variationally. The full description of\nthe electron-nuclear potential in the core region of heavy nuclei is\nstraightforward due to the local nature of the GTOs and does not pose any\ncomputational difficulties. We show how the time-reversal symmetry and a\nquaternion algebra-based formalism can be exploited to significantly reduce the\nincreased methodological complexity and computational cost associated with\nmultiple wave-function components coupled by the spin-orbit interaction. We\nprovide a description of how to employ the matrix form of the multipole\nexpansion and an iterative renormalization procedure to evaluate the\nconditionally convergent lattice sums arising for periodic systems. We\ninvestigate the problem of inverse variational collapse that arises if the\nDirac operator containing a repulsive periodic potential is expressed in a\nbasis containing diffuse functions, and suggest a possible solution. We\ndemonstrate the validity of the method on silver halide crystals with large\nrelativistic effects, and two-dimensional honeycomb structures (silicene and\ngermanene) exhibiting the spin-orbit-driven quantum spin Hall effect. Our\nresults are well-converged with respect to the basis limit using standard bases\ndeveloped for molecular calculations, and indicate that the rule of removing\nbasis functions with small exponents should not be applied when transferring\nthe molecular basis to solids.",

Since the MLIP requires the highest accuracy among\nmachine learning estimations of the structure-property relationship, the\nenumeration of rotational invariants is useful for constructing MLIPs with the\ndesired accuracy. In this study, we introduce high-order linearly independent\nrotational invariants up to the sixth order based on spherical harmonics and\napply them to linearized MLIPs for elemental aluminum. A set of rotational\ninvariants is derived by the general process of reducing the Kronecker products\nof irreducible representations (Irreps) for the SO(3) group using a\ngroup-theoretical projector method.

It discovers a new way of describing multiscale\nheterogeneous materials by a multi-layer network structure and mechanistic\nbuilding blocks. The data-driven framework of DMN is discussed in detail about\nthe offline training and online extrapolation stages. Analytical solutions of\nthe 3D building block with a two-layer structure in both small- and\nfinite-strain formulations are derived based on interfacial equilibrium\nconditions and kinematic constraints. With linear elastic data generated by\ndirect numerical simulations on a representative volume element (RVE), the\nnetwork can be effectively trained in the offline stage using stochastic\ngradient descent and advanced model compression algorithms. Efficiency and\naccuracy of DMN on addressing the long-standing 3D RVE challenges with complex\nmorphologies and material laws are validated through numerical experiments,\nincluding 1) hyperelastic particle-reinforced rubber composite with Mullins\neffect; 2) polycrystalline materials with rate-dependent crystal plasticity; 3)\ncarbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with fiber anisotropic\nelasticity and matrix plasticity. In particular, we demonstrate a three-scale\nhomogenization procedure of CFRP system by concatenating the microscale and\nmesoscale material networks.

Most research on ice nucleation (and crystallization\nin general) has focused on understanding the former with less attention paid to\nthe latter. However, supercooled water exhibits fascinating and complex\ndynamical behavior, most notably dynamical heterogeneity (DH), a phenomenon\nwhere spatially separated domains of relatively mobile and immobile particles\ncoexist. Strikingly, the microscopic connection between the DH of water and the\nnucleation of ice has yet to be unraveled directly at the molecular level. Here\nwe tackle this issue via computer simulations which reveal that: (i) ice\nnucleation occurs in low-mobility regions of the liquid; (ii) there is a\ndynamical incubation period in which the mobility of the molecules drops prior\nto any ice-like ordering; and (iii) ice-like clusters cause arrested dynamics\nin surrounding water molecules. With this we establish a clear connection\nbetween dynamics and nucleation. We anticipate that our findings will pave the\nway for the examination of the role of dynamical heterogeneities in\nheterogeneous and solution-based nucleation.",

    "summary": "A computational method is developed for the study of mechanical response and\nfracture behavior of phase field crystals (PFC), to overcome a limitation of\nthe PFC dynamics which lacks an effective mechanism for describing fast\nmechanical relaxation of the material system. The method is based on a simple\ninterpolation scheme for PFC (IPFC) making use of a condition of the\ndisplacement field to satisfy local elastic equilibration, while preserving key\ncharacteristics of the original PFC model. We conduct a systematic study on the\nmechanical properties of a sample nanoribbon system with honeycomb lattice\nsymmetry subjected to uniaxial tension, for numerical validation of the IPFC\nscheme and the comparison with the original PFC and modified PFC methods.\nResults of mechanical response, in both elasticity and fracture regimes, show\nthe advantage and efficiency of the IPFC method across different system sizes\nand applied strain rates, due to its effective process of mechanical\nequilibration. A brittle fracture behavior is obtained in IPFC calculations,\nwhere effects of system temperature and chirality on the fracture strength and\nYoung's modulus are also identified, with results agreeing with those found in\nprevious atomistic simulations of graphene. The IPFC scheme developed here is\ngeneric and applicable to the mechanical studies using different types of PFC\nfree energy functionals designed for various material systems.",

    "summary": "Developing accurate, transferable and computationally inexpensive machine\nlearning models can rapidly accelerate the discovery and development of new\nmaterials. Some of the major challenges involved in developing such models are,\n(i) limited availability of materials data as compared to other fields, (ii)\nlack of universal descriptor of materials to predict its various properties.\nThe limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer\nlearning, while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and\nGrossman [1], where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network\n(CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals. In this work, we\ndevelop a new model (MT-CGCNN) by integrating CGCNN with transfer learning\nbased on multi-task (MT) learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-CGCNN\nby simultaneous prediction of various material properties such as Formation\nEnergy, Band Gap and Fermi Energy for a wide range of inorganic crystals (46774\nmaterials). MT-CGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on\ncorrelated properties by upto 8%. The model prediction has lower test error\ncompared to CGCNN, even when the training data is reduced by 10%. We also\ndemonstrate our model's better performance through prediction of end user\nscenario related to metal/non-metal classification. These results encourage\nfurther development of machine learning approaches which leverage multi-task\nlearning to address the aforementioned challenges in the discovery of new\nmaterials. We make MT-CGCNN's source code available to encourage reproducible\nresearch.",

On the other hand, nucleation is a\nrare event that occurs in much longer timescales than those achievable by\nab-initio molecular dynamics. To address this problem, we train a deep neural\nnetwork potential based on a set of data generated by Metadynamics simulations\nusing a classical potential. We show how this is an effective way to collect\nall the relevant data for the process of interest. In order to drive\nefficiently the crystallization process, we introduce a new collective variable\nbased on the Debye structure factor. We are able to encode the long-range order\ninformation in a local variable which is better suited to describe the\nnucleation dynamics. The reference energies are then calculated using the SCAN\nexchange-correlation functional, which is able to get a better description of\nthe bonding complexity of the Si phase diagram. Finally, we recover the free\nenergy surface with a DFT accuracy, and we compute the thermodynamics\nproperties near the melting point, obtaining a good agreement with experimental\ndata. In addition, we study the early stages of the crystallization process,\nunveiling features of the nucleation mechanism.",

Our\nmain goal is to calculate spatial distribution of kinetic temperatures,\ncorresponding to degrees of freedom of the unit cell, at any moment in time. An\napproximate expression for the temperatures is derived from solution of lattice\ndynamics equations. It is shown that the temperatures are represented as a sum\nof two terms. The first term describes high-frequency oscillations of the\ntemperatures caused by local transition to thermal equilibrium at short times.\nThe second term describes slow changes of the temperature profile caused by\nballistic heat transport. It is shown, in particular, that local values of\ntemperatures, corresponding to degrees of freedom of the unit cell, are\ngenerally different even if their initial values are equal. Analytical findings\nare supported by results of numerical solution of lattice dynamics equations\nfor diatomic chain and graphene lattice.

The use of these\npowerful techniques leads to the generation of enormous amounts of data, which\nin turn calls for new techniques to efficiently explore and visualize the\nmaterials space to help identify underlying patterns. In this work, we develop\na unified framework to hierarchically visualize the compositional and\nstructural similarities between materials in an arbitrary material space with\nrepresentations learned from different layers of graph convolutional neural\nnetworks. We demonstrate the potential for such a visualization approach by\nshowing that patterns emerge automatically that reflect similarities at\ndifferent scales in three representative classes of materials: perovskites,\nelemental boron, and general inorganic crystals, covering material spaces of\ndifferent compositions, structures, and both. For perovskites, elemental\nsimilarities are learned that reflects multiple aspects of atom properties. For\nelemental boron, structural motifs emerge automatically showing characteristic\nboron local environments. For inorganic crystals, the similarity and stability\nof local coordination environments are shown combining different center and\nneighbor atoms. The method could help transition to a data-centered exploration\nof materials space in automated materials design.",

Two analysis\nstrategies have been explored; principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means\nclustering. The intensity at individual (binned) pixels on the detector were\nused as the variables defining the multidimensional space in which each pattern\nin the map generates a single discrete point. PCA analysis alone did not work\nwell but rotating factors to the VARIMAX solution did. K-means clustering also\nsuccessfully segmented the data but was computational more expensive. The\ncharacteristic patterns produced by either VARIMAX or k-means clustering\nenhance weak patterns, remove pattern overlap, and allow subtle effects from\npolarity to be distinguished. Combining multivariate statistical analysis (MSA)\napproaches with template matching to simulation libraries can significantly\nreduce computational demand as the number of patterns to be matched is\ndrastically reduced.

Moreover, we identify that the Hopf-chain networks exist in a family of\ncrystals Sc3XC (X = Al, Ga, In, Tl). The crystals are 3D triple-points metals,\nand transit to topological metals with Hopf-chain networks under strains. These\nnovel Hopf networks exhibit unique Landau levels and magneto-transport\nproperties.",

    "summary": "The full elasticity tensor for nano-crystalline copper is derived in\nmolecular simulations by performing numerical tests for a set of generated\nsamples of the polycrystalline material. The results are analysed with respect\nto the anisotropy degree of the overall stiffness tensor resulting from the\nlimited number of grain orientations and their spatial distribution. The\ndependence of the overall bulk and shear moduli of an isotropized polycrystal\non the average grain diameter is analysed. It is found that while the shear\nmodulus decreases with grain size, the bulk modulus shows negligible dependence\non the grain diameter and is close to the bulk modulus of a single crystal. A\nclosed-form mean-field model of effective elastic properties for a bulk\nnano-grained polycrystal with cubic grains, i.e. made of a material with cubic\nsymmetry, is formulated. In the model all parameters are based on the data for\na single crystal and on the averaged grain size without any need for additional\nfitting. It is shown that the proposed model provides predictions of\nsatisfactory qualitative and quantitative agreement with atomistic simulations.",

The technique is\nhighly automated and readily accessible in many laboratories. EBSD pattern\nindexing is conventionally performed with raw electron backscatter patterns\n(EBSPs). These patterns are software processed to locate the band centres (and\nsometimes edges) from which the crystallographic index of each band is\ndetermined. Once a consistent index for many bands are obtained, the crystal\norientation with respect to a reference sample & detector orientation can be\ndetermined and presented. Unfortunately, due to challenges related to crystal\nsymmetry, there are limited available pattern indexing approaches and this has\nlikely hampered open development of the technique. In this manuscript, we\npresent a new method of pattern indexing, based upon a method with which\nsatellites locate themselves in the night sky, and systematically demonstrate\nits effectiveness using dynamical simulations and real experimental patterns.\nThe benefit of releasing this new algorithm is demonstrated as we utilise this\nindexing process, together with dynamical solutions, to provide some of the\nfirst accuracy assessments of an indexing solution. In disclosing a new\nindexing algorithm, and software processing tool-kit, we hope this opens up\nEBSD developments to more users. The software code and example data is released\nalongside this article for 3rd party developments.",

    "summary": "Ionic liquids constrained at interfaces or restricted in subnanometric pores\nare increasingly employed in modern technologies, including energy\napplications. Understanding the details of their behavior in these conditions\nis therefore critical. By using molecular dynamics simulation, we clarify\ntheoretically and numerically the effect of confinement at the nanoscale on the\nstatic and dynamic properties of an ionic liquid. In particular, we focus on\nthe interplay among the size of the ions, the slit pore width, and the length\nscale associated to the long-range organization of polar and apolar domains\npresent in the bulk material. By modulating both the temperature and the extent\nof the confinement, we demonstrate the existence of a complex reentrant phase\nbehavior, including isotropic liquid and liquid-crystal-like phases with\ndifferent symmetries. We show how these changes impact the relative\norganization of the ions, with substantial modifications of the Coulombic\nordering, and their dynamical state. In this respect, we reveal a remarkable\ndecoupling of the dynamics of the counterions, pointing to very different roles\nplayed by these in charge transport under confinement. We finally discuss our\nfindings in connection with very recent experimental and theoretical work.",

But what happens, if\nthose barriers are low? As examples, we consider NiTi shape memory alloy\nexhibiting a large elastocaloric effect, and selected elemental solids. We\nsuggest a model for dynamically polymorphic solids, where multiple LPEMs are\nvisited by ergodic motion of a single atom.

Dispersion-inclusive density\nfunctional theory (DFT) is then used for the Harris density without performing\na self-consistency cycle. Genarris uses machine learning for clustering, based\non a relative coordinate descriptor (RCD) developed specifically for molecular\ncrystals, which is shown to be robust in identifying packing motif similarity.\nIn addition to random structure generation, Genarris offers three workflows\nbased on different sequences of successive clustering and selection steps: the\n\"Rigorous\" workflow is an exhaustive exploration of the potential energy\nlandscape, the \"Energy\" workflow produces a set of low energy structures, and\nthe \"Diverse\" workflow produces a maximally diverse set of structures. The\nlatter is recommended for generating initial populations for genetic\nalgorithms. Here, the implementation of Genarris is reported and its\napplication is demonstrated for three test cases.",

    "summary": "We describe strategies to estimate the upper limits of the efficiency of\nphoton energy harvesting via hot electron extraction from gapless absorbers.\nGapless materials such as noble metals can be used for harvesting the whole\nsolar spectrum, including visible and near-infrared light. The energy of\nphoto-generated non-equilibrium or hot charge carriers can be harvested before\nthey thermalize with the crystal lattice via the process of their internal\nphoto-emission (IPE) through the rectifying Schottky junction with a\nsemiconductor. However, the low efficiency and the high cost of noble metals\nnecessitates the search for cheaper abundant alternative materials, and we show\nhere that carbon can serve as a promising IPE material candidate. We compare\nthe upper limits of performance of IPE photon energy-harvesting platforms,\nwhich incorporate either gold or carbon as the photoactive material where hot\nelectrons are generated. Through a combination of density functional theory,\njoint electron density of states calculations, and Schottky diode efficiency\nmodeling, we show that the material electron band structure imposes a strict\nupper limit on the achievable efficiency of the IPE devices. Our calculations\nreveal that graphite is a good material candidate for the IPE absorber for\nharvesting visible and near-infrared photons. Graphite electron density of\nstates yields a sizeable population of hot electrons with energies high enough\nto be collected across the potential barrier. We also discuss the mechanisms\nthat prevent the IPE device efficiency from reaching the upper limits imposed\nby their material electron band structures. The proposed approach is general\nand allows for efficient pre-screening of materials for their potential use in\nIPE energy converters and photodetectors within application-specific spectral\nwindows.",

Here, we propose a class of systems made of real\natoms, namely, carbon atoms with realistic physical interactions (dubbed here\nas Kagome graphene/graphyne). Density functional theory calculations reveal\nthat these Kagome lattices offer a controllable way to realize robust flat\nbands sufficiently close to the Fermi level. Upon hole doping, they split into\nspin-polarized bands at different energies to result in a flat-band\nferromagnetism. At a half filling, this splitting reaches its highest level of\n768 meV. At smaller fillings, e.g., when {\\nu}=1/6, on the other hand, a Wigner\ncrystal spontaneously forms, where the electrons form closed loops localized on\nthe grid points of a regular triangular lattice. It breaks the translational\nsymmetry of the original Kagome lattice. We further show that the Kagome\nlattices exhibit good mechanical stabilities, based on which a possible route\nfor experimental realization of the Kagome graphene is also proposed.",

Data\nwhich c2x is capable of extracting from Castep's binary checkpoint files\ninclude charge densities, spin densities, wavefunctions, relaxed atomic\npositions, forces, the Fermi level, the total energy, and symmetry operations.\nIt can recreate .cell input files from checkpoint files. Volumetric data can be\noutput in formats usable by many common visualisation programs, and c2x will\nitself calculate integrals, expand data into supercells, and interpolate data\nvia combinations of Fourier and trilinear interpolation. It can extract data\nalong arbitrary lines (such as between atoms) as 1D output. C2x is able to\nconvert between several common formats for describing molecules and crystals,\nincluding the .cell format of Castep. It can construct supercells, reduce cells\nto their primitive form, and add specified k-point meshes. It uses the spglib\nlibrary to report symmetry information, which it can add to .cell files. C2x is\na command-line utility, so is readily included in scripts. It is available\nunder the GPL and can be obtained from http://www.c2x.org.uk. It is believed to\nbe the only open-source code which can read Castep's .check files, so it will\nhave utility in other projects.",

    "summary": "Digital image correlation (DIC) is a well-established, non-invasive technique\nfor tracking and quantifying the deformation of mechanical samples under\nstrain. While it provides an obvious way to observe incremental and aggregate\ndisplacement information, it seems likely that DIC data sets, which after all\nreflect the spatially-resolved response of a microstructure to loads, contain\nmuch richer information than has generally been extracted from them. In this\npaper, we demonstrate a machine-learning approach to quantifying the prior\ndeformation history of a crystalline sample based on its response to a\nsubsequent DIC test. This prior deformation history is encoded in the\nmicrostructure through the inhomogeneity of the dislocation microstructure, and\nin the spatial correlations of the dislocation patterns, which mediate the\nsystem's response to the DIC test load. Our domain consists of deformed\ncrystalline thin films generated by a discrete dislocation plasticity\nsimulation. We explore the range of applicability of machine learning (ML) for\ntypical experimental protocols, and as a function of possible size effects and\nstochasticity. Plasticity size effects may directly influence the data,\nrendering unsupervised techniques unable to distinguish different plasticity\nregimes.",

To treat off-diagonal elements\ncorrectly based on Bayesian probability theory, the entropy term has to be\nextended for spectral functions that are possibly negative in some frequency\nranges. In that way, all matrix elements of the Green's function matrix can be\nanalytically continued; we introduce a computationally cheap element-wise\nmethod for this purpose. However, this method cannot ensure important\nconstraints on the mathematical properties of the resulting spectral functions,\nnamely positive semidefiniteness and Hermiticity. To improve on this, we\npresent a full matrix formalism, where all matrix elements are treated\nsimultaneously. We show the capabilities of these methods using insulating and\nmetallic dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) Green's functions as test cases.\nFinally, we apply the methods to realistic material calculations for LaTiO$_3$,\nwhere off-diagonal matrix elements in the Green's function appear due to the\ndistorted crystal structure.",

    "summary": "Phonon-mediated thermal conductivity, which is of great technological\nrelevance, fundamentally arises due to anharmonic scattering from interatomic\npotentials. Despite its prevalence, accurate first-principles calculations of\nthermal conductivity remain challenging, primarily due to the high\ncomputational cost of anharmonic interatomic force constant (IFCs)\ncalculations. Meanwhile, the related anharmonic phenomenon of thermal expansion\nis much more tractable, being computable from the Gr\\\"uneisen parameters\nassociated with phonon frequency shifts due to crystal deformations. In this\nwork, we propose a novel approach for computing the largest cubic IFCs from the\nGr\\\"uneisen parameter data. This allows an approximate determination of the\nthermal conductivity via a much less expensive route. The key insight is that\nalthough the Gr\\\"uneisen parameters cannot possibly contain all the information\non the cubic IFCs, being derivable from spatially uniform deformations, they\ncan still unambiguously and accurately determine the largest and most\nphysically relevant ones. By fitting the anisotropic Gr\\\"uneisen parameter data\nalong judiciously designed deformations, we can deduce (i.e., reverse engineer)\nthe dominant cubic IFCs and estimate three-phonon scattering amplitudes. We\nillustrate our approach by explicitly computing the largest cubic IFCs and\nthermal conductivity of graphene, especially for its out-of-plane (flexural)\nmodes that exhibit anomalously large anharmonic shifts and thermal conductivity\ncontributions. Our calculations on graphene not only exhibits reasonable\nagreement with established DFT results, but also presents a pedagogical\nopportunity for introducing an elegant analytic treatment of the Gr\\\"uneisen\nparameters of generic two-band models. Our approach can be readily extended to\nmore complicated crystalline materials with nontrivial anharmonic lattice\neffects.",

We show the usefulness of\nthis approach by studying the case of sodium and aluminum that crystallize in\nthe bcc and fcc crystalline structure, respectively.

Experimentally,\nsystems derived from the pentacene molecule have been shown to exhibit\nultrafast SF with high yields. Charge-transfer (CT) configurations are likely\nto play an important role as intermediates in the SF process in these systems.\nIn molecular crystals, electrostatic screening effects and band formation can\nbe significant in lowering the energy of CT states, enhancing their potential\nto effectively participate in SF. In order to simulate these, it desirable to\nadopt a computational approach which is acceptably accurate, relatively\ninexpensive, which and scales well to larger systems, thus enabling the study\nof screening effects. We propose a novel, electrostatically-corrected\nconstrained Density Functional Theory (cDFT) approach as a low-cost solution to\nthe calculation of CT energies in molecular crystals such as pentacene. Here we\nconsider an implementation in the context of the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT\ncode, but our electrostatic correction method is in principle applicable in\ncombination with any constrained DFT implementation, also outside the\nlinear-scaling framework.

Metastable\nmaterials represent a new frontier for studies, since even simple binary non\nground state compounds of common elements may be awaiting discovery. However,\nthere are significant research challenges related to non-equilibrium thin film\nsynthesis and crystal structure predictions, such as small strained crystals in\nthe experimental samples and energy minimization based theoretical algorithms.\nHere we report on experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as\ntheoretical first-principles calculations of a previously unreported\nmixed-valent binary tin nitride. Thin film experiments indicate that this novel\nmaterial is N-deficient SnN with tin in the mixed II/IV valence state and a\nsmall low-symmetry unit cell. Theoretical calculations suggest that the most\nlikely crystal structure has the space group 2 (SG2) related to the distorted\ndelafossite (SG166), which is nearly 0.1 eV/atom above the ground state SnN\npolymorph. This observation is rationalized by the structural similarity of the\nSnN distorted delafossite to the chemically related Sn3N4 spinel compound,\nwhich provides a fresh scientific insight into the reasons for growth of\npolymorphs of the metastable material. In addition to reporting on the\ndiscovery of the simple binary SnN compound, this paper illustrates a possible\nway of combining a wide range of advanced characterization techniques with the\nfirst-principle property calculation methods, to elucidate the most likely\ncrystal structure of the previously unreported metastable materials.",

As many\nproperties of such systems depend on the underlying ordering of their\nconstituent particles, understanding that structure is a primary objective of\ncondensed matter research. Although perfect crystals are fully described by a\nset of translation and basis vectors, real-world materials are never perfect,\nas thermal vibrations and defects introduce significant deviation from ideal\norder. Meanwhile, liquids and glasses present yet more complexity. A complete\nunderstanding of structure thus remains a central, open problem.

We explain the underlying reason why\nthis topological description of local structure is better suited for structural\nanalysis than continuous descriptions. We demonstrate the connection of this\napproach to the behavior of physical systems and explore how crystalline\nstructure is compromised at elevated temperatures.

We demonstrate\nthat the discontinuity at the cut-off distance in the first derivative of the\npotential (corresponding to the interparticle force) leads to the appearance of\ncut-off nonlinearities. These cut-off nonlinearities persist into the\nvery-low-temperature regime thereby affecting low-temperature thermal\nvibrations, which leads to a breakdown of the harmonic approximation for many\neigen modes, particularly for low-frequency vibrational modes. Furthermore,\nwhile expansion nonlinearities which are due to higher order terms in the\nTaylor expansion of the interaction potential are usually ignored at low\ntemperatures and show up as the temperature increases, cut-off nonlinearities\ncan become most significant at the lowest temperatures. Anharmonic effects\nreadily show up in the elastic moduli which not only depend on the eigen\nfrequencies, but are crucially sensitive to the eigen vectors of the normal\nmodes. Whereas, those observables that rely mainly on static structural\ninformation or just the eigen frequencies, such as the vibrational density of\nstates, total potential energy, and specific heat, show negligible dependence\non the presence of the cut-off. Similar aspects of nonlinear behavior have\nrecently been reported in model granular materials, where the constituent\nparticles interact through finite-range, purely-repulsive potentials. These\nnonlinearities have been ascribed to the nature of the sudden cut-off at\ncontact in the force-law, thus we demonstrate that cut-off nonlinearities\nemerge as a general feature of ordered and disordered solid state systems\ninteracting through truncated potentials.",

Using density functional theory,\nwe show that single-layer chromium trihalides (SLCTs) (CrX$_3$,X=F, Cl, Br and\nI) constitute a series of stable 2D intrinsic FM semiconductors. A\nfree-standing SLCT can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal, due to a low\ncleavage energy and a high in-plane stiffness. Electronic structure\ncalculations using the HSE06 functional indicate that both bulk and\nsingle-layer CrX$_3$ are half semiconductors with indirect gaps and their\nvalence bands and conduction bands are fully spin-polarized in the same spin\ndirection. The energy gaps and absorption edges of CrBr$_3$ and CrI$_3$ are\nfound to be in the visible frequency range, which implies possible\nopt-electronic applications. Furthermore, SLCTs are found to possess a large\nmagnetic moment of 3$\\mu_B$ per formula unit and a sizable magnetic anisotropy\nenergy. The magnetic exchange constants of SLCTs are then extracted using the\nHeisenberg spin Hamiltonian and the microscopic origins of the various exchange\ninteractions are analyzed. A competition between a near 90$^\\circ$ FM\nsuperexchange and a direct antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange results in a FM\nnearest-neighbour exchange interaction. The next and third nearest-neighbour\nexchange interactions are found to be FM and AFM respectively and this can be\nunderstood by the angle-dependent extended Cr-X-X-Cr superexchange interaction.\nMoreover, the Curie temperatures of SLCTs are also predicted using Monte Carlo\nsimulations and the values can further increase by applying a biaxial tensile\nstrain. The unique combination of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism, half\nsemiconductivity and large magnetic anisotropy energies renders the SLCTs as\npromising candidates for next-generation semiconductor spintronic applications.",

Based on a characterization of the local environment of\nall atoms in a cell we introduce crystal fingerprints that can be calculated\neasily and allow to define configurational distances between crystalline\nstructures that satisfy the mathematical properties of a metric. This distance\nbetween two configurations is a measure of their similarity/dissimilarity and\nit allows in particular to distinguish structures.

    "summary": "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of 58 liquid elements at their\ntriple point show that most metals exhibit near proportionality between thermal\nfluctuations between virial and potential-energy in the isochoric ensemble.\nThis demonstrates a general \"hidden\" scale invariance of metals making the\ndense part of the thermodynamic phase diagram effectively one dimensional with\nrespect to structure and dynamics. DFT computed density scaling exponents,\nrelated to the Gr{\\\"u}neisen parameter, are in good agreement with experimental\nvalues for 16 elements where reliable data were available. Hidden scale\ninvariance is demonstrated in detail for magnesium by showing invariance of\nstructure and dynamics. Computed melting curves of period three metals follow\ncurves with invariance (isomorphs). The experimental structure factor of\nmagnesium is predicted by assuming scale invariant inverse power-law (IPL) pair\ninteractions. However, crystal packings of several transition metals (V, Cr,\nMn, Fe, Nb, Mo, Ta, W and Hg), most post-transition metals (Ga, In, Sn, and Tl)\nand the metalloids Si and Ge cannot be explained by the IPL assumption. Thus,\nhidden scale invariance can be present even when the IPL-approximation is\ninadequate. The virial-energy correlation coefficient of iron and phosphorous\nis shown to increase at elevated pressures. Finally, we discuss how scale\ninvariance explains the Gr{\\\"u}neisen equation of state and a number of\nwell-known empirical melting and freezing rules.",

These layered monochalcogenides\nappear in four major polytypes depending on the stacking order, except for the\nmonoclinic GaTe. Bulk and few-layer $\\epsilon$- and $\\gamma$-type, and\nodd-number $\\beta$-type GaS, GaSe, and InSe crystals are noncentrosymmetric.\nThe spin splittings of the UVB and the LCB near the $\\Gamma$-point in the\nBrillouin zone are finite, but still smaller than those in a zinc-blende\nsemiconductor such as GaAs. On the other hand, the spin splitting is zero in\ncentrosymmetric bulk and even-number few-layer $\\beta$-type GaS, GaSe, and\nInSe, owing to the constraint of spatial inversion symmetry. By contrast, GaTe\nexhibits zero spin splitting because it is centrosymmetric down to a single\nlayer. In these monochalcogenide semiconductors, the separation of the\nnon-degenerate conduction and valence bands from adjacent bands results in the\nsuppression of Elliot-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism. Therefore, the electron-\nand hole-spin relaxation times in these systems with zero or minimal spin\nsplittings are expected to exceed those in GaAs when the D'yakonov-Perel' spin\nrelaxation mechanism is also suppressed.",

    "summary": "A method is presented for generating a good initial guess of a transition\npath between given initial and final states of a system without evaluation of\nthe energy. An objective function surface is constructed using an interpolation\nof pairwise distances at each discretization point along the path and the\nnudged elastic band method then used to find an optimal path on this image\ndependent pair potential (IDPP) surface. This provides an initial path for the\nmore computationally intensive calculations of the true minimum energy path\nusing some method of choice for evaluating the energy and atomic forces, for\nexample by ab initio or density functional theory. The optimal path on the IDPP\nsurface is significantly closer to the true minimum energy path than a linear\ninterpolation of the Cartesian coordinates and, therefore, reduces the number\nof iterations needed to reach convergence and averts divergence in the\nelectronic structure calculations when atoms are brought too close to each\nother in the initial path. The method is illustrated with three examples: (1)\nrotation of a methyl group in an ethane molecule, (2) an exchange of atoms in\nan island on a crystal surface, and (3) an exchange of two Si-atoms in\namorphous silicon. In all three cases, the computational effort in finding the\nminimum energy path with DFT was reduced by a factor ranging from 50 % to an\norder of magnitude by using an IDPP path as the initial path. The time required\nfor parallel computations was reduced even more because of load imbalance when\nlinear interpolation of Cartesian coordinates was used.",

The\nmechanically stable range of fluorite structure of UO2, which dictates the\nmaximum possible pressure of relevant pseudo-phase transitions, gives rise to\ndefect formation energies that span a wide band and overlap with the existing\nexperimental estimates. We reveal that the knowledge about pseudo-phase\nboundaries can not only provide important information of energetics that is\nhelpful for reducing the scattering in current estimates, but also be valuable\nfor guiding theoretical assessments, even to validate or disprove a theory. In\norder to take defect interactions into account and to extrapolate the physical\nquantities at finite stoichiometry deviations to that near the stoichiometry,\nwe develop a general formalism to describe the thermodynamics of a defective\nsystem. We also show that it is possible to include interactions among defects\nin a simple expression of point defect model (PDM) by introducing an auxiliary\nconstant mean-field. This generalization of the simple PDM leads to great\nversatility that allows one to study nonlinear effects of stoichiometry\ndeviation on materials' behavior. It is a powerful tool to extract the defect\nenergetics from finite defect concentrations to the dilute limit. Besides\nthese, the full content of the theoretical formalism and some relevant and\ninteresting issues, including reentrant pseudo-transition, multi-defect\ncoexistence, charged defects, and possible consequence of instantaneous\ndefective response in a quantum crystal, are explored and discussed.",

    "summary": "A mathematical model of plastic deformation in face-centered cubic (FCC)\nmaterials based on a balance model taking into account fundamental properties\nof deformation defects of a crystal lattice was developed. This model is based\non a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) accounting for various\nmechanisms of generation and annihilation of deformation defects for different\nexternal conditions. In-house developed software, SPFCC (Slip Plasticity of\nFace-Centered Cubic), was employed to solve the system of ordinary differential\nequations. The implemented code solves efficiently the stiff ODE system and\nprovides a user-friendly interface for investigation of various features of\nplastic deformation in FCC materials. Simulation of plastic deformation in the\nFCC metals was performed for the case of constant strain rate. The modelling\nresults were validated by comparing experimental data and simulation results\n(stress-strain curves) and good agreement was obtained.",

    "summary": "Hybrid density functionals show great promise for chemically-accurate first\nprinciples calculations, but their high computational cost limits their\napplication in non-trivial studies, such as exploration of reaction pathways of\nadsorbents on periodic surfaces. One factor responsible for their increased\ncost is the dense Brillouin-zone sampling necessary to accurately resolve an\nintegrable singularity in the exact exchange energy. We analyze this\nsingularity within an intuitive formalism based on Wannier-function\nlocalization and analytically prove Wigner-Seitz truncation to be the ideal\nmethod for regularizing the Coulomb potential in the exchange kernel. We show\nthat this method is limited only by Brillouin-zone discretization errors in the\nKohn-Sham orbitals, and hence converges the exchange energy exponentially with\nthe number of k-points used to sample the Brillouin zone for all but\nzero-temperature metallic systems. To facilitate the implementation of this\nmethod, we develop a general construction for the plane-wave Coulomb kernel\ntruncated on the Wigner-Seitz cell in one, two or three lattice directions. We\ncompare several regularization methods for the exchange kernel in a variety of\nreal systems including low-symmetry crystals and low-dimensional materials. We\nfind that our Wigner-Seitz truncation systematically yields the best k-point\nconvergence for the exchange energy of all these systems and delivers an\naccuracy to hybrid functionals comparable to semi-local and screened-exchange\nfunctionals at identical k-point sets.",

    "summary": "The propagation of high-energy electrons in crystals is in general a\ncomplicated multiple scattering problem. However, along high-symmetry zone axes\nthe problem can be mapped to the time evolution of a two-dimensional (2D)\nmolecular system. Each projected atomic column can be approximated by the\npotential of a 2D screened hydrogenic atom. When two columns are in close\nproximity, their bound states overlap and form analogs to molecular orbitals.\nFor sub-angstrom electron beams, excitation of anti-symmetric orbitals can\nresult in the failure of the simple incoherent imaging approximation. As a\nresult, the standard resolution test and the one-to-one correspondence of\natomic positions of a crystal imaged along a zone-axis with closely spaced\nprojected columns (\"dumbbells\") can fail dramatically at finite and realistic\nsample thicknesses. This is demonstrated experimentally in high angle annular\ndark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF STEM) images of\n[211]-oriented Si showing an apparent inter-column spacing of 1.28(+-.09)\nAngstroms, over 64% larger than the actual 0.78 Angstrom spacing. Furthermore,\nthe apparent spacing can be tuned with sample thickness and probe size to\nproduce a larger, smaller, or even the actual spacing under conditions when the\npeaks of two adjacent Si columns should not even have been resolved given the\nelectron probe size.",

    "summary": "We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighbourhood\nenvironments, and analyse their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness\nand suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties\nthat such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are\ndifferentiability with respect to moving the atoms, and invariance to the basic\nsymmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of\natoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors\nthat initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach,\nin which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers\nare used to expand the atomic neighbourhood density function. Using the example\nsystem of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to\nbe carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbours\nincreases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of\nthe descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether\nnew approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), that sidesteps\nthese difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two\nneighbourhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the\ninvariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations\nby fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and\nthe bulk crystal.",

We formulate this for general Objective\nStructures and then apply it to study carbon nanotubes of various chiralities\nthat are subjected to axial elongation and torsional deformation. We compare\nthe phonon spectra computed in the Objective Framework with spectra computed\nfor armchair and zigzag nanotubes. We also demonstrate the approach by\ncomputing the Density of States.

Snow crystal structures result from\ndiffusion limited crystal growth in the presence of anisotropic surface energy\nand anisotropic attachment kinetics. It is by now well understood that the\nmorphological stability of ice crystals strongly depends on supersaturation,\ncrystal size and temperature. Until very recently it was very difficult to\nperform numerical simulations of this highly anisotropic crystal growth. In\nparticular, obtaining facet growth in combination with dendritic branching is a\nchallenging task. We present numerical simulations of snow crystal growth in\ntwo and three space dimensions using a new computational method recently\nintroduced by the authors. We present both qualitative and quantitative\ncomputations. In particular, a linear relationship between tip velocity and\nsupersaturation is observed. The computations also suggest that surface energy\neffects, although small, have a larger effect on crystal growth than previously\nexpected. We compute solid plates, solid prisms, hollow columns, needles,\ndendrites, capped columns and scrolls on plates. Although all these forms\nappear in nature, most of these forms are computed here for the first time in\nnumerical simulations for a continuum model.",

    "summary": "An enhanced static approximation for the electron self energy operator is\nproposed for efficient calculation of quasiparticle energies. Analysis of the\nstatic COHSEX approximation originally proposed by Hedin shows that most of the\nerror derives from the short wavelength contributions of the assumed adiabatic\naccumulation of the Coulomb-hole. A wavevector dependent correction factor can\nbe incorporated as the basis for a new static approximation. This factor can be\napproximated by a single scaling function, determined from the homogeneous\nelectron gas model. The local field effect in real materials is captured by a\nsimple ansatz based on symmetry consideration. As inherited from the COHSEX\napproximation, the new approximation presents a Hermitian self-energy operator\nand the summation over empty states is eliminated from the evaluation of the\nself energy operator. Tests were conducted comparing the new approximation to\nGW calculations for diverse materials ranging from crystals and nanotubes. The\naccuracy for the minimum gap is about 10% or better. Like in the COHSEX\napproximation, the occupied bandwidth is overestimated.",

    "summary": "In this report, we achieved total transmission and reflection in a slab of\nzero index materials with defect(s). By controlling the defect's radius and\ndielectric constant, we can obtain total transmission and reflection of EM\nwave. The zero index materials, in this report, stand for materials with\npermittivity and permeability which are simultaneously equal to zero or so\ncalled matched impedance zero index materials. Along with theoretical\ncalculations and simulation demonstrations, we also discuss about some possible\napplications for the proposed structure such as shielding or cloaking an object\nwithout restricting its view. We also suggest a way to control total\ntransmission and reflection actively by using tunable refractive index\nmaterials such as liquid crystal and BST. The physics behind those phenomena is\nattributed to intrinsic properties of zero index materials: constant field\ninside zero index slab.",

    "summary": "We study the linear and nonlinear optical properties of wurtzite GaN under\nc-axial stress field, using density functional theory calculations. The fully\nstructural optimization at each c-axial strain was performed. The calculated\ndielectric functions show that tensile c-axial strain effectively improves the\nlinear optical efficiency, especially for the band-edge transitions, and\nsignificantly increase the mobility of electrons in the conduction band.\nSecond-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities show that the tensile c-axial\nstrain will enhance the zero- and low-frequency nonlinear responses of GaN. The\nenhancement of the nonlinear optical property is explained by the reduction of\nthe polarization of wurtzite GaN under tensile c-axial strains. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a method for improving the electrical and optical\nproperties of the crystal through imposing appropriate stress on the high\nsymmetry crystalline directions.",

    ],
    "summary": "Free energy of crystal phases is commonly evaluated by thermodynamic\nintegration (TDI) along a reversible path that involves an external potential.\nA persistent problem in this method is that a significant hysteresis is\nobserved due to differences in the center of mass position of the crystal phase\nin the presence and absence of the external potential. To alleviate this\nhysteresis, a constraint on the translational degrees of freedom of the crystal\nphase is imposed along the path and subsequently a correction term is added to\nthe free energy to account for such a constraint. In this work, we propose a\nnew methodology termed as error-biased Bennett Acceptance ratio (EBAR) method\nthat effectively solves this problem without the need to impose any constraint.\nThis method is simple to implement as it does not require any modification to\nthe path or to the simulation code. We show the applicability of this method in\nthe computation of crystal-melt interfacial energy by cleaving wall method [J.\nChem. Phys., 118, 7651 (2003)] and bulk crystal-melt free energy difference by\nconstrained fluid $\\lambda$-integration method [J. Chem. Phys., 120, 2122\n(2004)] for a model potential of silicon.",

    ],
    "summary": "Reduced Bloch mode expansion is presented for fast periodic media band\nstructure calculations. The expansion employs a natural basis composed of a\nselected reduced set of Bloch eigenfunctions. The reduced basis is selected\nwithin the irreducible Brillouin zone at high symmetry points determined by the\nmedium's crystal structure and group theory (and possibly at additional related\npoints). At each of the reciprocal lattice selection points, a number of Bloch\neigenfunctions are selected up to the frequency range of interest for the band\nstructure calculations. Since it is common to initially discretize the periodic\nunit cell and solution field using some choice of basis, reduced Bloch mode\nexpansion is practically a secondary expansion that uses a selected set of\nBloch eigenvectors. Such expansion therefore keeps, and builds on, any\nfavorable attributes a primary expansion approach might exhibit. Being in line\nwith the well known concept of modal analysis, the proposed approach maintains\naccuracy while reducing the computation time by up to two orders of magnitudes\nor more depending on the size and extent of the calculations. Results are\npresented for phononic, photonic and electronic band structures.",

    ],
    "summary": "Over the last two decades, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has become\none of the most important ways to investigate the structure of crystal\nsurfaces. STM has helped achieve remarkable successes in surface science such\nas finding the atomic structure of Si(111) and Si(001). For high-index Si\nsurfaces the information about the local density of states obtained by scanning\ndoes not translate directly into knowledge about the positions of atoms at the\nsurface. A commonly accepted strategy for identifying the atomic structure is\nto propose several possible models and analyze their corresponding {\\em\nsimulated} STM images for a match with the experimental ones. However, the\nnumber of good candidates for the lowest-energy structure is very large for\nhigh-index surfaces, and heuristic approaches are not likely to cover all the\nrelevant structural models. In this article, we take the view that finding the\natomic structure of a surface is a problem of stochastic optimization, and we\naddress it as such. We design a general technique for predicting the\nreconstruction of silicon surfaces with arbitrary orientation, which is based\non parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations combined with an exponential\ncooling. The advantages of the method are illustrated using the Si(105) surface\nas example, with two main results: (a) the correct single-step rebonded\nstructure [e.g., Fujikawa {\\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 176101 (2002)] is\nobtained even when starting from the paired-dimer model [Mo {\\em et al.}, Phys.\nRev. Lett. 65, 1020 (1990)] that was assumed to be correct for many years, and\n(b) we have found several double-step reconstructions that have lower surface\nenergies than any previously proposed double-step models.",
