    "summary": "Novel materials drive progress across applications from energy storage to\nelectronics. Automated characterization of material structures with machine\nlearning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in\nmaterial design. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive language model\nthat performs crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data.\nThe presented model, deCIFer, generates crystal structures in the widely used\nCrystallographic Information File (CIF) format and can be conditioned on powder\nX-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on\nhigh-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use\ndiffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal\nstructures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing\nchallenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative\nassessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces\nstructures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably,\ndeCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental\ndiffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for\ncrystal structure characterization.",
