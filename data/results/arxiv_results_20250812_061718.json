    "summary": "Ionic mobility determines the rate performance of several applications, such\nas batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors and is exponentially\ndependent on the migration barrier ($E_m$), a difficult to measure/calculate\nquantity. Previous approaches to identify materials with high ionic mobility\nhave relied on imprecise descriptors given the lack of generalizable models to\npredict $E_m$. Here, we present a graph neural network based architecture that\nleverages principles of transfer learning to efficiently and accurately predict\n$E_m$ across a diverse set of materials. We use a model pre-trained\nsimultaneously on seven distinct bulk properties (labeled MPT), modify the MPT\nmodel to classify different migration pathways in a structure, and fine-tune\n(FT) on a manually-curated literature-derived dataset of 619 $E_m$ data points\ncalculated with density functional theory. Importantly, our best-performing FT\nmodel (labeled MODEL-3) demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction\naccuracy compared to classical machine learning methods, graph models trained\nfrom scratch, and a universal machine learned interatomic potential, with a\nR$^2$ score of 0.703 and a mean absolute error of 0.261 eV on the test set.\nNotably, MODEL-3 is able to distinguish different migration pathways within a\nstructure and also demonstrates excellent ability to generalize across\nintercalant compositions and chemistries. As a classifier, MODEL-3 exhibits\n80\\% accuracy and 82.8\\% precision in identifying materials that are `good'\nionic conductors (i.e., structures with $E_m <$0.65~eV). Thus, our work\ndemonstrates the effective use of FT strategies and architectural modifications\nnecessary for making swift and accurate $E_m$ predictions, which will be useful\nfor materials discovery in batteries and for predicting other data-scarce\nmaterial properties.",
