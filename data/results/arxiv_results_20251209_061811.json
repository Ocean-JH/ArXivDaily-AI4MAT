    "summary": "The observation of reversible de-mixing phenomena in mixed-halide perovskites under illumination is one of the most challenging as well as intriguing aspects of this class of materials. On the one hand, it poses critical constraints to the compositional space that allows reliable design of absorbers for perovskite photovoltaics. On the other hand, it holds potential for the development of novel optoionic devices where an ionic response is triggered via optical stimuli. Funda-mental questions about the origin of such photo de-mixing process remain unanswered, both in terms of its mechanism as well as thermodynamic description. Here, we relate in-situ measurements of ionic and electronic transport of mixed bromide-iodide perovskite thin films performed during photo de-mixing with the evolution of their optical and morpho-logical properties. The results point to the definition of different stages of the de-mixing process which, based on micros-copy and spectroscopic measurements, we assign to regimes of spinodal decomposition and nucleation of quasi-equilibrium iodide- and bromide-rich phases. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we explore the role of dimensionality in the mechanism and reversibility of photo de-mixing and dark re-mixing processes, referring to elec-tronic and ionic contributions to the de-mixing driving force. Additionally, our data emphasizes the role of the surface, as significantly different de-mixing dynamics, in terms of extent and reversibility, are observed for films with or without encapsulation. Our comprehensive analysis of transport, phase and optical properties of mixed-halide perovskites pro-vides guidelines for future materials design as well as for the more general fundamental understanding of light-induced ionic phenomena.",

    "summary": "Additive manufacturing (AM) processes, particularly laser powder bed fusion, offer exceptional design flexibility but impose extreme thermal conditions that limit the processability of high strength aluminum alloys. This work develops an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) framework that combines physics informed machine learning (ML) with large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to enable inverse design of Al alloys with improved strength ductility synergy tailored for AM. A heterogeneous multi process database of about 1500 alloys, spanning laser based and solid state AM, cast, and wrought routes, was assembled with yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation as target properties. Composition derived and rule of mixtures descriptors created from elemental properties define a 46 dimensional, physically interpretable feature space. A Random Forest regressor provides strong performance for strength (R2 about 0.85) and competitive accuracy for ductility, while SHAP analysis highlights stacking fault energy, solute misfit, and thermophysical descriptors as dominant factors. Robustness tests using fractional unknown row validation and evaluation on recently reported 2024 2025 AM alloys confirm that the model generalizes across composition process space. A strength ductility quality index is then used to map design spaces in benchmark alloy families, including binary Al Cu, quaternary Al Zn Mg Cu, and the Al92(Ti,Fe,Co,Ni)2 family, consistently identifying narrow composition windows with high synergy. Large scale MD simulations of Al(Fe,Co,Ni,Ti) alloys with varying Al content reproduce an inverted U shaped dependence of strength and ductility with a maximum near Al88 to Al92, in close agreement with ML predictions. The results demonstrate a data driven, physics aware workflow for accelerating discovery of next generation aluminum alloys for AM.",

    "summary": "Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.",
