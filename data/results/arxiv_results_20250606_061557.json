    "summary": "Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical,\nchemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal\nconductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength.\nAlmost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is\noften inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the\nconsistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a\nsignificant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly\ntackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this\nby using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and\ndiscrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a\npermutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and\nan absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates\nWyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class\nsymmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive\nbias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material\nproperties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and\nexhibits unparalleled inference speed.",
