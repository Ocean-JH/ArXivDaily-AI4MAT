    "summary": "Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by\naccelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to\nmaterials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial\nhuman oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing\ndomain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge\nacross disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of\nmore general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a\ndomain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific\nworkflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript\npreparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological\nstudies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,\nexecuted one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed\nanalysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced\ncompleted manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific\ndiscovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning\nand methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with\nlimitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step\ntoward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,\naccelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space\nthat human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.\nIt raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and\nthe attribution of scientific credit.",

    "summary": "Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how\nmetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective\nintroduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative\napproaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new\nporous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing\ndeep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and\nlarge language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of\navailable data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials\ndesigns. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput\ncomputational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated,\nclosed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular\nchemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for\nhigh-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally,\nwe highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset\ndiversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.",
