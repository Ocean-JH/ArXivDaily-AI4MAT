    "summary": "Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of\namorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune\nfeatures of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to\nspecific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the\nstructure. This has been understood through the notion of independent\nbond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs\nhave different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated\ninverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified\nin a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse\ndesign. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the\nsimultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much\nstronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the\nmechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across\na wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable\nparameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our\nformulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter\nchanges, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability.\nThese results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference\nbetween ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to\nboth understand and perform inverse design.",
