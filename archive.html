    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing
crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns,
particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding
task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information,
multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to
potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease
humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven
Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust
identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara
performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within
a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld
refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering,
automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion,
peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When
ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided
between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing
the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable
analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for
integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully
self-driving materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We employ interpretable explicit machine learning to analyze the material
dependence of the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$ in ferromagnetic and
ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds. For around 200 compounds, we consider both
experimental $T_c$ and calculated $T_c$ using \textit{ab initio} determination
of magnetic interactions together with a Monte-Carlo solution. We use the
hierarchical dependence extraction (HDE) procedure [Mor\'ee and Arita, Phys.
Rev. B 110, 014502 (2024)] to extract the dependencies of $T_c$ on chemical
proportions and magnetic moments from the main order to the higher order, and
construct an explicit expression of $T_c$ from these dependencies. The main
results are: (a) $T_c$ is mainly controlled by the proportions of Fe, Co, and
Mn, and increases with these proportions, consistent with previous machine
learning analyses of ferromagnetic materials. (b) The HDE describes $T_c$ with
an accuracy that is comparable to that of other machine learning procedures.
(c) The HDE expression of $T_c$ can be interpreted as a generalized order
parameter that increases with increasing magnetization amplitude, in
qualitative agreement with various theories of phase transitions. These results
strengthen our understanding of the material dependence of $T_c$ in collinear
Heusler magnets and motivate the further use of HDE in material design.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing heterogeneous catalysis research
by accelerating simulations and materials discovery. A key frontier is
integrating AI with multiscale models and multimodal experiments to address the
"many-to-one" challenge of linking intrinsic kinetics to observables. Advances
in machine-learned force fields, microkinetics, and reactor modeling enable
rapid exploration of chemical spaces, while operando and transient data provide
unprecedented insight. Yet, inconsistent data quality and model complexity
limit mechanistic discovery. Generative and agentic AI can automate model
generation, quantify uncertainty, and couple theory with experiment, realizing
"self-driving models" that produce interpretable, reproducible, and
transferable understanding of catalytic systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials with a twist between layers exhibit a moir\'e
interference pattern with larger periodicity than any of the constituent layer
unit cells. In these systems, a wealth of exotic phases appear that result from
moir\'e-dependent many-body electron correlation effects or non-trivial band
topology. One problem with using twist to generate moir\'e interference has
been the difficulty in creating high-quality, uniform, and repeatable samples
due to fabrication through mechanical stacking with viscoelastic stamps. Here
we show, a new method to generate moir\'e interference through the controlled
application of layer-by-layer strain (heterostrain) on non-twisted 2D
materials, where moir\'e interference results from strain-induced lattice
mismatch without twisting or stacking. Heterostrain generation is achieved by
depositing stressed thin films onto 2D materials to apply large strains to the
top layers while leaving layers further down less strained. We achieve
deterministic control of moir\'e periodicity and symmetry in non-twisted 2D
multilayers and bilayers, with 97% yield, through varying stressor film force
(film thickness X film stress) and geometry. Moir\'e reconstruction effects are
memorized after the removal of the stressor layers. Control over the strain
degree-of-freedom opens the door to a completely unexplored set of unrealized
tunable moir\'e geometric symmetries, which may now be achieved in a high-yield
and user-skill independent process taking only hours. This technique solves a
long-standing throughput bottleneck in new moir\'e quantum materials discovery
and opens the door to industrially-compatible manufacturing for 2D
moir\'e-based electronic or optical devices.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Efficient exploration of the vast chemical space is a fundamental challenge
in materials discovery, particularly for designing functional inorganic
crystalline materials with targeted properties. Diffusion-based generative
models have emerged as a powerful route, but most existing approaches require
domain-specific constraints and separate diffusion processes for atom types,
atomic positions, and lattice parameters, adding complexity and limiting
efficiency. Here, we present DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based
diffusion model that generates complete crystal structures in a single,
end-to-end diffusion process. This unified framework simplifies the model
architecture and accelerates sampling by two to three orders of magnitude
compared to existing methods without compromising chemical and structural
diversity of the generated materials. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of
DiffCrysGen in generating valid and useful materials, using density functional
theory (DFT), we validate a number of newly generated rare earth-free magnetic
materials that are energetically and dynamically stable, and are potentially
synthesizable. These include ferromagnets with high saturation magnetization
and large magnetocrystalline anisotropy, as also metallic antiferromagnets.
These results establish DiffCrysGen as a general platform for accelerated
functional materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of
novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored
chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the
performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three
databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary
nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database
(constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally
perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are
less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions
involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we
assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in
performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is
attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we
refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future
developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the
limitations of diffusion models.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.</p>

    <p>Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accurate prediction of surface energies and stabilities is essential for
materials design, yet first-principles calculations remain computationally
expensive and most existing interatomic potentials are trained only on bulk
systems. Here, we demonstrate that fine-tuning foundation machine learning
potentials (MLPs) significantly improves both computational efficiency and
predictive accuracy for surface modeling. While existing universal interatomic
potentials (UIPs) have been solely trained and validated on bulk datasets, we
extend their applicability to complex and scientifically significant unary,
binary, and ternary surface systems. We systematically compare models trained
from scratch, zero-shot inference, conventional fine-tuning, and multi-head
fine-tuning approach that enhances transferability and mitigates catastrophic
forgetting. Fine-tuning consistently reduces prediction errors with
orders-of-magnitude fewer training configurations, and multi-head fine-tuning
delivers robust and generalizable predictions even for materials beyond the
initial training domain. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging
pre-trained MLPs to accelerate surface modeling and highlight a scalable path
toward data-efficient, next-generation atomic-scale simulations in
computational materials science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.</p>

    <p>The inverse design of materials with specific desired properties, such as
high-temperature superconductivity, represents a formidable challenge in
materials science due to the vastness of chemical and structural space. We
present a guided diffusion framework to accelerate the discovery of novel
superconductors. A DiffCSP foundation model is pretrained on the Alexandria
Database and fine-tuned on 7,183 superconductors with first principles derived
labels. Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which
lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines
machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess
stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with
DFT-calculated $T_\mathrm{c}>5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates
effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated
against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this
work, which highlighted challenges in sparsely charted chemistries. This
end-to-end workflow accelerates superconductor discovery while underscoring the
challenge of predicting and synthesizing experimentally realizable materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.</p>

    <p>Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias

Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving

guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent
space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data

across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned
equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based
MLIP models.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.</p>

    <p>Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide
materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics,
including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and
photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped
excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that
localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice
distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures
the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material
design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton
(STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the
interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light
emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality,
connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl
in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal
electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations,
such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice
dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without
compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion
mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for
tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with
enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.</p>

    <p>Scientific hypothesis generation is central to materials discovery, yet
current approaches often emphasize either conceptual (idea-to-data) reasoning
or data-driven (data-to-idea) analysis, rarely achieving an effective
integration of both. Here, we present a generalizable active learning workflow
that integrates top-down, theory-driven hypothesis generation, guided by a
large language model. This is complemented by bottom-up, data-driven hypothesis
testing through a root-cause association study. We demonstrate this approach
through the design of equimolar quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite, a
chemically complex system with over 850,000 possible cation combinations. In
the top-down component, the large language model drives closed-loop
optimization by proposing candidates that are likely to achieve phase purity,
leveraging domain knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning. With each
iteration, the model identifies an increasing number of near phase-pure
compositions, sampling less than 0.004% of the design space. In parallel, the
bottom-up association study identifies molecular features with statistically
significant influences on phase purity. The integration of these approaches
enables the convergence of conceptual and statistical hypotheses, leading to
generalizable and rational design rules for phase-pure quinary-cation
two-dimensional perovskites. As a proof of concept, we applied the optimized
phase-pure quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite film as a surface capping
layer in perovskite solar cells, achieving good performance and stability. Our
framework enables the development of interpretable and generalizable design
rules that are applicable to a wide range of optimization processes within
complex design spaces, providing a foundational strategy for rational,

    <p>The rational combination of existing magnetic topological compounds presents
a promising route for designing new topological materials. We report the
synthesis and comprehensive characterization of the layered quaternary
intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$, which combines structural units of
two known magnetic topological materials, EuCuAs and EuZn$_2$As$_2$.
Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with successive
magnetic transitions: quasi-two-dimensional ordering at $T_\mathrm{M} =
29.3$\,K, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 19$\,K, and
spin-reorientation at $T_\mathrm{SR} = 16.3$\,K. The stepwise magnetic
transitions manifest as plateau-like anomalies in the heat capacity. These
transitions originate from multiple superexchange pathways and periodic
variation of interplane Eu-Eu distances in the intergrowth structure. Charge
transport shows a pronounced resistivity increase above $T_\mathrm{N}$ followed
by minimal change below the ordering temperature. Magnetic fields rapidly
suppress this resistivity rise, yielding significant negative
magnetoresistance. Remarkably, Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ inherits the nonlinear
anomalous Hall effect characteristic of its parent compounds. Energy
evaluations of collinear spin configurations reveal a lowest-energy state with
ferromagnetic coupling between Eu planes in EuCuAs units while maintaining
antiferromagnetic coupling within EuZn$_2$As$_2$ units. The corresponding
electronic structure displays potentially topologically nontrivial features.
Our work demonstrates the efficacy of structural hybridization for discovering

high-intensity lasers to provide fast and efficient surface or volume

novel materials with desired functionalities, and upscaling laser technologies
with industry-demanded throughputs. Depending on the parameters, lasers can

from exploring the fundamental physics of warm dense matter and molecular

anti-bacterial, tribological, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic properties. The
objectives of this Chapter are to provide a review of recent advancements in
several laser application fields, which involve high-intensity lasers, both
ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) and short (nanosecond). After summarizing
general trends in high-intensity laser processing of materials, we will first
focus on the new opportunities offered by high-intensity lasers for the
controlled synthesis of multielement nanoparticles for catalytic and
theranostic applications. Then, the blister-based laser-induced forward

high-precision printing of nanomaterials on any substrates. The next section
will discuss the selective crystallization of amorphous (as prepared)
semiconductor nanoscale materials. The processes enabling high selectivity of
crystallization into the desired phase using ultrashort powerful lasers will be
analyzed. After that, opportunities for using high-power lasers will be
discussed for upscaling surface nanostructuring with high throughput for

    <p>Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism
that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization,
enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This
distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials
composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for
next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and
experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited
due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional
approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the
entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize
altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting
significant spin splitting ($\geq 50$ meV within $\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi

momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly
across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away
from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future
photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and
elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a
robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of high-performance materials is crucial for technological
advancement. Inverse design using multi-agent systems (MAS) shows great
potential for new material discovery. However, current MAS for materials
research rely on predefined configurations and tools, limiting their
adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we developed a
planner driven multi-agent system (S1-MatAgent) which adopts a Planner-Executor
architecture. Planner automatically decomposes complex materials design tasks,
dynamically configures various tools to generate dedicated Executor agents for
each subtask, significantly reducing reliance on manual workflow construction
and specialized configuration. Applied to high-entropy alloy catalysts for
hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions, S1-MatAgent completed
full-cycle closed-loop design from literature analysis and composition
recommendation to performance optimization and experimental validation. To
tackle the deviations between designed materials and target, as well as high
experimental verification costs, S1-MatAgent employs a novel composition
optimization algorithm based on gradients of machine learning interatomic
potential, achieving 27.7 % improvement in material performance. S1-MatAgent
designed 13 high-performance catalysts from 20 million candidates, with
Ni4Co4Cu1Mo3Ru4 exhibiting an overpotential of 18.6 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and
maintaining 97.5 % activity after 500 hours at 500 mA cm-2. The universal MAS
framework offers a universal and scalable solution for material discovery,
significantly improving design efficiency and adaptability.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Disordered (amorphous) materials, such as glasses, are emerging as promising
candidates for applications within energy storage, nonlinear optics, and
catalysis. Their lack of long-range order and complex short- and medium-range
orderings, which depend on composition as well as thermal and pressure history,
offer a vast materials design space. To this end, relying on machine learning
methods instead of trial and error is promising, and among these, inverse
design has emerged as a tool for discovering novel materials with desired
properties. Although inverse design methods based on diffusion models have
shown success for crystalline materials and molecules, similar methods
targeting amorphous materials remain less developed, mainly because of the
limited availability of large-scale datasets and the requirement for larger
simulation cells. In this work, we propose and validate an inverse design
method for amorphous materials, introducing AMDEN (Amorphous Material DEnoising
Network), a diffusion model-based framework that generates structures of
amorphous materials. These low-energy configurations are typically obtained
through a thermal motion-driven random search-like process that cannot be
replicated by standard denoising procedures. We therefore introduce an
energy-based AMDEN variant that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo refinement
for generating these relaxed structures. We further introduce several amorphous
material datasets with diverse properties and compositions to evaluate our
framework and support future development.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>High-pressure crystal structure prediction (CSP) underpins advances in
condensed matter physics, planetary science, and materials discovery. Yet, most
large atomistic models are trained on near-ambient, equilibrium data, leading
to degraded stress accuracy at tens to hundreds of gigapascals and sparse
coverage of pressure-stabilized stoichiometries and dense coordination motifs.
Here, we introduce OpenCSP, a machine learning framework for CSP tasks spanning
ambient to high-pressure conditions. This framework comprises an open-source
pressure-resolved dataset alongside a suite of publicly available atomistic
models that are jointly optimized for accuracy in energy, force, and stress
predictions. The dataset is constructed via randomized high-pressure sampling
and iteratively refined through an uncertainty-guided concurrent learning
strategy, which enriches underrepresented compression regimes while suppressing
redundant DFT labeling. Despite employing a training corpus one to two orders
of magnitude smaller than those of leading large models, OpenCSP achieves
comparable or superior performance in high-pressure enthalpy ranking and
stability prediction. Across benchmark CSP tasks spanning a wide pressure
window, our models match or surpass MACE-MPA-0, MatterSim v1 5M, and
GRACE-2L-OAM, with the largest gains observed at elevated pressures. These
results demonstrate that targeted, pressure-aware data acquisition coupled with
scalable architectures enables data-efficient, high-fidelity CSP, paving the
way for autonomous materials discovery under ambient and extreme conditions.</p>

    <p>Donor-acceptor (D:A) cocrystals offer a promising platform for
next-generation optoelectronic applications, but the impact of residual solvent
molecules on their properties remains an open question. We investigate six
novel D:A cocrystals of dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and
1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbo-nitrile (HATCN), prepared via solvent
evaporation, yielding 1:1 molar ratios, and horizontal vapor deposition,
resulting in solvent-free 3:2 cocrystals. Combining spectroscopy and
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that, while the
electronic and optical properties of the cocrystals are largely unaffected by
solvent inclusion, the charge transfer mechanism is surprisingly complex. Raman
spectroscopy reveals a consistent charge transfer of 0.11 $e$ across all
considered structures, corroborated by DFT calculations on solvent-free
systems. Partial charge analysis reveals that in solvated cocrystals, solvent
molecules actively participate in the charge transfer process as primary
electron acceptors. This involvement can perturb the expected D:A behavior,
revealing a faceted charge-transfer mechanism in HATCN even beyond the
established involvement of its cyano group. Overall, our study demonstrates
that while solution-based methods preserve the intrinsic D:A characteristics,
solvents can be leveraged as active electronic components, opening new avenues

    <p>Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,

materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization

first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization

    <p>Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of
first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict
energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face
computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode
geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation,
rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet
maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified,
and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders.
We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed
through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include
replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances
with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory
demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node
information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster
than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the
MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under
10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as
fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by
over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster
training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially
reshaping computational materials discovery.</p>

    <p>Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such

materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted

    <p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific
problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but
instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of

this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and
property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our
crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a
compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves
computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors.
Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer
which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding
symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards
desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than

    <p>Diffractive neural networks leverage the high-dimensional characteristics of
electromagnetic (EM) fields for high-throughput computing. However, the
existing architectures face challenges in integrating large-scale
multidimensional metasurfaces with precise network training and haven't
utilized multidimensional EM field coding scheme for super-resolution sensing.
Here, we propose diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) for accurate EM field
modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and
coding for multi-task learning and high-throughput super-resolution direction
of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to
characterize the amplitude and phase responses of meta-atoms across different
polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters inversely designed
using the gradient-based meta-training. For wide-field super-resolution angle
estimation, the system simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles
through x and y-polarization channels, while the interleaving of
frequency-multiplexed angular intervals generates spectral-encoded optical
super-oscillations to achieve full-angle high-resolution estimation.
Post-processing lightweight electronic neural networks further enhance the
performance. Experimental results validate that a three-layer DMNN operating at
27 GHz, 29 GHz, and 31 GHz achieves $\sim7\times$ Rayleigh diffraction-limited
angular resolution (0.5$^\circ$), a mean absolute error of 0.048$^\circ$ for
two incoherent targets within a $\pm 11.5^\circ$ field of view, and an angular
estimation throughput an order of magnitude higher (1917) than that of existing
methods. The proposed architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing
systems by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods
for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling
automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly,
slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address
this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral
fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity.
Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and
charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic
algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively
selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with
processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property
relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To
improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add
domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to
retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated
under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature
stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built
from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%)
by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert
features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance,
highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover
known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a
tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping.
This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly
features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly
properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES,
Raman, FTIR).</p>

    <p>Graph Neural Networks have rapidly advanced in materials science and

This study compares physics-based site feature calculators with data-driven

strategies, when integrated into the DenseGNN model,significantly outperform
state-of-the-art models across 35 datasets from Matbench and JARVIS-DFT,
yielding predictions with accuracy close to that of DFT calculations.
Furthermore, applying a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy substantially

    <p>Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding

models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density
$w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a

available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we
systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using

    <p>Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding
challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property
relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable
models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density
$w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a
minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated
dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed
Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from
available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we
systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using
combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final
closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive
accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while
maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design

    <p>Crystalline structure prediction is an essential prerequisite for designing
materials with targeted properties. Yet, it is still an open challenge in
materials design and drug discovery. Despite recent advances in computational
materials science, accurately predicting three-dimensional non-polymeric
crystal structures remains elusive. In this work, we focus on the molecular
assembly problem, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is
packed to form a crystalline structure. Such a simplified formulation provides
a useful approximation to the actual problem. However, while recent
state-of-the-art methods have increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques,
the underlying learning objective remains ill-posed. We propose a better
formulation that introduces a loss function capturing key geometric molecular
properties while ensuring permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that within this framework, a simple regression
model already outperforms prior approaches, including flow matching techniques,
on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated non-polymeric subset of the
Crystallography Open Database (COD).</p>

    <p>Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material
property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed
configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a
prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear
deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable
aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a
generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large,
nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates
the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric
descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based
representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these
configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and
postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation
setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and
higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce
diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when
inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while
accommodating complex constraints.</p>

    <p>Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how

introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative
approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new
porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing
deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and
large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of
available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials
designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput
computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated,
closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular
chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for
high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally,
we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset

    <p>Crystal structure determination from powder diffraction patterns is a complex

from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. By capturing the intricate relationships

and accurate inverse design. Trained on thousands of atomic structures and
their simulated XRD patterns from the JARVIS-DFT dataset, we evaluate the model
across three scenarios: (1) without chemical information, (2) with a list of
elements, and (3) with an explicit chemical formula. The results demonstrate
that incorporating chemical information significantly enhances prediction
accuracy. Additionally, the training process is straightforward and fast,
bridging gaps between computational, data science, and experimental

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation
temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge
in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework
based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design
of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property
prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to
directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that
satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally
validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs.
Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a
high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work
output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal
hysteresis of 29 {\deg}C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced
performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a
finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf
diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This
study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable
route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
knowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel
materials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world
applications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and
experiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space,
minimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide
an accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the
integration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials
structures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge
from literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG
in accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic
review to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key
materials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal
structure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining,
database integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining
LLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the
performance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline
future directions for leveraging LLMs to accelerate materials research and
discovery for advancement in technologies in the area of electronics, optics,
biomedical, and energy storage.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Weaving as an old craft has extensive applications in modern science and
technology such as smart textiles and intelligent soft robots. However, weaving
irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring
curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple
strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags',
a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of
straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the
fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these
local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric
frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar & hinge model to simulate the
mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how
the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's
modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where
an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag
patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces
including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows,
respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave
the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft
robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Ionic mobility determines the rate performance of several applications, such
as batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors and is exponentially
dependent on the migration barrier ($E_m$), a difficult to measure/calculate
quantity. Previous approaches to identify materials with high ionic mobility
have relied on imprecise descriptors given the lack of generalizable models to
predict $E_m$. Here, we present a graph neural network based architecture that
leverages principles of transfer learning to efficiently and accurately predict
$E_m$ across a diverse set of materials. We use a model pre-trained
simultaneously on seven distinct bulk properties (labeled MPT), modify the MPT
model to classify different migration pathways in a structure, and fine-tune
(FT) on a manually-curated literature-derived dataset of 619 $E_m$ data points
calculated with density functional theory. Importantly, our best-performing FT
model (labeled MODEL-3) demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy compared to classical machine learning methods, graph models trained
from scratch, and a universal machine learned interatomic potential, with a
R$^2$ score of 0.703 and a mean absolute error of 0.261 eV on the test set.
Notably, MODEL-3 is able to distinguish different migration pathways within a
structure and also demonstrates excellent ability to generalize across
intercalant compositions and chemistries. As a classifier, MODEL-3 exhibits
80\% accuracy and 82.8\% precision in identifying materials that are `good'
ionic conductors (i.e., structures with $E_m <$0.65~eV). Thus, our work
demonstrates the effective use of FT strategies and architectural modifications
necessary for making swift and accurate $E_m$ predictions, which will be useful
for materials discovery in batteries and for predicting other data-scarce
material properties.</p>

    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling
new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their
application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly
multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present
a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature
from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and
materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials.
We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and
Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and
adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model
(BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a
Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and
translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference
protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query,
surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach
through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,
and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the
fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and
measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived
adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive

    <p>Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials
design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet
they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into
their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system
capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle,
from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We
introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic
materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and
executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results,
and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives.
SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research
gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps,
including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization,
embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is
evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and
perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of
SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the
user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter
consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific
rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world
design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate
SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically

combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method

    <p>Diffusion-based deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for

chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to
chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator

transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced

valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence
checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When
fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability
and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of
functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal
conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as
a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative
pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative models are revolutionizing materials discovery by enabling inverse
design-direct generation of structures from desired properties. However,
existing approaches often struggle to ensure inherent stability and symmetry
while precisely generating structures with target compositions, space groups,
and lattices without fine-tuning. Here, we present SSAGEN (Stability and
Symmetry-Assured GENerative framework), which overcomes these limitations by
decoupling structure generation into two distinct stages: crystal information
(lattice, composition, and space group) generation and coordinate optimization.
SSAGEN first generates diverse yet physically plausible crystal information,
then derives stable and metastable atomic positions through universal machine
learning potentials, combined global and local optimization with symmetry and
Wyckoff position constraints, and dynamically refined search spaces. Compared
to prior generative models such as CDVAE, SSAGEN improves the thermodynamic and
kinetic stability of generated structures by 148% and 180%, respectively, while
inherently satisfying target compositions, space groups, and lattices. Applied
to photocatalytic water splitting (PWS), SSAGEN generates 200,000
structures-81.2% novel-with 3,318 meeting all stability and band gap criteria.
Density functional theory (DFT) validation confirms 95.6% structures satisfy
PWS requirements, with 24 optimal candidates identified through comprehensive
screening based on electronic structure, thermodynamic, kinetic, and aqueous
stability criteria. SSAGEN not only precisely generates materials with desired
crystal information but also ensures inherent stability and symmetry,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted inverse design of functional
materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Developing efficient and universal polymer crosslinking strategies is pivotal
for advanced material design, especially for challenging matrixes like
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Traditional crosslinkers such as
divinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are
limited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast,
bis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing
thermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly
selective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory
(DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We
demonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy
barriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts
and with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length. Moreover, BD exhibits
selective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS,
respectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB,
especially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of
magnitude faster. Our findings provide atomistic insights into BD crosslinker
reactivity and establish a mechanistic foundation for next-generation,
universal C-H activation-based crosslinking technologies.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative machine learning models have revolutionized material discovery by
capturing complex structure-property relationships, yet extending these
approaches to the inverse design of three-dimensional metamaterials remains
limited by computational complexity and underexplored design spaces due to the
lack of expressive representations. Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative
framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language
representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact,
unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct
application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion
models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain
responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while
addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions.
Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical
objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains.
Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy
of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with
tailored properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation
techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of
training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To
address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for
Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for
DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent
with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic
DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error
handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their
discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS
capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average
errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we
apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating
its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again
reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally,
DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian
ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at
the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS
approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design
space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and
intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput,
high-fidelity computational materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials
discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental
platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the
features used to model system performance, compromising current and future
campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect
noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and
finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then
performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value
distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy
features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are
conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity
noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean
training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with
continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability
compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic
study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data
recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature
distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in
materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and
experimental precision in automated materials discovery.</p>

    <p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer unprecedented compositional flexibility for
designing advanced materials, yet predicting their crystallographic phases
remains a key bottleneck due to limited data and complex phase formation
behavior. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced machine learning framework that
leverages quantum annealing to enhance phase classification in HEAs. Our
pipeline integrates Quantum Boosting (QBoost) for interpretable feature
selection and classification, with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) that
use quantum-enhanced kernels to capture nonlinear relationships between
physical descriptors. By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling
capabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust
generalization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical
baselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves,
Heusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both
cross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally
synthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and
measured phases. Our findings demonstrate that quantum-enhanced classifiers
match or exceed classical models in accuracy and offer insights grounded in
interpretable physical descriptors. This work constitutes an important step

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recently, radical progress in machine learning (ML) has revolutionized
computational materials science, enabling unprecedentedly rapid materials
discovery and property prediction, but the quantum many-body problem -- which
is the key to understanding excited-state properties, ranging from transport to
optics -- remains challenging due to the complexity of the nonlocal and
energy-dependent interactions. Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free,
transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire
many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention
mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field
states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in
predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE)
formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton
oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is
trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute
error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and
exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that
the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body
correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states
to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a
foundation model for computational materials science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The synthesis of complex natural products remains one of the grand challenges
of organic chemistry. We present DeepRetro, a major advancement in
computational retrosynthesis that enables the discovery of viable synthetic
routes for complex molecules typically considered beyond the reach of existing
retrosynthetic methods. DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that
tightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic
engines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior
approaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs.
In contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with
the generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity
checks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically
explores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and
expert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro
achieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true
strength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly
complex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated
planning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach
enables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine
collaboration in organic chemistry. Beyond retrosynthesis, DeepRetro represents
a working model for how to leverage LLMs in scientific discovery. We provide a
transparent account of the system's design, algorithms, and human-feedback
loop, enabling broad adaptation across scientific domains. By releasing
DeepRetro as an open-source tool, we aim to empower chemists to tackle
increasingly ambitious synthetic targets, accelerating progress in drug

    <p>Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and

simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation
allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to
uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures.
Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and

computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous

first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust
adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B
model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens

    <p>Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems
remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and
electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of
next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is
proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic
properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic
moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike
previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds,
the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable,
binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the
Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and
advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix
sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic
ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes,
addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic
moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's
matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately
estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic
behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient
framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic
materials with tailored properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular
property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to
effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as
molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely
limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily
focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods
often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,
while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module
leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)
rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational
invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment
strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.
Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior
predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to
existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational
complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for
efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery
and material design.</p>

    <p>Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing
parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in
materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited
training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To
overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling
approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art
text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method
introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing
temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,
enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and
capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity
and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the
model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently
transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism
using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16
encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean
IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical
descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and
real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path
errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the
first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,
offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Magnetism, a fundamental concept predating condensed matter physics, has
achieved significant advancements in recent decades, driven by its potential
for next-generation storage devices. Meanwhile, the classification of magnetic
orders, even for the most fundamental concepts like ferromagnetism (FM) and
antiferromagnetism (AFM), has encountered unprecedented challenges since the
discovery of unconventional magnets and advancements in antiferromagnetic
spintronics. Here, we present a rigorous classification of magnetic order using
state-of-the-art spin space group (SSG) theory. Based on whether the net
magnetic moment is constrained to zero by SSG, magnetic order is unambiguously
dichotomized into FM (including ferrimagnetism) and AFM. Additionally, we
classify AFM geometries into four categories -- primary, bi-color, spiral, and
multi-axial -- based on periodic spin propagation beyond the symmetry
operations of magnetic space groups. We then introduce a distinct magnetic
phase, dubbed spin-orbit magnetism, characterized by its unique behavior
involving the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) order parameter and SOC-driven phase
transition. We further create an oriented SSG description, i.e., SSG with a
fixed magnetic configuration, apply the framework to 2,065 experimentally
validated magnetic materials in MAGNDATA database, and identify over 220
spin-orbit magnets with distinct spin and orbital magnetization mechanisms.
Implemented by the online program FINDSPINGROUP, our work establishes a
universal symmetry standard for magnetic order classification, offering new
understandings of unconventional magnets and broad applicability in spintronics
and quantum material design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The development of machine-learning models for atomic-scale simulations has
benefited tremendously from the large databases of materials and molecular
properties computed in the past two decades using electronic-structure
calculations. More recently, these databases have made it possible to train
universal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic
geometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was
however in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted
primarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the
most accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation
details to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed
specifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable
predictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different
philosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the
dataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively
distorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability
of the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other
hand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most
accurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort.
The MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures,
has already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that
are competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three
orders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and
details of the construction of the MAD dataset. We also introduce a
low-dimensional structural latent space that allows us to compare it with other
popular datasets and that can be used as a general-purpose materials
cartography tool.</p>

    <p>Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.</p>

    <p>The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission

challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single
day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor
control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,
and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed
structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,
and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research
strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage
exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully
identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.
However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel
materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and
domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes
resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a
complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The
workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through
rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need
for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized

    <p>Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and
functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often
well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always
consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by
major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving
insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems,
benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient
and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new
APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics
for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation.
Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the
impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization.
Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML
researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel
solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for
instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced
benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth

    <p>In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction
approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally
expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum
mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative
models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more
rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and
periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling
structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a
symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment
Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these
limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on
an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning
structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known
low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the
ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy
for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as
metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction
approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally
expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum
mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative
models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more
rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and
periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling
structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a
symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment
Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these
limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on
an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning
structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known
low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the
ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy
for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as
metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Studying the peeling behaviour of adhesives on skin is vital for advancing
biomedical applications such as medical adhesives and transdermal patches.
Traditional methods like experimental testing and finite element method (FEM),
though considered gold standards, are resource-intensive, computationally
expensive and time-consuming, particularly when analysing a wide material
parameter space. In this study, we present a neural network-based approach to
predict the minimum peel force (F_min) required for adhesive detachment from
skin tissue, limiting the need for repeated FEM simulations and significantly
reducing the computational cost. Leveraging a dataset generated from FEM
simulations of 90 degree peel test with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics
parameters, our neural network model achieved high accuracy, validated through
rigorous 5-fold cross-validation. The final architecture was able to predict a
wide variety of skin-adhesive peeling behaviour, exhibiting a mean squared
error (MSE) of 3.66*10^-7 and a R^2 score of 0.94 on test set, demonstrating
robust performance. This work introduces a reliable, computationally efficient
method for predicting adhesive behaviour, significantly reducing simulation
time while maintaining accuracy. This integration of machine learning with
high-fidelity biomechanical simulations enables efficient design and
optimization of skin-adhesive systems, providing a scalable framework for
future research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive material
design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accurate characterization of temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties
(TEPs), such as thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, is essential
for reliable modeling and efficient design of thermoelectric devices. However,
their nonlinear temperature dependence and coupled transport behavior make both
forward simulation and inverse identification difficult, particularly under
sparse measurement conditions. In this study, we develop a physics-informed
machine learning approach that employs physics-informed neural networks (PINN)
for solving forward and inverse problems in thermoelectric systems, and neural
operators (PINO) to enable generalization across diverse material systems. The
PINN enables field reconstruction and material property inference by embedding
governing transport equations into the loss function, while the PINO
generalizes this inference capability across diverse materials without
retraining. Trained on simulated data for 20 p-type materials and evaluated on
60 unseen materials, the PINO model demonstrates accurate and label-free
inference of TEPs using only sparse field data. The proposed framework offers a
scalable, generalizable, and data-efficient approach for thermoelectric
property identification, paving the way for high-throughput screening and
inverse design of advanced thermoelectric materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that manipulate
electromagnetic waves, having optical properties absent in natural materials.
Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn
attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial
structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses
challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex
metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements
customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many
metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our
method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse
range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers
valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of
the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental
fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form
metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage
applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.</p>

    <p>We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific
properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the
immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional
computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density
functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at
scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging
data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of
MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates
both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To
address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced,
transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our
approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both
connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline
comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid
sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a
reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via
property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into
sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable,
topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work
demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with
reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and
unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.</p>

Finally, we explore how large language models emerge as interactive design

    <p>HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based

design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological
optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE)
and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by
generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs.
Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters,
produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a
compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize
geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused
for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition
function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB
systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer
electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the
total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude,
accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its
efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green,
and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while
mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing
demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust,
multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation
nanophotonic challenges.</p>

generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs.
Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters,
produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a
compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize
geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused
for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition
function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB
systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer
electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the
total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude,
accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its
efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green,
and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while
mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing
demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust,
multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation
nanophotonic challenges.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials are the foundation of modern society, underpinning advancements in
energy, electronics, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure. The
ability to discover and design new materials with tailored properties is
critical to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. In recent
years, the growing availability of high-quality materials data combined with
rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for
accelerating materials discovery. Data-driven generative models provide a
powerful tool for materials design by directly create novel materials that
satisfy predefined property requirements. Despite the proliferation of related
work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this
area. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent
progress in AI-driven materials generation. We first organize various types of
materials and illustrate multiple representations of crystalline materials. We
then provide a detailed summary and taxonomy of current AI-driven materials
generation approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the common evaluation metrics
and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude
with potential future directions and challenges in this fast-growing field. The

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven
approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant
experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in
empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to
erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently
by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective
re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical
effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset
containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass
transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density
($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance
improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net,
SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method
reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy
with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the
dataset to be re-measured. These findings highlight the importance of data
quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in
polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive
reliability in materials science.</p>

    <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science
questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials

computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can
be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the
proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the
generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based
computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two
complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA)
benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated
methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use
examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials
Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the
ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world
benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of
functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of
diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine
specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a
standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for
materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific
properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis,
energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion
principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance
constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process.
However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures
often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel
inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is
based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize
the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired
performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the
InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96%
improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models.
Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of
low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate
materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously
expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative
model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove
the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors
under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we
successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor
with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides
strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials
science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the
challenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid
organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their
exceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric
deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong
potential in predicting material properties and guiding material design.
However, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and
higher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes
(QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material
property prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex,
which encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying
dimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our
model leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them
using a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark
datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP
datasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in
HOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex
representation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for
predictive modeling of perovskite materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has
revolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often
struggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized
through kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between
theoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a
synthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure
derivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the
efficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable
structures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based
synthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized
structures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab
initio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The
framework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn,
Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting
synthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the
554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising
synthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X =
Ti, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$
candidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for
experimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally
observed temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a
data-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials

    <p>Microstructure often dictates materials performance, yet it is rarely treated
as an explicit design variable because microstructure is hard to quantify,

framework that makes microstructural morphology into a controllable objective
and demonstrate its use case with Li- and Mn-rich layered oxide cathode
precursors. This work presents an integrated, AI driven framework for the
predictive design and optimization of lithium-ion battery cathode precursor
synthesis. This framework integrates a diffusion-based image generation model,
a quantitative image analysis pipeline, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm. By extracting key morphological descriptors such as texture,
sphericity, and median particle size (D50) from SEM images, the platform
accurately predicts SEM like morphologies resulting from specific
coprecipitation conditions, including reaction time-, solution concentration-,
and pH-dependent structural changes. Optimization then pinpoints synthesis
parameters that yield user defined target morphologies, as experimentally
validated by the close agreement between predicted and synthesized structures.
This framework offers a practical strategy for data driven materials design,
enabling both forward prediction and inverse design of synthesis conditions and
paving the way toward autonomous, image guided microstructure engineering.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials
discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials
with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for
crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to
separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These
methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising,
which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we
introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that
jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline
materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices,
DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules,
enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and
lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic
symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it
to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied
DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high
saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable,
diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.</p>

    <p>Inverse electromagnetic modeling has emerged as a powerful approach for
designing complex microwave structures with high accuracy and efficiency. In
this study, we propose an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net) for
the inverse design of Ku-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) components
based on multimode resonators. We use a multimode resonance structure to
demonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure.
Therefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart
filter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual
neural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design
techniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved
generalization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to
generate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy
inspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network
(HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate
that the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy
compared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical
metrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements. To validate
the proposed framework, we first design and fabricate a three-resonance SIW
structure. Next, we apply the trained IRC-Net model to predict the geometry of
a four-resonance structure based on its desired frequency response. Both
designs are fabricated and tested, showing strong agreement between the
simulated, predicted, and measured results, confirming the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.</p>

    <p>Liquid crystal polymers with exceptional optical properties are highly
promising for next-generation virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR)
technologies, serving as high-performance, compact, lightweight, and
cost-effective optical components. However, the growing demands for optical
transparency and high refractive index in advanced optical devices present a
challenge for material discovery. In this study, we develop a novel approach
that integrates first-principles calculations with genetic algorithms to
accelerate the discovery of liquid crystal polymers with low visible absorption
and high refractive index. By iterating within a predefined space of molecular
building blocks, our approach rapidly identifies reactive mesogens that meet
target specifications. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into the
relationships between molecular structure and properties. This strategy not
only accelerates material screening but also uncovers key molecular design
principles, offering a systematic and scalable alternative to traditional
trial-and-error methods.</p>

    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping many aspects of materials science
and chemistry research, enabling advances in molecular property prediction,
materials design, scientific automation, knowledge extraction, and more. Recent
developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate
structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and
streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities
across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total
projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for
Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These
projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property
prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel
interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data
management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7)
knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature.
Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile
predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools,
and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary
LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data,
and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data
environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their
integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new
challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further
research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, generative models have been
increasingly employed in the exploration of novel materials. By integrating
traditional computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT)
and molecular dynamics (MD), existing generative models, including diffusion
models and autoregressive models, have demonstrated remarkable potential in the
discovery of novel materials. However, their efficiency in goal-directed
materials design remains suboptimal. In this work we developed a highly
transferable, efficient and robust conditional generation framework, PODGen, by
integrating a general generative model with multiple property prediction
models. Based on PODGen, we designed a workflow for the high-throughput
crystals conditional generation which is used to search new topological
insulators (TIs). Our results show that the success rate of generating TIs
using our framework is 5.3 times higher than that of the unconstrained
approach. More importantly, while general methods rarely produce gapped TIs,
our framework succeeds consistently, highlighting an effectively $\infty$
improvement. This demonstrates that conditional generation significantly
enhances the efficiency of targeted material discovery. Using this method, we
generated tens of thousands of new topological materials and conducted further
first-principles calculations on those with promising application potential.
Furthermore, we identified promising, synthesizable topological (crystalline)
insulators such as CsHgSb, NaLaB$_{12}$, Bi$_4$Sb$_2$Se$_3$, Be$_3$Ta$_2$Si and
Be$_2$W.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic
surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them
promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices.
Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion
via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC
often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design
strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin
Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in
an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that
while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant
SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial
topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a
delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron
tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the
bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an
external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of
controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further
validate this interplay, by revealing g-factor suppression and the emergence a
zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a
robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway
for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems
using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.</p>

    <p>Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for generating lasers via second harmonic

novel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming

Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties.
Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD)

developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical
responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a
tolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5.

    <p>Chemomechanical interactions in gas or liquid environments are crucial for
the functionality and longevity of various materials used in sustainable energy
technologies, such as rechargeable batteries, water-splitting catalysts, and
next-generation nuclear reactors. A comprehensive understanding of nanoscale
strain evolution involved in these processes can advance our knowledge of
underlying mechanisms and facilitate material design improvements. However,
traditional microscopy workflows face challenges due to trade-offs between
field of view (FOV), spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and electron beam
damage, particularly in gas or liquid environments. Here, we demonstrate in
situ nanometer-resolution strain and orientation mapping in a
temperature-controlled gas environment with a large FOV. This is achieved by
integrating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based closed-cell TEM
holder, precession-assisted four-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM), and a direct electron detector (DED). Using the strain
evolution during zirconium initial oxidation as a case study, we first outline
critical strategies for focused ion beam gas-cell sample preparation and
gas-phase TEM workflows to enhance experimental success. We then show that
integrating DED with precession electron diffraction and optimizing gas
pressure substantially improve the quantity and quality of the detected Bragg
peaks in nano-beam electron diffraction patterns, enabling more precise strain
measurements. Furthermore, we introduce a practical protocol to pause the
reactions, allowing sufficient time for 4D-STEM data collection while ensuring
the temporal resolution needed to resolve material dynamics. Our methodology

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with
complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material
failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in
two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the
prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical
engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are
limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep
learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions.
Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven
supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints,
which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed
a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed
Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution
material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the
microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive
prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed
Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By
introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not
require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of
stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress
concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress
analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states
through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction
framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.</p>

    <p>Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and
performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in
materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in
two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often
associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key
locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering
applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data
and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for
deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress
fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In
this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and
spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we
introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress
Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data.
This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically
investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy.
Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal
super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed
Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning
method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights
on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based
constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during
training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to
arbitrary magnifications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage
systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and
ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However,
measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain
experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a
unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a
forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both
computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive
molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately
estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation
structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance
and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration,
making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular
mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the
first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design,
demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports
multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently
multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we
experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic
conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework
advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other
complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the
vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication
constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human
intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often
involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning
strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To
overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided
framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling
process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion
network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During
inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject
this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative
process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional
post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design
problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such
as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders
of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning
approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization
schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a
streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for
next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.</p>

    <p>Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs)
are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery
highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials,
particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations
of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on
the generation of new topological materials through a generative model.
Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained
generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material
design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's
ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of
the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a
large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a
representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the
largest known in this category.</p>

    <p>Efficient energy storage systems are crucial to address the intermittency of
renewable energy sources. As multivalent batteries, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs),
while inherently low voltage, offer a promising low cost alternative to Li-ion
batteries due to viable use of zinc as the anode. However, to maximize the
potential impact of ZIBs, rechargable cathodes with improved Zn diffusion are
needed. To better understand the chemical and structural factors influencing
Zn-ion mobility within battery electrode materials, we employ a high-throughput
computational screening approach to systematically evaluate candidate
intercalation hosts for ZIB cathodes, expanding the chemical search space on
empty intercalation hosts that do not contain Zn. We leverage a high-throughput
screening funnel to identify promising cathodes in ZIBs, integrating screening
criteria with DFT-based calculations of Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation and diffusion
inside the host materials. Using this data, we identify the design principles
that favor Zn-ion mobility in candidate cathode materials. Building on previous
work on divalent ion cathodes, this study broadens the chemical space for
next-generation multivalent energy storage systems.</p>

as the conditional generative model, experiments on two data-scarce material

synthetic data has potential in extreme data-scarce scenarios, achieving
performance close to or exceeding that of real samples in all two tasks. We
also find that pseudo-labels have little impact on generated data quality.

integrates automated hypothesis generation with experimental validation in a

demonstrates higher materials exploration rate and property value while
providing transparent reasoning pathways. This approach develops an

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The electronic structure of a material fundamentally determines its
underlying physical, and by extension, its functional properties. Consequently,
the ability to identify or generate materials with desired electronic
properties would enable the design of tailored functional materials.
Traditional approaches relying on human intuition or exhaustive computational
screening of known materials remain inefficient and resource-prohibitive for
this task. Here, we introduce DOSMatGen, the first instance of a machine
learning method which generates crystal structures that match a given desired
electronic density of states. DOSMatGen is an E(3)-equivariant joint diffusion
framework, and utilizes classifier-free guidance to accurately condition the
generated materials on the density of states. Our experiments find this
approach can successfully yield materials which are both stable and match
closely with the desired density of states. Furthermore, this method is highly
flexible and allows for finely controlled generation which can target specific
templates or even individual sites within a material. This method enables a
more physics-driven approach to designing new materials for applications
including catalysts, photovoltaics, and superconductors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Despite rapid growth in use cases for generative artificial intelligence, its
ability to design purpose built crystalline materials remains in a nascent
phase. At the moment inverse design is generally accomplished by either
constraining the training data set or producing a vast number of samples from a
generator network and constraining the output via post-processing. We show that
a general adversarial network trained to produce crystal structures from a
latent space can be fine tuned through the introduction of advanced graph
neural networks as discriminators, including a universal force field, to
intrinsically bias the network towards generation of target materials. This is
exemplified utilizing two-dimensional topological insulators as a sample target
space. While a number of two-dimensional topological insulators have been
predicted, the size of the band-gap, a measure of topological protection,
remains a concern in most candidate compounds. The resulting generative network
is shown to yield novel topological insulators.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>With the advent of large language models (LLMs), the vast unstructured text
within millions of academic papers is increasingly accessible for materials
discovery, although significant challenges remain. While LLMs offer promising
few- and zero-shot learning capabilities, particularly valuable in the
materials domain where expert annotations are scarce, general-purpose LLMs
often fail to address key materials-specific queries without further
adaptation. To bridge this gap, fine-tuning LLMs on human-labeled data is
essential for effective structured knowledge extraction. In this study, we
introduce a novel annotation schema designed to extract generic
process-structure-properties relationships from scientific literature. We
demonstrate the utility of this approach using a dataset of 128 abstracts, with
annotations drawn from two distinct domains: high-temperature materials (Domain
I) and uncertainty quantification in simulating materials microstructure
(Domain II). Initially, we developed a conditional random field (CRF) model
based on MatBERT, a domain-specific BERT variant, and evaluated its performance
on Domain I. Subsequently, we compared this model with a fine-tuned LLM (GPT-4o
from OpenAI) under identical conditions. Our results indicate that fine-tuning
LLMs can significantly improve entity extraction performance over the BERT-CRF
baseline on Domain I. However, when additional examples from Domain II were
incorporated, the performance of the BERT-CRF model became comparable to that
of the GPT-4o model. These findings underscore the potential of our schema for
structured knowledge extraction and highlight the complementary strengths of
both modeling approaches.</p>

    <p>Advancements in theoretical and algorithmic approaches, workflow engines, and
an ever-increasing computational power have enabled a novel paradigm for
materials discovery through first-principles high-throughput simulations. A
major challenge in these efforts is to automate the selection of parameters
used by simulation codes to deliver numerical precision and computational
efficiency. Here, we propose a rigorous methodology to assess the quality of
self-consistent DFT calculations with respect to smearing and $k$-point
sampling across a wide range of crystalline materials. For this goal, we
develop criteria to reliably estimate average errors on total energies, forces,
and other properties as a function of the desired computational efficiency,
while consistently controlling $k$-point sampling errors. The present results
provide automated protocols (named standard solid-state protocols or SSSP) for
selecting optimized parameters based on different choices of precision and
efficiency tradeoffs. These are available through open-source tools that range
from interactive input generators for DFT codes to high-throughput workflows.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Interfaces between materials play a crucial role in the performance of most
devices. However, predicting the structure of a material interface is
computationally demanding due to the vast configuration space, which requires
evaluating an unfeasibly large number of highly complex structures. We
introduce RAFFLE, a software package designed to efficiently explore low-energy
interface configurations between any two crystals. RAFFLE leverages physical
insights and genetic algorithms to intelligently sample the configuration
space, using dynamically evolving 2-, 3-, and 4-body distribution functions as
generalised structural descriptors. These descriptors are iteratively updated
through active learning, which inform atom placement strategies. RAFFLE's
effectiveness is demonstrated across a diverse set of systems, including bulk
materials, intercalation structures, and interfaces. When tested on bulk
aluminium and MoS$_2$, it successfully identifies known ground-state and
high-pressure phases. Applied to intercalation systems, it predicts stable
intercalant phases. For Si|Ge interfaces, RAFFLE identifies intermixing as a
strain compensation mechanism, generating reconstructions that are more stable
than abrupt interfaces. By accelerating interface structure prediction, RAFFLE
offers a powerful tool for materials discovery, enabling efficient exploration
of complex configuration spaces.</p>

    <p>Reinforcement fine-tuning has instrumental enhanced the instruction-following
and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore the
applications of reinforcement fine-tuning to the autoregressive
transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer (arXiv:2403.15734)
using discriminative machine learning models such as interatomic potentials and
property prediction models. By optimizing reward signals-such as energy above
the convex hull and material property figures of merit-reinforcement
fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative
models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in
generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet
conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and
band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning
enables not only the property-guided novel material design ability of
generative pre-trained model but also unlocks property-driven material
retrieval from the unsupervised pre-training dataset. Leveraging rewards from
discriminative models to fine-tune materials generative models opens an
exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for
materials.</p>

    <p>Due to their abundant use in all-solid-state lasers, nonlinear optical (NLO)
crystals are needed for many applications across diverse fields such as
medicine and communication. However, because of conflicting requirements, the
design of suitable inorganic crystals with strong second-harmonic generation

scientists. In this work, we leverage a data-driven approach to accelerate the
search for high-performance NLO materials. We construct an extensive pool of
candidates using databases within the OPTIMADE federation and employ an active
learning strategy to gather optimal data while iteratively improving a machine
learning model. The result is a publicly accessible dataset of $\sim$2,200
computed SHG tensors using density-functional perturbation theory. We further
assess the performance of machine learning models on SHG prediction and
introduce a multi-fidelity correction-learning scheme to refine data accuracy.
This study represents a significant step towards data-driven materials
discovery in the NLO field and demonstrates how new materials can be screened
in an automated fashion.</p>

    <p>Designing inorganic crystalline materials with tailored properties is
critical to technological innovation, yet current generative computational
methods often struggle to efficiently explore desired targets with sufficient
interpretability. Here, we present MatAgent, a generative approach for
inorganic materials discovery that harnesses the powerful reasoning

property evaluation, MatAgent uses iterative, feedback-driven guidance to steer
material exploration precisely toward user-defined targets. Integrated with
external cognitive tools-including short-term memory, long-term memory, the
periodic table, and a comprehensive materials knowledge base-MatAgent emulates
human expert reasoning to vastly expand the accessible compositional space. Our
results demonstrate that MatAgent robustly directs exploration toward desired
properties while consistently achieving high compositional validity,
uniqueness, and material novelty. This framework thus provides a highly
interpretable, practical, and versatile AI-driven solution to accelerate the
discovery and design of next-generation inorganic materials.</p>

    <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific
research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system
sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on
reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for
solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In
this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework
based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly
updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by
traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various
systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid,
demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural,
dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows
for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps,
generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than
4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended
timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical
phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An
open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under

    <p>Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials offer a promising avenue toward

although further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a
preliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by
the RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design
guidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued
discovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date,
expected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs. Finally, we discuss
plans to collaborate with experimental teams on synthesizing and characterizing
AI-designed molecules, which will provide new data to refine and improve our

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The growing computational demand has spurred interest in energy-efficient
frameworks such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A core building block of
modern applications is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), which underpins a
wide range of algorithms in both signal processing and machine learning. In
this work, we propose performing MVM using inverse-designed metastructures,
with heat serving as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a
generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input
and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures,
while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals.
The metastructures are designed using density-based topology optimization,
enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic
differentiation. We apply our methodology to optimize structures that
approximate MVM for matrices of various dimensions, achieving 95.9\% accuracy
for a 3$\times$3 matrix. These results highlight the potential of leveraging
heat conduction for analog computing, with applications in scenarios where
temperature gradients naturally occur, such as in electronic device hotspots,
thermal mapping, and electronic skin.</p>

    <p>Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal
structures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic
simulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced
the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures
across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a
significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based
CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to
efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of
crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between
convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization.
Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware
random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials.
We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP
(PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT
calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal
structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal
NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in

    <p>Thermoelectric materials offer a promising pathway to directly convert waste

due to intrinsic trade-offs between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck
coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which are further complicated by the
presence of defects. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and

Advanced ML approaches including deep neural networks, graph-based models, and
transformer architectures, integrated with high-throughput simulations and

complex multiscale defect space and overcome the curse of dimensionality. This
review discusses AI-enhanced defect engineering strategies such as composition
optimization, entropy and dislocation engineering, and grain boundary design,
along with emerging inverse design techniques for generating materials with
targeted properties. Finally, it outlines future opportunities in novel physics
mechanisms and sustainability, highlighting the critical role of AI in

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Offline optimization is a fundamental challenge in science and engineering,
where the goal is to optimize black-box functions using only offline datasets.
This setting is particularly relevant when querying the objective function is
prohibitively expensive or infeasible, with applications spanning protein
engineering, material discovery, neural architecture search, and beyond. The
main difficulty lies in accurately estimating the objective landscape beyond
the available data, where extrapolations are fraught with significant epistemic
uncertainty. This uncertainty can lead to objective hacking(reward hacking),
exploiting model inaccuracies in unseen regions, or other spurious
optimizations that yield misleadingly high performance estimates outside the
training distribution. Recent advances in model-based optimization(MBO) have
harnessed the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks to develop
offline-specific surrogate and generative models. Trained with carefully
designed strategies, these models are more robust against out-of-distribution
issues, facilitating the discovery of improved designs. Despite its growing
impact in accelerating scientific discovery, the field lacks a comprehensive
review. To bridge this gap, we present the first thorough review of offline
MBO. We begin by formalizing the problem for both single-objective and
multi-objective settings and by reviewing recent benchmarks and evaluation
metrics. We then categorize existing approaches into two key areas: surrogate
modeling, which emphasizes accurate function approximation in
out-of-distribution regions, and generative modeling, which explores
high-dimensional design spaces to identify high-performing designs. Finally, we
examine the key challenges and propose promising directions for advancement in
this rapidly evolving field including safe control of superintelligent systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accelerated materials discovery is an urgent demand to drive advancements in
fields such as energy conversion, storage, and catalysis. Property-directed
generative design has emerged as a transformative approach for rapidly
discovering new functional inorganic materials with multiple desired properties
within vast and complex search spaces. However, this approach faces two primary
challenges: data scarcity for functional properties and the multi-objective
optimization required to balance competing tasks. Here, we present a
multi-property-directed generative framework designed to overcome these
limitations and enhance site symmetry-compliant crystal generation beyond P1
(translational) symmetry. By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data
augmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse
and small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials
simultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation
energy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically
and lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and
cubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their
thermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability
for thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents
a significant step forward in generative design of inorganic materials.</p>

    <p>The electromechanical response of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) near the
morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is strongly influenced by crystallographic
texture and residual stress, both of which affect domain switching behavior.
While these effects are critical for optimizing sensors, actuators, and MEMS
devices, their combined influence remains poorly understood. We present a
computational micromechanical model that captures texture- and stress-dependent
polarization switching in MPB PZT. The framework incorporates both tetragonal
and rhombohedral domain switching, along with interphase transformations,
enabling accurate simulation of nonlinear electromechanical behavior. The model
reproduces key experimental trends, including enhanced piezoelectric response
in (001)-textured ceramics, and degradation under high in-plane stress. The
implementation, provided as open-source MATLAB code, offers an accessible
platform for experimentalists and materials designers to explore and interpret
electromechanical behavior. By linking microstructural orientation and stress

    <p>Heat transfer is a fundamental property of matter. Research spanning decades
has attempted to discover materials with exceptional thermal conductivity, yet
the upper limit remains unknown. Using deep learning accelerated crystal
structure prediction and first-principles calculation, we systematically
explore the thermal conductivity landscape of inorganic crystals. We
brute-force over half a million ordered crystalline structures, encompassing an
extensive coverage of local energy minima in binary compounds with up to four
atoms per primitive cell. We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal
conductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable
crystalline solids at ambient conditions. We also identify over 20 novel
crystals surpassing silicon in thermal conductivity, validated by density
functional theory. These include a semiconductor TaN with ultrahigh thermal
conductivity (~900 $\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$), and metallic
compounds such as MnV that exhibit high lattice and electronic thermal
conductivity simultaneously, a distinctive feature not observed before. These
results as well as the deep learning-driven screening method, redefine the

    <p>The ability to generate 3D multiphase microstructures on-demand with targeted
attributes can greatly accelerate the design of advanced materials. Here, we
present a conditional latent diffusion model (LDM) framework that rapidly
synthesizes high-fidelity 3D multiphase microstructures tailored to user
specifications. Using this approach, we generate diverse two-phase and
three-phase microstructures at high resolution (volumes of $128 \times 128
\times 64$ voxels, representing $>10^6$ voxels each) within seconds, overcoming
the scalability and time limitations of traditional simulation-based methods.
Key design features, such as desired volume fractions and tortuosities, are
incorporated as controllable inputs to guide the generative process, ensuring
that the output structures meet prescribed statistical and topological targets.
Moreover, the framework predicts corresponding manufacturing (processing)
parameters for each generated microstructure, helping to bridge the gap between
digital microstructure design and experimental fabrication. While demonstrated
on organic photovoltaic (OPV) active-layer morphologies, the flexible
architecture of our approach makes it readily adaptable to other material
systems and microstructure datasets. By combining computational efficiency,
adaptability, and experimental relevance, this framework addresses major
limitations of existing methods and offers a powerful tool for accelerated

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials discovery is a computationally intensive process that requires
exploring vast chemical spaces to identify promising candidates with desirable
properties. In this work, we propose using quantum-enhanced machine learning
algorithms following the extremal learning framework to predict novel
heteroacene structures with low hole reorganization energy $\lambda$, a key
property for organic semiconductors. We leverage chemical data generated in a
previous large-scale virtual screening to construct three initial training
datasets containing 54, 99 and 119 molecules encoded using $N=7,16$ and 22
bits, respectively. Furthermore, a sequential learning process is employed to
augment the initial training data with compounds predicted by the algorithms
through iterative retraining. Both algorithms are able to successfully
extrapolate to heteroacene structures with lower $\lambda$ than in the initial
dataset, demonstrating good generalization capabilities even when the amount of
initial data is limited. We observe an improvement in the quality of the
predicted compounds as the number of encoding bits $N$ increases, which offers
an exciting prospect for applying the algorithms to richer chemical spaces that
require larger values of $N$ and hence, in perspective, larger quantum circuits
to deploy the proposed quantum-enhanced protocols.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research,
particularly in computational materials science, by enabling more accurate and

powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering
quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. This
Perspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex
materials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner. Using the
temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of PbTiO$_3$ as
a benchmark, we assess leading universal force fields, including CHGNet, MACE,
M3GNet, and GPTFF, alongside specialized models like UniPero. While universal
MLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium
properties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase
transitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical
instabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in
exchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic
interactions governing dynamic behavior. However, fine-tuning universal models
or employing system-specific MLFFs like UniPero successfully restores
predictive accuracy. We advocates for hybrid approaches combining universal
pretraining with targeted optimization, improved error quantification
frameworks, and community-driven benchmarks to advance MLFFs as robust tools
for computational materials discovery.</p>

    <p>Inverse design approach, which directly generates optimal aerodynamic shape
with neural network models to meet designated performance targets, has drawn
enormous attention. However, the current state-of-the-art inverse design
approach for airfoils, which is based on generative adversarial network,
demonstrates insufficient precision in its generating and training processes
and struggles to reveal the coupling relationship among specified performance
indicators. To address these issues, the airfoil inverse design framework based
on the classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (CDDPM)
is proposed innovatively in this paper. First, the CDDPM can effectively
capture the correlations among specific performance indicators and, by
adjusting the classifier-free guide coefficient, generate corresponding upper
and lower surface pressure coefficient distributions based on designated
pressure features. These distributions are then accurately translated into
airfoil geometries through a mapping model. Experimental results using
classical transonic airfoils as examples show that the inverse design based on
CDDPM can generate a variety of pressure coefficient distributions, which
enriches the diversity of design results. Compared with current
state-of-the-art Wasserstein generative adversarial network methods, CDDPM
achieves a 33.6% precision improvement in airfoil generating tasks. Moreover, a
practical method to readjust each performance indicator value is proposed based
on global optimization algorithm in conjunction with active learning strategy,
aiming to provide rational value combination of performance indicators for the
inverse design framework. This work is not only suitable for the airfoils
design, but also has the capability to apply to optimization process of general
product parts targeting selected performance indicators.</p>

    <p>We introduce a Deep Kernel Learning Variational Autoencoder (VAE-DKL)
framework that integrates the generative power of a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) with the predictive nature of Deep Kernel Learning (DKL). The VAE learns
a latent representation of high-dimensional data, enabling the generation of

alignment with target properties through Gaussian Process (GP) regression. This
approach preserves the generative capabilities of the VAE while enhancing its
latent space for GP-based property prediction. We evaluate the framework on two
datasets: a structured card dataset with predefined variational factors and the
QM9 molecular dataset, where enthalpy serves as the target function for
optimization. The model demonstrates high-precision property prediction and
enables the generation of novel out-of-training subset structures with desired

high-throughput material discovery and molecular design, balancing structured

quickly become intractable when scaling to larger datasets. Here we propose a

while maintaining chemical validity. We demonstrate that MatLLMSearch achieves
a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials

    <p>The vast and complex materials design space demands innovative strategies to
integrate multidisciplinary scientific knowledge and optimize materials
discovery. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
reasoning and automation capabilities across various domains, their application
in materials science remains limited due to a lack of benchmarking standards
and practical implementation frameworks. To address these challenges, we
introduce Mixture-of-Workflows for Self-Corrective Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (CRAG-MoW) - a novel paradigm that orchestrates multiple agentic
workflows employing distinct CRAG strategies using open-source LLMs. Unlike
prior approaches, CRAG-MoW synthesizes diverse outputs through an orchestration
agent, enabling direct evaluation of multiple LLMs across the same problem
domain. We benchmark CRAG-MoWs across small molecules, polymers, and chemical
reactions, as well as multi-modal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral
retrieval. Our results demonstrate that CRAG-MoWs achieve performance
comparable to GPT-4o while being preferred more frequently in comparative
evaluations, highlighting the advantage of structured retrieval and multi-agent
synthesis. By revealing performance variations across data types, CRAG-MoW
provides a scalable, interpretable, and benchmark-driven approach to optimizing
AI architectures for materials discovery. These insights are pivotal in
addressing fundamental gaps in benchmarking LLMs and autonomous AI agents for
scientific applications.</p>

    <p>Deep generative models hold great promise for inverse materials design, yet

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming materials science, enabling both
theoretical advancements and accelerated materials discovery. Recent progress
in crystal generation models, which design crystal structures for targeted
properties, and foundation atomic models (FAMs), which capture interatomic
interactions across the periodic table, has significantly improved inverse
materials design. However, an efficient integration of these two approaches
remains an open challenge. Here, we present an active learning framework that
combines crystal generation models and foundation atomic models to enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of inverse design. As a case study, we employ Con-CDVAE
to generate candidate crystal structures and MACE-MP-0 FAM as one of the
high-throughput screeners for bulk modulus evaluation. Through iterative active
learning, we demonstrate that Con-CDVAE progressively improves its accuracy in
generating crystals with target properties, highlighting the effectiveness of a
property-driven fine-tuning process. Our framework is general to accommodate
different crystal generation and foundation atomic models, and establishes a
scalable approach for AI-driven materials discovery. By bridging generative
modeling with atomic-scale simulations, this work paves the way for more
accurate and efficient inverse materials design.</p>

    <p>The use of transition group metals in electric batteries requires extensive
usage of critical elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which poses
significant environmental challenges. Replacing these metals with redox-active
organic materials offers a promising alternative, thereby reducing the carbon
footprint of batteries by one order of magnitude. However, this approach faces
critical obstacles, including the limited availability of suitable redox-active
organic materials and issues such as lower electronic conductivity, voltage,
specific capacity, and long-term stability. To overcome the limitations for
lower voltage and specific capacity, a machine learning (ML) driven battery
informatics framework is developed and implemented. This framework utilizes an
extensive battery dataset and advanced ML techniques to accelerate and enhance
the identification, optimization, and design of redox-active organic materials.
In this contribution, a data-fusion ML coupled meta learning model capable of
predicting the battery properties, voltage and specific capacity, for various
organic negative electrodes and charge carriers (positive electrode materials)
combinations is presented. The ML models accelerate experimentation, facilitate
the inverse design of battery materials, and identify suitable candidates from
three extensive material libraries to advance sustainable energy-storage
technologies.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively
structures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph
construction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our
approach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually
updated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new
concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates
subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this
feedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network
characterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link
disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges
continue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest
path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our
analysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub'
concepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic,
self-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge
structures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional
reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles
to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that
transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for
open-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific
discovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and
interpretability.</p>

    <p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material design.
While prior efforts focus on 3D diffusion models for their benefits in modeling
continuous 3D conformers, they overlook the advantages of 1D SELFIES-based
Language Models (LMs), which can generate 100% valid molecules and leverage the
billion-scale 1D molecule datasets. To combine these advantages for 3D molecule
generation, we propose a foundation model -- NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D
Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation. NExT-Mol uses an extensively
pretrained molecule LM for 1D molecule generation, and subsequently predicts
the generated molecule's 3D conformers with a 3D diffusion model. We enhance
NExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the
diffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning.
Notably, our 1D molecule LM significantly outperforms baselines in
distributional similarity while ensuring validity, and our 3D diffusion model
achieves leading performances in conformer prediction. Given these improvements
in 1D and 3D modeling, NExT-Mol achieves a 26% relative improvement in 3D FCD
for de novo 3D generation on GEOM-DRUGS, and a 13% average relative gain for
conditional 3D generation on QM9-2014. Our codes and pretrained checkpoints are

    <p>Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule
generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have
consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models
have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking
extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to
molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there
remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area.
Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular
data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is
challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's
growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of
diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review
the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data
modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to
facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area. The

    <p>Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and
artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and
generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models,
researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains,
including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, RNA and even cells.
However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability
to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities
within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form
the "language of nature", we introduce Nature Language Model (NatureLM), a
sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery.
Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a
unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i)
generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using
text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as
protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) top performance
across different domains, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art specialist
models. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific
tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET
optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of
therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. We have developed NatureLM models in
different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and
observed a clear improvement in performance as the model size increases.</p>

    <p>We propose and study a planning problem we call Sequential Fault-Intolerant
Process Planning (SFIPP). SFIPP captures a reward structure common in many
sequential multi-stage decision problems where the planning is deemed
successful only if all stages succeed. Such reward structures are different
from classic additive reward structures and arise in important applications
such as drug/material discovery, security, and quality-critical product design.
We design provably tight online algorithms for settings in which we need to
pick between different actions with unknown success chances at each stage. We
do so both for the foundational case in which the behavior of actions is
deterministic, and the case of probabilistic action outcomes, where we
effectively balance exploration for learning and exploitation for planning
through the usage of multi-armed bandit algorithms. In our empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that the specialized algorithms we develop, which
leverage additional information about the structure of the SFIPP instance,
outperform our more general algorithm.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological
advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must
effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite
design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMatG), a unifying
framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline
materials. OMatG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary
base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad
class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and
flow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by
integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and
extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell
representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates
and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We
benchmark OMatG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)
for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering
stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMatG,
we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMatG
establishes a new state of the art in generative modeling for materials
discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.
These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning
frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science. The OMatG code is

    <p>Novel materials drive progress across applications from energy storage to
electronics. Automated characterization of material structures with machine
learning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in
material design. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive language model
that performs crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data.
The presented model, deCIFer, generates crystal structures in the widely used
Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format and can be conditioned on powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on
high-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use
diffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal
structures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing
challenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative
assessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces
structures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably,
deCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental
diffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for
crystal structure characterization.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing
the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific
downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the
guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions
to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are
often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable,
such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug
discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm
capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$
objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm
is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often
expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple
algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target
generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to
update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction,
which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive
experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image
target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show
$\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and
$\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement,
respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at:

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The inverse design of microstructures plays a pivotal role in optimizing
metamaterials with specific, targeted physical properties. While traditional
forward design methods are constrained by their inability to explore the vast
combinatorial design space, inverse design offers a compelling alternative by
directly generating structures that fulfill predefined performance criteria.
However, achieving precise control over both geometry and material properties
remains a significant challenge due to their intricate interdependence.
Existing approaches, which typically rely on voxel or parametric
representations, often limit design flexibility and structural diversity. In
this work, we present a novel generative model that integrates latent diffusion
with Holoplane, an advanced hybrid neural representation that simultaneously
encodes both geometric and physical properties. This combination ensures
superior alignment between geometry and properties. Our approach generalizes
across multiple microstructure classes, enabling the generation of diverse,
tileable microstructures with significantly improved property accuracy and
enhanced control over geometric validity, surpassing the performance of
existing methods. We introduce a multi-class dataset encompassing a variety of
geometric morphologies, including truss, shell, tube, and plate structures, to
train and validate our model. Experimental results demonstrate the model's
ability to generate microstructures that meet target properties, maintain
geometric validity, and integrate seamlessly into complex assemblies.
Additionally, we explore the potential of our framework through the generation
of new microstructures, cross-class interpolation, and the infilling of
heterogeneous microstructures. The dataset and source code will be open-sourced
upon publication.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The geometric design of structures with optimized physical and chemical
properties is one of the core topics in materials science. However, designing
new functional materials is challenging due to the vast number of existing and
the possible unknown structures to be enumerated and difficulties in mining the
underlying correlations between structures and their properties. Here, we
propose a universal method for periodic structural design and property
optimization. The key in our approach is a deep-learning assisted inverse
Fourier transform, which enables the creation of arbitrary geometries within
crystallographic space groups. It effectively explores extensive parameter
spaces to identify ideal structures with desired properties. Taking the
research of three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures as a case study, this
method is capable of modelling numerous structures and identifying their
photonic bandgaps in just a few hours. We confirmed the established knowledge
that the widest photonic bandgaps exist in network morphologies, among which
the single diamond (dia net) reigns supreme. Additionally, this method
identified a rarely-known lcs topology with excellent photonic properties,
highlighting the infinitely extensible application boundaries of our approach.
This work demonstrates the high efficiency and effectiveness of the
Fourier-based method, advancing material design and providing insights for
next-generation functional materials.</p>

    <p>The tunability of physical properties in transition metal dichalcogenides

development of next-generation optoelectronic and high-tech applications.
Building upon prior work on machine learning-driven material design, this study
focuses on the systematic introduction and manipulation of point defects in
MoS2 to tailor their properties. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset generated
via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the effects of
various defect types and concentrations on the mate rial characteristics of
TMDCs. Our methodology integrates the use of pre-trained large language models
to generate defect configurations, enabling efficient predictions of
defect-induced property modifications. This research differs from traditional
methods of material generation and discovery by utilizing the latest advances
in transformer model architecture, which have proven to be efficient and
accurate discrete predictors. In contrast to high-throughput methods where
configurations are generated randomly and then screened based on their physical
properties, our approach not only enhances the understanding of defect-property
relationships in TMDCs but also provides a robust framework for designing
materials with bespoke properties. This facilitates the advancement of
materials science and technology.</p>

    <p>The inherent flexibility of two dimensional materials allows for efficient
manipulation of their physical properties through strain application, which is
essential for the development of advanced nanoscale devices. This study aimed
to understand the impact of mechanical strain on the magnetic properties of two
dimensional materials using Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of several
strain states on the magnetic properties were investigated using the Lennard
Jones potential and bond length-dependent exchange interactions. The key
parameters analyzed include the Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution
function, and magnetization in relation to temperature and magnetic field. The
results indicate that applying biaxial tensile strain generally reduces the
critical temperature. In contrast, the biaxial compressive strain increased Tc
within the elastic range, but decreased at higher strain levels. Both
compressive and tensile strains significantly influence the ferromagnetic
properties and structural ordering, as evidenced by magnetization hysteresis.
Notably, pure shear strain did not induce disorder, leaving the magnetization
unaffected. In addition, our findings suggest the potential of domain-formation
mechanisms. This study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of
mechanical strain on the magnetic behavior and structural integrity of 2D
materials, offering valuable guidance for future research and advanced material
design applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Metals have high electronic conductivities, but very low Seebeck
coefficients, which traditionally make them unsuitable for thermoelectric
materials. Recent studies, however, showed that metals can deliver ultra-high
thermoelectric power factors (PFs) under certain conditions. In this work, we
theoretically examine the electronic structure and electronic transport
specifications which allow for such high PFs. Using Boltzmann transport (BTE)
simulations and a multi-band electronic structure model, we show that metals
with: i) high degree of transport asymmetry between their bands, ii) strong
inter-band scattering, and iii) a large degree of band overlap, can provide
ultra-high power factors. We show that each of these characteristics adds to
the steepness of the transport distribution function of the BTE, which allows
for an increase of the Seebeck coefficient to sizable values, simultaneously
with an increase in the electrical conductivity. This work generalizes the
concept that transport asymmetry (i.e., mixture of energy regions of high and
low contributions to the electrical conductivity), through a combination of
different band masses, scattering strengths, or energy filtering scenarios,
etc., can indeed result in very high thermoelectric power factors, even in the
absence of a material bandgap. Under certain conditions, transport asymmetry
can over-compensate any performance degradation to the PF due to bipolar
conduction and the naturally low Seebeck coefficients that otherwise exist in
this class of materials.</p>

    <p>The discovery of novel materials with tailored electronic properties is

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to accelerate the discovery of stable vanadium

capturing atomic positions and lattice parameters while maintaining chemical
validity. Applying this framework, we generated 451 unique V-O compositions,
with 91 stable and 44 metastable under rigorous thermodynamic criteria.
Notably, we uncovered several novel V2O3 configurations with formation energies
below the Materials Project convex hull, revealing previously unknown stable
phases. Detailed spin-polarized DFT+U calculations showed distinct electronic
behaviors, including promising half-metallic characteristics. Our approach
outperforms existing methods in both quality and stability, demonstrating about
a 20 percent stability rate under strict criteria compared to earlier
benchmarks. Additionally, phonon calculations performed on selected
compositions confirm dynamic stability: minor imaginary modes at 0 K likely
stem from finite-size effects or known phase transitions, suggesting that these
materials remain stable or metastable in practical conditions. These findings

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials
discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this
work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration
of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds -
against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational
autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established
methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are
stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast,
generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when
sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties
such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of
both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation
screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability
and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including
universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to
substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains
computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward
more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing
baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued
advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of
novel materials that are thermodynamically stable.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Graph neural network universal interatomic potentials (GNN-UIPs) have
demonstrated remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities in material
discovery and property prediction. These models can accelerate molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation by several orders of magnitude while maintaining
\textit{ab initio} accuracy, making them a promising new paradigm in material
simulations. One notable example is Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network
(CHGNet), pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments
from the MPtrj dataset, representing a state-of-the-art GNN-UIP model for
charge-informed MD simulations. However, training the CHGNet model is
time-consuming(8.3 days on one A100 GPU) for three reasons: (i) requiring
multi-layer propagation to reach more distant atom information, (ii) requiring
second-order derivatives calculation to finish weights updating and (iii) the
implementation of reference CHGNet does not fully leverage the computational
capabilities. This paper introduces FastCHGNet, an optimized CHGNet, with three
contributions: Firstly, we design innovative Force/Stress Readout modules to
decompose Force/Stress prediction. Secondly, we adopt massive optimizations
such as kernel fusion, redundancy bypass, etc, to exploit GPU computation power
sufficiently. Finally, we extend CHGNet to support multiple GPUs and propose a
load-balancing technique to enhance GPU utilization. Numerical results show
that FastCHGNet reduces memory footprint by a factor of 3.59. The final
training time of FastCHGNet can be decreased to \textbf{1.53 hours} on 32 GPUs
without sacrificing model accuracy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>PearSAN is a machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm applicable to
inverse design problems with large design spaces, where traditional optimizers
struggle. The algorithm leverages the latent space of a generative model for
rapid sampling and employs a Pearson correlated surrogate model to predict the
figure of merit of the true design metric. As a showcase example, PearSAN is
applied to thermophotovoltaic (TPV) metasurface design by matching the working
bands between a thermal radiator and a photovoltaic cell. PearSAN can work with
any pretrained generative model with a discretized latent space, making it easy
to integrate with VQ-VAEs and binary autoencoders. Its novel Pearson
correlational loss can be used as both a latent regularization method, similar
to batch and layer normalization, and as a surrogate training loss. We compare
both to previous energy matching losses, which are shown to enforce poor
regularization and performance, even with upgraded affine parameters. PearSAN
achieves a state-of-the-art maximum design efficiency of 97%, and is at least
an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, with an improved maximum
figure-of-merit gain.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative model for 2D materials has shown significant promise in
accelerating the material discovery process. The stability and performance of
these materials are strongly influenced by their underlying symmetry. However,
existing generative models for 2D materials often neglect symmetry constraints,
which limits both the diversity and quality of the generated structures. Here,
we introduce a symmetry-constrained diffusion model (SCDM) that integrates
space group symmetry into the generative process. By incorporating Wyckoff
positions, the model ensures adherence to symmetry principles, leading to the
generation of 2,000 candidate structures. DFT calculations were conducted to
evaluate the convex hull energies of these structures after structural
relaxation. From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy
stability criteria (Ehull < 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six
candidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band
structure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which
exhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a
symmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure
prediction model. The results highlight that incorporating symmetry constraints
enhances the effectiveness of generated 2D materials, making a contribution to
the discovery of 2D materials through generative modeling.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical
applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented
properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display
exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in
energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian
approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging
computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the
rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of
first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose
challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover,
the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and
often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we
review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates
data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and
accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials
design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide
an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator
transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with
practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify
multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for
their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in
data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and
property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked
issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing
methods to mitigate the gaps.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>As microstructure property models improve, additional information from
crystallographic degrees of freedom and grain boundary networks (GBNs) can be
included in microstructure design problems. However, the high dimensional
nature of including this information precludes the use of many common
optimization approaches and requires less efficient methods to generate quality
designs. Previous work demonstrated that human-in-the-loop optimization,
instantiated as a video game, achieved high-quality, efficient solutions to
these design problems. However, such data is expensive to obtain. In the
present work, we show how a Decision Transformer machine learning (ML) model
can be used to learn from the optimization trajectories generated by human
players, and subsequently solve materials design problems. We compare the ML
optimization trajectories against players and a common global optimization
algorithm: simulated annealing (SA). We find that the ML model exhibits a
validation accuracy of 84% against player decisions, and achieves solutions of
comparable quality to SA (92%), but does so using three orders of magnitude
fewer iterations. We find that the ML model generalizes in important and
surprising ways, including the ability to train using a simple constitutive
structure-property model and then solve microstructure design problems for a
different, higher-fidelity, constitutive structure-property model without any
retraining. These results demonstrate the potential of Decision Transformer
models for the solution of materials design problems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Lithium superionic conductors (LSICs) are crucial for next-generation
solid-state batteries, offering exceptional ionic conductivity and enhanced
safety for renewable energy and electric vehicles. However, their discovery is
extremely challenging due to the vast chemical space, limited labeled data, and
the understanding of complex structure-function relationships required for
optimizing ion transport. This study introduces a multiscale topological
learning (MTL) framework, integrating algebraic topology and unsupervised
learning to tackle these challenges efficiently. By modeling lithium-only and
lithium-free substructures, the framework extracts multiscale topological
features and introduces two topological screening metrics-cycle density and
minimum connectivity distance-to ensure structural connectivity and ion
diffusion compatibility. Promising candidates are clustered via unsupervised
algorithms to identify those resembling known superionic conductors. For final
refinement, candidates that pass chemical screening undergo ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations for validation. This approach led to the discovery of 14
novel LSICs, four of which have been independently validated in recent
experiments. This success accelerates the identification of LSICs and
demonstrates broad adaptability, offering a scalable tool for addressing
complex materials discovery challenges.</p>

    <p>Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global
challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature
comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in
knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials
research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective
deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving
domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models
for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models
on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data.
Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in
materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining
general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant
demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation,
predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table.
Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2,
we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific
performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured
information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal
structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs.
Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain
adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials
research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important
considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training
methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the
development of specialized scientific AI systems.</p>

\chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions that satisfy all known necessary conditions to
construct 3D disordered stealthy hyperuniform, standard hyperuniform,
nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous material systems
at varying phase volume fractions. We show that a rich spectrum of distinct
structures within each of the above classes of materials can be generated by
tuning correlations in the system across length scales. We present the first
realization of antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials in 3D, which
are characterized by a power-law autocovariance function $\chi_{_V}(r)$ and
contain clusters of dramatically different sizes and morphologies. We also
determine the diffusion spreadability ${\cal S}(t)$ and estimate the fluid
permeability $k$ associated with all of the constructed materials directly from
the corresponding ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions. We find that varying the
length-scale parameter within each class of ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions
can also lead to orders of magnitude variation of ${\cal S}(t)$ at intermediate

$\phi_1$ and correlation length $a$ in the constructed media generally leads to
a decrease in the dimensionless fluid permeability $k/a^2$. These results

    <p>Planning and conducting chemical syntheses remains a major bottleneck in the
discovery of functional small molecules, and prevents fully leveraging
generative AI for molecular inverse design. While early work has shown that
ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low
accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As
multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the
underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by
the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use
different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for
building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse
sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling
strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which
already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through
experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits,
we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to
the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the
scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level
organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of
quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal
dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization
under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we
anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate
models.</p>

    <p>Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of
amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune
features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to
specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the
structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent
bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs
have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated
inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified
in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse
design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the
simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much
stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the
mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across
a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable
parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our
formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter
changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability.
These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference
between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to
both understand and perform inverse design.</p>

    <p>Designing fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) with a tailored
nonlinear stress-strain response can enable innovative applications across
various industries. Currently, no efforts have achieved the inverse design of
FRPCs that target the entire stress-strain curve. Here, we develop
PC3D_Diffusion, a 3D spatial diffusion model designed for the inverse design of
FRPCs. We generate 1.35 million FRPCs and calculate their stress-strain curves
for training. Although the vanilla PC3D_Diffusion can generate visually
appealing results, less than 10% of FRPCs generated by the vanilla model are
collision-free, in which fibers do not intersect with each other. We then
propose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to apply physical constraints
during generation. As a result, PC3D_Diffusion can generate high-quality
designs with tailored mechanical behaviors while guaranteeing to satisfy the
physical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may
facilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential
applications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical
properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning promises to accelerate the material discovery by enabling
high-throughput prediction of desirable macro-properties from atomic-level
descriptors or structures. However, the limited data available about precise
values of these properties have been a barrier, leading to predictive models
with limited precision or the ability to generalize. This is particularly true
of lattice thermal conductivity (LTC): existing datasets of precise (ab initio,
DFT-based) computed values are limited to a few dozen materials with little
variability. Based on such datasets, we study the impact of transfer learning
on both the precision and generalizability of a deep learning model
(ParAIsite). We start from an existing model (MEGNet~\cite{Chen2019}) and show
that improvements are obtained by fine-tuning a pre-trained version on
different tasks. Interestingly, we also show that a much greater improvement is
obtained when first fine-tuning it on a large datasets of low-quality
approximations of LTC (based on the AGL model) and then applying a second phase
of fine-tuning with our high-quality, smaller-scale datasets. The promising
results obtained pave the way not only towards a greater ability to explore
large databases in search of low thermal conductivity materials but also to
methods enabling increasingly precise predictions in areas where quality data
are rare.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Uncovering the underlying laws governing correlations between different
materials properties, and the structure-composition-property relationship, is
essential for advancing materials theory and enabling efficient materials
design. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
large language models (LLMs), symbolic regression has emerged as a powerful
method for deriving explicit formulas for materials laws. LLMs, with their
pre-trained, cross-disciplinary knowledge, present a promising direction in "AI
for Materials". In this work, we introduce a multi-agent framework based on
LLMs specifically designed for symbolic regression in materials science. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using the glass-forming ability
(GFA) of metallic glasses as a case study, employing three characteristic
temperatures as independent variables. Our framework derived an interpretable
formula to describe GFA, achieving a correlation coefficient of up to 0.948
with low formula complexity. This approach outperforms standard packages such
as GPlearn and demonstrates a ~30% improvement over random generation methods,
owing to integrated memory and reflection mechanisms. The proposed framework
can be extended to discover laws in various materials applications, supporting
new materials design and enhancing the interpretation of experimental and
simulation data.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Correlations between fundamental microscopic properties computable from first
principles, which we term canonical properties, and complex large-scale
quantities of interest (QoIs) provide an avenue to predictive materials
discovery. We propose that such correlations can be efficiently discovered
through simulations utilizing approximate interatomic potentials (IPs), which
serve as an ensemble of "synthetic materials." As a proof of principle we build
a regression model relating canonical properties to the symmetric tilt grain
boundary (GB) energy curves in face-centered cubic crystals, characterized by
the scaling factor in the universal lattice matching model of Runnels et al.
(2016), which we take to be our QoI. Our analysis recovers known correlations
of GB energy to other properties and discovers new ones. We also demonstrate,
using available density functional theory (DFT) GB energy data, that the
regression model constructed from IP data is consistent with DFT results,
confirming the assumption that the IPs and DFT belong to same statistical pool
and thereby validating the approach. Regression models constructed in this
fashion can be used to predict large-scale QoIs based on first-principles data
and provide a general method for training IPs for QoIs beyond the scope of
first-principles calculations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accurate phase diagram prediction is crucial for understanding alloy
thermodynamics and advancing materials design. While traditional CALPHAD
methods are robust, they are resource-intensive and limited by experimentally
assessed data. This work explores the use of machine learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs) such as M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, and ORB to
significantly accelerate phase diagram calculations by using the Alloy
Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) to map calculations of the energies and free
energies of atomistic systems to CALPHAD-compatible thermodynamic descriptions.
Using case studies including Cr-Mo, Cu-Au, and Pt-W, we demonstrate that MLIPs,
particularly ORB, achieve computational speedups exceeding three orders of
magnitude compared to DFT while maintaining phase stability predictions within
acceptable accuracy. Extending this approach to liquid phases and ternary
systems like Cr-Mo-V highlights its versatility for high-entropy alloys and
complex chemical spaces. This work demonstrates that MLIPs, integrated with
tools like ATAT within a CALPHAD framework, provide an efficient and accurate
framework for high-throughput thermodynamic modeling, enabling rapid
exploration of novel alloy systems. While many challenges remain to be
addressed, the accuracy of some of these MLIPs (ORB in particular) are on the
verge of paving the way toward high-throughput generation of CALPHAD
thermodynamic descriptions of multi-component, multi-phase alloy systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Active learning (AL) is a powerful sequential optimization approach that has
shown great promise in the discovery of new materials. However, a major
challenge remains the acquisition of the initial data and the development of
workflows to generate new data at each iteration. In this study, we demonstrate
a significant speedup in an optimization task by reusing a published simulation
workflow available for online simulations and its associated data repository,
where the results of each workflow run are automatically stored. Both the
workflow and its data follow FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and
reusable) principles using nanoHUB's infrastructure. The workflow employs
molecular dynamics to calculate the melting temperature of multi-principal
component alloys. We leveraged all prior data not only to develop an accurate
machine learning model to start the sequential optimization but also to
optimize the simulation parameters and accelerate convergence. Prior work
showed that finding the alloy composition with the highest melting temperature
required testing 15 alloy compositions, and establishing the melting
temperature for each composition took, on average, 4 simulations. By developing
a workflow that utilizes the FAIR data in the nanoHUB database, we reduced the
number of simulations per composition to one and found the alloy with the
lowest melting temperature testing only three compositions. This second
optimization, therefore, shows a speedup of 10x as compared to models that do
not access the FAIR databases.</p>

    <p>Machine learning (ML) methods have drawn significant interest in material
design and discovery. Graph neural networks (GNNs), in particular, have
demonstrated strong potential for predicting material properties. The present
study proposes a graph-based representation for modeling medium-entropy alloys
(MEAs). Hybrid Monte-Carlo molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations are employed
to achieve thermally stable structures across various annealing temperatures in
an MEA. These simulations generate dump files and potential energy labels,
which are used to construct graph representations of the atomic configurations.
Edges are created between each atom and its 12 nearest neighbors without
incorporating explicit edge features. These graphs then serve as input for a
Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) based ML model to predict the
system's potential energy. The GCNN architecture effectively captures the local
environment and chemical ordering within the MEA structure. The GCNN-based ML
model demonstrates strong performance in predicting potential energy at
different steps, showing satisfactory results on both the training data and
unseen configurations. Our approach presents a graph-based modeling framework
for MEAs and high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which effectively captures the local
chemical order (LCO) within the alloy structure. This allows us to predict key
material properties influenced by LCO in both MEAs and HEAs, providing deeper
insights into how atomic-scale arrangements affect the properties of these
alloys.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>There has been a growing excitement that implicit graph generative models
could be used to design or discover new molecules for medicine or material
design. Because these molecules have not been discovered, they naturally lie in
unexplored or scarcely supported regions of the distribution of known
molecules. However, prior evaluation methods for implicit graph generative
models have focused on validating statistics computed from the thick support
(e.g., mean and variance of a graph property). Therefore, there is a mismatch
between the goal of generating novel graphs and the evaluation methods. To
address this evaluation gap, we design a novel evaluation method called
Vertical Validation (VV) that systematically creates thin support regions
during the train-test splitting procedure and then reweights generated samples
so that they can be compared to the held-out test data. This procedure can be
seen as a generalization of the standard train-test procedure except that the
splits are dependent on sample features. We demonstrate that our method can be
used to perform model selection if performance on thin support regions is the
desired goal. As a side benefit, we also show that our approach can better
detect overfitting as exemplified by memorization.</p>

    <p>Efficient and accurate prediction of material properties is critical for

predictions, complementing experimental measurements and multi-scale
computational methods. We focus on predicting the elastic constant tensor, as a

and for materials discovery. The proposed ElaTBot LLM enables simultaneous
prediction of elastic constant tensors, bulk modulus at finite temperatures,
and the generation of new materials with targeted properties. Moreover, the
capabilities of ElaTBot are further enhanced by integrating with general LLMs
(GPT-4o) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prediction. A specialized
variant, ElaTBot-DFT, designed for 0 K elastic constant tensor prediction,
reduces the prediction errors by 33.1% compared with domain-specific, material

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Material discovery is a cornerstone of modern science, driving advancements
in diverse disciplines from biomedical technology to climate solutions.
Predicting synthesizability, a critical factor in realizing novel materials,
remains a complex challenge due to the limitations of traditional heuristics
and thermodynamic proxies. While stability metrics such as formation energy
offer partial insights, they fail to account for kinetic factors and
technological constraints that influence synthesis outcomes. These challenges
are further compounded by the scarcity of negative data, as failed synthesis
attempts are often unpublished or context-specific.
  We present SynCoTrain, a semi-supervised machine learning model designed to
predict the synthesizability of materials. SynCoTrain employs a co-training
framework leveraging two complementary graph convolutional neural networks:
SchNet and ALIGNN. By iteratively exchanging predictions between classifiers,
SynCoTrain mitigates model bias and enhances generalizability. Our approach
uses Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning to address the absence of explicit
negative data, iteratively refining predictions through collaborative learning.
  The model demonstrates robust performance, achieving high recall on internal
and leave-out test sets. By focusing on oxide crystals, a well-characterized
material family with extensive experimental data, we establish SynCoTrain as a
reliable tool for predicting synthesizability while balancing dataset
variability and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of
co-training to advance high-throughput materials discovery and generative
research, offering a scalable solution to the challenge of synthesizability
prediction.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological
development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding
properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple
degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This
poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials.
Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments
and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material
properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power,
researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation
methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput
computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial
intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the
effective characterization of the implicit association between material
properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the
inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in
inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models,
attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid
technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements
in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key
findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we
summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the
latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new
energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances
in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal
structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling
without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to
identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties.
In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes
multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures
with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate
constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated
by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which
considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a
subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation
process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a
probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of
existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals
strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of
supply chain during production.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Although electronic density of states (DOS) is fundamental to materials
properties, its general relationship to mechanical properties of alloys is not
well established. In this paper, using density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, we show that the electronic occupancy at the Fermi level, N(Ef),
obtained from DOS is a key descriptor of alloy strength and ductility. Our
comprehensive analysis of numerous body centered cubic (BCC) refractory high
entropy alloys (RHEAs) shows an overwhelming correlation that low N(Ef)
indicates strong bonds that have high stiffness resulting in high elastic
constants. High bond stiffness indicates presence of covalent nature of bonds
that are directional in nature resulting in resistance to deformation leading
to high bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli. Consequently, N(Ef) provides a direct
correlation to the tendency of alloy ductility evidenced in the Pugh ratio
(G/B). As stiffer bonds result in lower local lattice distortion (LLD), N(Ef)
are LLD are also found to be corelated which opens up a correlation to solid
solution strengthening and yield strength. Thus, this work unveils fundamental
correlations between N(Ef) and (1) elastic bond strength, (2) ductility, and
(3) LLD. These correlations open opportunities for the design of high strength
high ductile RHEAs.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Discovering new solid-state materials requires rapidly exploring the vast
space of crystal structures and locating stable regions. Generating stable
materials with desired properties and compositions is extremely difficult as we
search for very small isolated pockets in the exponentially many possibilities,
considering elements from the periodic table and their 3D arrangements in
crystal lattices. Materials discovery necessitates both optimized solution
structures and diversity in the generated material structures. Existing methods
struggle to explore large material spaces and generate diverse samples with
desired properties and requirements. We propose the Symmetry-aware Hierarchical
Architecture for Flow-based Traversal (SHAFT), a novel generative model
employing a hierarchical exploration strategy to efficiently exploit the
symmetry of the materials space to generate crystal structures given desired
properties. In particular, our model decomposes the exponentially large
materials space into a hierarchy of subspaces consisting of symmetric space
groups, lattice parameters, and atoms. We demonstrate that SHAFT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art iterative generative methods, such as Generative
Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoders
(CDVAE), in crystal structure generation tasks, achieving higher validity,
diversity, and stability of generated structures optimized for target

    <p>Polymeric nano- and micro-scale particles have critical roles in tackling
critical healthcare and energy challenges with their miniature characteristics.
However, tailoring their synthesis process to meet specific design targets has
traditionally depended on domain expertise and costly trial-and-errors.
Recently, modeling strategies, particularly Bayesian optimization (BO), have
been proposed to aid materials discovery for maximized/minimized properties.
Coming from practical demands, this study for the first time integrates
constrained and composite Bayesian optimization (CCBO) to perform efficient
target value optimization under black-box feasibility constraints and limited
data for laboratory experimentation. Using a synthetic problem that simulates
electrospraying, a model nanomanufacturing process, CCBO strategically avoided
infeasible conditions and efficiently optimized particle production towards
predefined size targets, surpassing standard BO pipelines and providing
decisions comparable to human experts. Further laboratory experiments validated
CCBO capability to guide the rational synthesis of poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid) (PLGA) particles with diameters of 300 nm and 3.0 $\mu$m via
electrospraying. With minimal initial data and unknown experiment constraints,
CCBO reached the design targets within 4 iterations. Overall, the CCBO approach
presents a versatile and holistic optimization paradigm for next-generation
target-driven particle synthesis empowered by artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

    <p>For a very long time, computational approaches to the design of new materials
have relied on an iterative process of finding a candidate material and
modeling its properties. AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping
to accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and
structures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven
approaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the
process of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches
to the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse
problem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without
utilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1)
conditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an
arbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most
energetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2)
conditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that
includes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types,
chemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss
function was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of
crystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching,
usual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches.
As a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare
target structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our
modifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy
41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency,
inference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new
structures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.</p>

    <p>Materials with J-shaped stress-strain behavior under uniaxial stretching,
where strength increases as deformation progresses, have been developed through
various materials designs. On the other hand, polymer materials that
progressively stiffen under bending remain unrealized. To address this gap,
this study drew inspiration from membrane tensegrity structures, which achieve
structural stability by balancing compressive forces in rods and tensile forces
in membrane. Notably, some of these structures exhibit increased stiffness
under bending. Using a multipolymer patterning technique, we developed a
polymer film exhibiting membrane tensegrity-like properties that stiffens under
bending. This effect results from membrane tension generated by rod protrusions
and an increase in second moment of area at regions with maximum curvature.</p>

    <p>Pure currents comprise the flow of a two state quantum freedom -- for example
the electron spin -- in the absence of charge flow. Radically different from
the charge currents that underpin present day electronics, in two dimensional
materials possessing additional two state freedoms such as valley index they
offer profound possibilities for miniaturization and energy efficiency in a
next generation spin- and valley- tronics. Here we demonstrate a robust
multi-pump light wave protocol capable of generating both pure spin and valley
currents on femtosecond times. The generation time is determined by the 2d
material gap, with the creation of pure spin current in WSe2 at 40 fs and pure
valley current in bilayer graphene at ~200 fs. Our all-optical approach demands
no special material design, requiring only a gapped valley active material, and
is thus applicable to a wide range of 2d materials.</p>

    <p>Material discovery is a critical area of research with the potential to
revolutionize various fields, including carbon capture, renewable energy, and

challenging to explore all possible materials experimentally. In this paper, we
introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models
(LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline
materials. FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base
distribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting
to a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and
iteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation
rate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for
stable, unique, and novel crystals by $\sim50\%$ - a huge improvement on a
difficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much
closer to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model,
significantly reducing post-hoc computational cost.</p>

    <p>In recent years, the realm of crystalline materials has witnessed a surge in

potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional
materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of
SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and

robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES.
Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we
have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical

autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot

three models: LHS2RHS, predicting products from reactants; RHS2LHS, predicting
reactants from products; and TGT2CEQ, generating full chemical equations for
target compounds. Fine-tuned on a text-mined synthesis database, our model
raises accuracy from under 40% with pretrained models, to under 80% using
conventional fine-tuning, and further to around 90% with our proposed
generalized Tanimoto similarity, while maintaining robust to additional
synthesis steps. Our model further demonstrates comparable performance across
materials with varying degrees of quantumness quantified using quantum weight,
indicating that LLMs offer a powerful tool to predict balanced chemical

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Under some initial and boundary conditions, the rapid reaction-thermal
diffusion process taking place during frontal polymerization (FP) destabilizes
the planar mode of front propagation, leading to spatially varying, complex
hierarchical patterns in thermoset polymeric materials. Although modern
reaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP,
the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that
produce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and
non-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In
this work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate
conditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of
hierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes
both the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design
space. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters is
significantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter training
time while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images,
the trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions that
produce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.</p>

    <p>Designing functional transition metal complexes (TMCs) faces challenges due
to the vast search space of metals and ligands, requiring efficient
optimization strategies. Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly
used, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical
objectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA
tasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into
the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single-
and multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses
traditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during
their extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs
utilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming
those focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies
eight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200
candidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using
natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into
multi-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for
intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new
ligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and
external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization
and molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained
foundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee
broad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and
materials design.</p>

    <p>Large neural networks excel at prediction tasks, but their application to
design problems, such as protein engineering or materials discovery, requires
solving offline model-based optimization (MBO) problems. While predictive
models may not directly translate to effective design, recent MBO algorithms
incorporate reinforcement learning and generative modeling approaches.
Meanwhile, theoretical work suggests that exploiting the target function's
structure can enhance MBO performance. We present Cliqueformer, a
transformer-based architecture that learns the black-box function's structure
through functional graphical models (FGM), addressing distribution shift
without relying on explicit conservative approaches. Across various domains,
including chemical and genetic design tasks, Cliqueformer demonstrates superior

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials
design by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained
property predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is
hindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such
as charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local
minima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these
issues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive
Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and
template-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid
poor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without
retraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional
targets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal
systems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced
with gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five
target properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and
Bayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite
structures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at
which the other methods fail entirely.</p>

    <p>While large language models (LLMs) have integrated images, adapting them to
graphs remains challenging, limiting their applications in materials and drug
design. This difficulty stems from the need for coherent autoregressive
generation across texts and graphs. To address this, we introduce Llamole, the
first multimodal LLM capable of interleaved text and graph generation, enabling
molecular inverse design with retrosynthetic planning. Llamole integrates a
base LLM with the Graph Diffusion Transformer and Graph Neural Networks for
multi-conditional molecular generation and reaction inference within texts,
while the LLM, with enhanced molecular understanding, flexibly controls
activation among the different graph modules. Additionally, Llamole integrates
A* search with LLM-based cost functions for efficient retrosynthetic planning.
We create benchmarking datasets and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
Llamole against in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Llamole
significantly outperforms 14 adapted LLMs across 12 metrics for controllable
molecular design and retrosynthetic planning.</p>

    <p>We present a novel method for predicting binary phase diagrams through the
automatic construction of a minimal basis set of representative templates. The
core assumption is that any materials space can be divided into a small number
of regions with similar chemical tendencies and bonding properties, and that a
minimal set of templates can efficiently represent the key chemical trends
across the different regions. By combining data-driven techniques with
ab-initio crystal structure prediction, we can efficiently partition the
materials space and construct templates reflecting variations in chemical
behavior. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method predicts binary
convex hulls with accuracy comparable to resource-intensive EA searches, while
achieving a significant reduction in computational time (by a factor of 25).
The method can be extended to ternary and multinary systems, enabling efficient
high-throughput exploration and mapping of complex material spaces. By
providing a transformative solution for high-throughput materials discovery,
our approach paves the way for uncovering advanced quantum materials and
accelerating in silico design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The demand for innovative synthetic polymers with improved properties is
high, but their structural complexity and vast design space hinder rapid
discovery. Machine learning-guided molecular design is a promising approach to
accelerate polymer discovery. However, the scarcity of labeled polymer data and
the complex hierarchical structure of synthetic polymers make generative design
particularly challenging. We advance the current state-of-the-art approaches to
generate not only repeating units, but monomer ensembles including their
stoichiometry and chain architecture. We build upon a recent polymer
representation that includes stoichiometries and chain architectures of monomer
ensembles and develop a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture
encoding a graph and decoding a string. Using a semi-supervised setup, we
enable the handling of partly labelled datasets which can be benefitial for
domains with a small corpus of labelled data. Our model learns a continuous,
well organized latent space (LS) that enables de-novo generation of copolymer
structures including different monomer stoichiometries and chain architectures.
In an inverse design case study, we demonstrate our model for in-silico
discovery of novel conjugated copolymer photocatalysts for hydrogen production
using optimization of the polymer's electron affinity and ionization potential
in the latent space.</p>

Experimental results demonstrate that our image-based approach can analyze and

    <p>The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice
structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional
atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building
blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and
strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$.
Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and
fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and
large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic
band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band
edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the
acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption
enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively,
while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can
separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally,
the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more
than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing
spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work
provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of
fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and

    <p>Metamaterials, synthetic materials with customized properties, have emerged
as a promising field due to advancements in additive manufacturing. These
materials derive unique mechanical properties from their internal lattice
structures, which are often composed of multiple materials that repeat
geometric patterns. While traditional inverse design approaches have shown
potential, they struggle to map nonlinear material behavior to multiple
possible structural configurations. This paper presents a novel framework
leveraging video diffusion models, a type of generative artificial Intelligence
(AI), for inverse multi-material design based on nonlinear stress-strain
responses. Our approach consists of two key components: (1) a fields generator
using a video diffusion model to create solution fields based on target
nonlinear stress-strain responses, and (2) a structure identifier employing two
UNet models to determine the corresponding multi-material 2D design. By
incorporating multiple materials, plasticity, and large deformation, our
innovative design method allows for enhanced control over the highly nonlinear
mechanical behavior of metamaterials commonly seen in real-world applications.
It offers a promising solution for generating next-generation metamaterials
with finely tuned mechanical characteristics.</p>

    <p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning
workhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields
such as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures.
Multicomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can
exhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a
variety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to
fully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability,
strength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on
orderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure
GCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the
ordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we
benchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the
ordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made
dataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional
symmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference
between the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same
material, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently
preserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various
orderings.</p>

    <p>Perovskites with the generic composition ABO$_3$ exhibit an enormous variety
of quantum states such as magnetism, orbital order, ferroelectricity and
superconductivity. Their flexible and comparatively simple structure allows for
facile chemical substitution and cube-on-cube combination of different
compounds in atomically sharp epitaxial heterostructures. However, already in
the bulk, the diverse physical properties of perovskites and their anisotropy
are determined by small deviations from the ideal perovskite structure, which
are difficult to control. Here we show that directional imprinting of atomic
displacements in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator YVO$_3$ is achieved by
depositing epitaxial films on different facets of an isostructural substrate.
These facets were chosen such that other control parameters, including strain
and polarity mismatch with the overlayer, remain unchanged. We use polarized
Raman scattering and spectral ellipsometry to detect signatures of staggered
orbital and magnetic order, and demonstrate distinct spin-orbital ordering
patterns on different facets. These observations can be attributed to the
influence of specific octahedral rotation and cation displacement patterns,
which are imprinted by the substrate facet, on the covalency of the bonds and
the superexchange interactions in YVO$_3$. Well beyond established
strain-engineering strategies, our results show that substrate-induced
templating of lattice distortion patterns constitutes a powerful pathway for
materials design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Interconversion between charge and spin currents is a key phenomenon in
realizing next-generation spintronic devices. Highly efficient spin-charge
interconversion is expected to occur at band crossing points in materials with
large spin-orbit interactions due to enhanced spin Berry curvature. On the
other hand, if defects and/or impurities are present, they affect the
electronic band structure, which in turn reduces the spin Berry curvature.
Although defects and impurities are generally numerous in materials, their
influence on the spin Berry curvature and, consequently, spin-charge
interconversion has often been overlooked. In this paper, we perform
spin-pumping experiments for stoichiometric SrRuO3 and non-stoichiometric
SrRu0.7O3 films at 300 K, where the films are in paramagnetic states, to
examine how Ru composition deviation from the stoichiometric condition
influences the spin-to-charge conversion, showing that SrRuO3 has a larger spin
Hall angle than SrRu0.7O3. We derive the band structures of paramagnetic SrRuO3
and SrRu0.75O3 using first-principles calculations, indicating that the spin
Hall conductivity originating from the spin Berry curvature decreases when the
Ru deficiency is incorporated, which agrees with the experimental results. Our
results suggest that point-defect- and impurity control is essential to fully
exploit the intrinsic spin Berry curvature and large spin-charge
interconversion function of materials. These insights help us with material
designs for efficient spin-charge interconversions.</p>

    <p>Molecular dynamics simulations are a crucial computational tool for
researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in
areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite
their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality
of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality
(iMD-VR) has recently been developed as a 'human-in-the-loop' strategy, which
leverages high-performance computing to accelerate the researcher's ability to
solve the hyperdimensional sampling problem. By providing an immersive 3D
environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular
motion, iMD-VR enables researchers and students to efficiently and intuitively
explore and navigate these complex, high-dimensional systems. iMD-VR platforms
offer a unique opportunity to quickly generate rich datasets that capture human

explores the possibility of employing user-generated iMD-VR datasets to train
AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL is an important technique in robotics
that enables agents to mimic complex behaviors from expert demonstrations, thus
circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. We
review the utilization of IL for manipulation tasks in robotics and discuss how
iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models for solving specific
molecular 'tasks'. We then investigate how such approaches could be applied to
the data captured from iMD-VR recordings. Finally, we outline the future
research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment
human expertise to efficiently navigate conformational spaces, highlighting how
this approach could provide valuable insight across domains such as materials
science, protein engineering, and computer-aided drug design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials design often relies on human-generated hypotheses, a process
inherently limited by cognitive constraints such as knowledge gaps and limited
ability to integrate and extract knowledge implications, particularly when
multidisciplinary expertise is required. This work demonstrates that large
language models (LLMs), coupled with prompt engineering, can effectively
generate non-trivial materials hypotheses by integrating scientific principles
from diverse sources without explicit design guidance by human experts. These
include design ideas for high-entropy alloys with superior cryogenic properties
and halide solid electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity and formability.
These design ideas have been experimentally validated in high-impact
publications in 2023 not available in the LLM training data, demonstrating the
LLM's ability to generate highly valuable and realizable innovative ideas not
established in the literature. Our approach primarily leverages materials
system charts encoding processing-structure-property relationships, enabling
more effective data integration by condensing key information from numerous
papers, and evaluation and categorization of numerous hypotheses for human
cognition, both through the LLM. This LLM-driven approach opens the door to new
avenues of artificial intelligence-driven materials discovery by accelerating
design, democratizing innovation, and expanding capabilities beyond the
designer's direct knowledge.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Discovering functional crystalline materials through computational methods
remains a formidable challenge in materials science. Here, we introduce
VQCrystal, an innovative deep learning framework that leverages discrete latent
representations to overcome key limitations in current approaches to crystal
generation and inverse design. VQCrystal employs a hierarchical VQ-VAE
architecture to encode global and atom-level crystal features, coupled with a
machine learning-based inter-atomic potential(IAP) model and a genetic
algorithm to realize property-targeted inverse design. Benchmark evaluations on
diverse datasets demonstrate VQCrystal's advanced capabilities in
representation learning and novel crystal discovery. Notably, VQCrystal
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.93\% force validity and a
Fr\'echet Distance of 0.152 on MP-20, indicating both strong validity and high
diversity in the sampling process. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we
apply VQCrystal for both 3D and 2D material design. For 3D materials, the
density-functional theory validation confirmed that 63.04\% of bandgaps and
99\% of formation energies of the 56 filtered materials matched the target
range. Moreover, 437 generated materials were validated as existing entries in
the full database outside the training set. For the discovery of 2D materials,
73.91\% of 23 filtered structures exhibited high stability with formation
energies below -1 eV/atom. Our results highlight VQCrystal's potential to
accelerate the discovery of novel materials with tailored properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Rare-earth oxides (REOs) are an important class of materials owing to their
unique properties, including high ionic conductivities, large dielectric
constants, and elevated melting temperatures, making them relevant to several
technological applications such as catalysis, ionic conduction, and sensing.
The ability to predict these properties at moderate computational cost is
essential to guiding materials discovery and optimizing materials performance.
Although density-functional theory (DFT) is the favored approach for predicting
electronic and atomic structures, its accuracy is limited in describing strong
electron correlation and localization inherent to REOs. The newly developed
strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized-gradient
approximations (meta-GGAs) promise improved accuracy in modeling these strongly
correlated systems. We assess the performance of these meta-GGAs on binary REOs
by comparing the numerical accuracy of thirteen exchange-correlation
approximations in predicting structural, magnetic, and electronic properties.
Hubbard U corrections for self-interaction errors and spin-orbit coupling are
systematically considered. Our comprehensive assessment offers insights into
the physical properties and functional performance of REOs predicted by
first-principles and provides valuable guidance for selecting optimal DFT
functionals for exploring these materials.</p>

    <p>A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable
of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains,
identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in
vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that
leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge
graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of
large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent
systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired
materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were
previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory
power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework
autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying
mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By
integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system
yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve
up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and

generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling,

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in
fields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of
fine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical
capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining
(CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization
approaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio
Preference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis
shows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the
merging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities
that surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that
model merging leads to new functionalities that neither parent model could
achieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments.
Experiments with different model architectures are presented, including Llama
3.1 8B and Mistral 7B models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring
whether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with
1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature
emergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be
a key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a
human and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how
different model variants perform and show that the smallest model achieves a
high intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth,
creativity, clarity, and quantitative precision. Other experiments include the
development of image generation prompts based on disparate biological material
design concepts, to create new microstructures, architectural concepts, and

    <p>Conway's Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class
of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme
sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate
behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology
presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that
can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We
develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to solve
this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with
no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions
(LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and
our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic
rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given
sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an
`autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our
results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large
language model framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural
language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the
evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs
could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by
extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create
new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields
of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</p>

    <p>The design of fusion devices is typically based on computationally expensive
simulations. This can be alleviated using high aspect ratio models that employ
a reduced number of free parameters, especially in the case of stellarator
optimization where non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with a large parameter
space are optimized to satisfy certain performance criteria. However,
optimization is still required to find configurations with properties such as
low elongation, high rotational transform, finite plasma beta, and good fast
particle confinement. In this work, we train a machine learning model to
construct configurations with favorable confinement properties by finding a
solution to the inverse design problem, that is, obtaining a set of model input
parameters for given desired properties. Since the solution of the inverse
problem is non-unique, a probabilistic approach, based on mixture density
networks, is used. It is shown that optimized configurations can be generated
reliably using this method.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Metasurfaces, capable of manipulating light at subwavelength scales, hold
great potential for advancing optoelectronic applications. Generative models,
particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offer a promising approach
for metasurface inverse design by efficiently navigating complex design spaces
and capturing underlying data patterns. However, existing generative models
struggle to achieve high electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity.
These challenges arise from the lack of explicit electromagnetic constraints
during training, which hinders accurate structure-to-electromagnetic response
mapping, and the absence of mechanisms to handle one-to-many mappings dilemma,
resulting in insufficient structural diversity. To address these issues, we
propose the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), a novel
framework that improves both electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity.
To achieve high electromagnetic fidelity, AcGAN proposes the Spectral Overlap
Coefficient (SOC) for precise spectral fidelity assessment and develops
AnchorNet, which provides real-time feedback on electromagnetic performance to
refine the structure-to-electromagnetic mapping. To enhance structural
diversity, AcGAN incorporates a cluster-guided controller that refines input
processing and ensures multi-level spectral integration, guiding the generation
process to explore multiple configurations for the same spectral target.
Additionally, a dynamic loss function progressively shifts the focus from
data-driven learning to optimizing both spectral fidelity and structural
diversity. Empirical analysis shows that AcGAN reduces the Mean Squared Error
(MSE) by 73% compared to current state-of-the-art GANs methods and
significantly expands the design space to generate diverse metasurface
architectures that meet precise spectral demands.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Auxetic structures, known for their negative Poisson's ratio, exhibit
effective elastic properties heavily influenced by their underlying structural
geometry and base material properties. While periodic homogenization of auxetic
unit cells can be used to investigate these properties, it is computationally
expensive and limits design space exploration and inverse analysis. In this
paper, surrogate models are developed for the real-time prediction of the
effective elastic properties of auxetic unit cells with orthogonal voids of
different shapes. The unit cells feature orthogonal voids in four distinct
shapes, including rectangular, diamond, oval, and peanut-shaped voids, each
characterized by specific void diameters. The generated surrogate models accept
geometric parameters and the elastic properties of the base material as inputs
to predict the effective elastic constants in real-time. This rapid evaluation
enables a practical inverse analysis framework for obtaining the optimal design
parameters that yield the desired effective response. The fast Fourier
transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach is adopted to efficiently
generate data for developing the surrogate models, bypassing concerns about
periodic mesh generation and boundary conditions typically associated with the
finite element method (FEM). The performance of the generated surrogate models
is rigorously examined through a train/test split methodology, a parametric
study, and an inverse problem. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) is
developed, offering real-time prediction of the effective tangent stiffness and
performing inverse analysis to determine optimal geometric parameters.</p>

    <p>Molecular property prediction and generative design via deep learning models
has been the subject of intense research given its potential to accelerate

have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models
(LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models

Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such
as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval
augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design,
has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained

show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal

machine learning approaches for inverse design that can predict
higher-resolution solutions from lower cost/resolution ones. Due to the recent
success of diffusion models over traditional generative models, we extend the
use of diffusion models for multi-resolution tasks by proposing the conditional
cascaded diffusion model (cCDM). Compared to GANs, cCDM is more stable to
train, and each diffusion model within the cCDM can be trained independently,
thus each model's parameters can be tuned separately to maximize the
performance of the pipeline. Our study compares cCDM against a cGAN model with
transfer learning.
  Our results demonstrate that the cCDM excels in capturing finer details,
preserving volume fraction constraints, and minimizing compliance errors in
multi-resolution tasks when a sufficient amount of high-resolution training
data (more than 102 designs) is available. Furthermore, we explore the impact
of training data size on the performance of both models. While both models show
decreased performance with reduced high-resolution training data, the cCDM
loses its superiority to the cGAN model with transfer learning when training
data is limited (less than 102), and we show the break-even point for this
transition. Also, we highlight that while the diffusion model may achieve
better pixel-wise performance in both low-resolution and high-resolution
scenarios, this does not necessarily guarantee that the model produces optimal
compliance error or constraint satisfaction.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an
unknown function to predict values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics,
predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance
that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions.
However, over-parameterized models exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as
"double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing
generalization error. Others may exhibit more complicated patterns of
predictive error with multiple peaks and valleys. Neither double descent nor
multiple descent phenomena are well explained by the bias-variance
decomposition.
  We introduce a novel decomposition that we call the generalized aliasing
decomposition (GAD) to explain the relationship between predictive performance
and model complexity. The GAD decomposes the predictive error into three parts:
1) model insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much
smaller than the number of data points, 2) data insufficiency, which dominates
when the number of parameters is much greater than the number of data points,
and 3) generalized aliasing, which dominates between these two extremes.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the GAD to diverse applications,
including random feature models from machine learning, Fourier transforms from
signal processing, solution methods for differential equations, and predictive
formation enthalpy in materials discovery. Because key components of the GAD
can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and
samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to
experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing
experiments. We further demonstrate this approach on several examples and
discuss implications for predictive modeling and data science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties represents a
formidable challenge in materials science. Although recent generative models
have demonstrated potential, their adoption has been hindered by limitations
such as inefficiency, architectural constraints and restricted open-source
availability. The representation of crystal structures using the SLICES
(Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) notation as a string of
characters enables the use of state-of-the-art natural language processing
models, such as Transformers, for crystal design. Drawing inspiration from the
success of GPT models in generating coherent text, we trained a generative
Transformer on the next-token prediction task to generate solid-state materials
with targeted properties. We demonstrate MatterGPT's capability to generate de
novo crystal structures with targeted single properties, including both
lattice-insensitive (formation energy) and lattice-sensitive (band gap)
properties. Furthermore, we extend MatterGPT to simultaneously target multiple
properties, addressing the complex challenge of multi-objective inverse design
of crystals. Our approach showcases high validity, uniqueness, and novelty in
generated structures, as well as the ability to generate materials with
properties beyond the training data distribution. This work represents a
significant step forward in computational materials discovery, offering a
powerful and open tool for designing materials with tailored properties for
various applications in energy, electronics, and beyond.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative models hold the promise of significantly expediting the materials
design process when compared to traditional human-guided or rule-based
methodologies. However, effectively generating high-quality periodic structures
of materials on limited but diverse datasets remains an ongoing challenge. Here
we propose a novel approach for periodic structure generation which fully
respect the intrinsic symmetries, periodicity, and invariances of the structure
space. Namely, we utilize differentiable, physics-based, structural descriptors
which can describe periodic systems and satisfy the necessary invariances, in
conjunction with a denoising diffusion model which generates new materials
within this descriptor or representation space. Reconstruction is then
performed on these representations using gradient-based optimization to recover
the corresponding Cartesian positions of the crystal structure. This approach
differs significantly from current methods by generating materials in the
representation space, rather than in the Cartesian space, which is made
possible using an efficient reconstruction algorithm. Consequently, known
issues with respecting periodic boundaries and translational and rotational
invariances during generation can be avoided, and the model training process
can be greatly simplified. We show this approach is able to provide competitive
performance on established benchmarks compared to current state-of-the-art
methods.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Ventilated acoustic resonator(VAR), a type of acoustic metamaterial, emerge
as an alternative for sound attenuation in environments that require
ventilation, owing to its excellent low-frequency attenuation performance and
flexible shape adaptability. However, due to the non-linear acoustic responses
of VARs, the VAR designs are generally obtained within a limited parametrized
design space, and the design relies on the iteration of the numerical
simulation which consumes a considerable amount of computational time and
resources. This paper proposes an acoustic response-encoded variational
autoencoder (AR-VAE), a novel variational autoencoder-based generative design
model for the efficient and accurate inverse design of VAR even with
non-parametrized designs. The AR-VAE matches the high-dimensional acoustic
response with the VAR cross-section image in the dimension-reduced latent
space, which enables the AR-VAE to generate various non-parametrized VAR
cross-section images with the target acoustic response. AR-VAE generates
non-parameterized VARs from target acoustic responses, which show a 25-fold
reduction in mean squared error compared to conventional deep learning-based
parameter searching methods while exhibiting lower average mean squared error
and peak frequency variance. By combining the inverse-designed VARs by AR-VAE,
multi-cavity VAR was devised for broadband and multitarget peak frequency
attenuation. The proposed design method presents a new approach for structural
inverse-design with a high-dimensional non-linear physical response.</p>

    <p>Microscopy techniques have played vital roles in materials science, biology,
and nanotechnology, offering high-resolution imaging and detailed insights into
properties at nanoscale and atomic level. The automation of microscopy
experiments, in combination with machine learning approaches, is a
transformative advancement, offering increased efficiency, reproducibility, and
the capability to perform complex experiments. Our previous work on autonomous
experimentation with scanning probe microscopy (SPM) demonstrated an active
learning framework using deep kernel learning (DKL) for structure-property
relationship discovery. This approach has demonstrated broad applications in
various microscopy techniques. Here, to address limitations of workflows based
on DKL, we developed methods to incorporate prior knowledge and human interest
into DKL-based workflows and implemented these workflows in SPM. By integrating
expected rewards from structure libraries or spectroscopic features, we
enhanced the exploration efficiency of autonomous microscopy, demonstrating
more efficient and targeted exploration in autonomous microscopy. We
demonstrated the application of these methods in SPM, but we suggest that these
methods can be seamlessly applied to other microscopy and imaging techniques.
Furthermore, the concept can be adapted for general Bayesian optimization in
material discovery across a broad range of autonomous experimental fields.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Inverse material design is a cornerstone challenge in materials science, with
significant applications across many industries. Traditional approaches that
invert the structure-property (SP) linkage to identify microstructures with
targeted properties often overlook the feasibility of production processes,
leading to microstructures that may not be manufacturable. Achieving both
desired properties and a realizable manufacturing procedure necessitates
inverting the entire Process-Structure-Property (PSP) chain. However, this task
is fraught with challenges, including stochasticity along the whole modeling
chain, the high dimensionality of microstructures and process parameters, and
the inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem. This paper proposes a novel
framework, named PSP-GEN, for the goal-oriented material design that
effectively addresses these challenges by modeling the entire PSP chain with a
deep generative model. It employs two sets of continuous, microstructure- and
property-aware, latent variables, the first of which provides a
lower-dimensional representation that captures the stochastic aspects of
microstructure generation, while the second is a direct link to processing
parameters. This structured, low-dimensional embedding not only simplifies the
handling of high-dimensional microstructure data but also facilitates the
application of gradient-based optimization techniques. The effectiveness and
efficiency of this method are demonstrated in the inverse design of two-phase
materials, where the objective is to design microstructures with target
effective permeability. We compare state-of-the-art alternatives in challenging
settings involving limited training data, target property regions for which no
training data is available, and design tasks where the process parameters and
microstructures have high-dimensional representations.</p>

    <p>In recent times, the use of machine learning in materials design and
discovery has aided to accelerate the discovery of innovative materials with
extraordinary properties, which otherwise would have been driven by a laborious
and time-consuming trial-and-error process. In this study, a simple yet
powerful fragment-based descriptor, Low Dimensional Fragment Descriptors
(LDFD), is proposed to work in conjunction with machine learning models to
predict important properties of a wide range of inorganic materials such as
perovskite oxides, metal halide perovskites, alloys, semiconductor, and other
materials system and can also be extended to work with interfaces. To predict
properties, the generation of descriptors requires only the structural formula
of the materials and, in presence of identical structure in the dataset,
additional system properties as input. And the generation of descriptors
involves few steps, encoding the formula in binary space and reduction of
dimensionality, allowing easy implementation and prediction. To evaluate
descriptor performance, six known datasets with up to eight components were
compared. The method was applied to properties such as band gaps of perovskites
and semiconductors, lattice constant of magnetic alloys, bulk/shear modulus of
superhard alloys, critical temperature of superconductors, formation enthalpy
and energy above hull convex of perovskite oxides. An advanced python-based
data mining tool matminer was utilized for the collection of data. The
prediction accuracies are equivalent to the quality of the training data and
show comparable effectiveness as previous studies. This method should be
extendable to any inorganic material systems which can be subdivided into
layers or crystal structures with more than one atom site, and with the
progress of data mining the performance should get better with larger and
unbiased datasets.</p>

    <p>The design of alloys is a multi-scale problem that requires a holistic

we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of
multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment
to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative

(LLM) the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various

materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include
autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to
their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key

    <p>High-level synthesis (HLS) has significantly advanced the automation of
digital circuits design, yet the need for expertise and time in pragma tuning
remains challenging. Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE)
adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further
optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization
due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the
design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for
HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and
generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at
compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Chemical representation learning has gained increasing interest due to the
limited availability of supervised data in fields such as drug and materials
design. This interest particularly extends to chemical language representation
learning, which involves pre-training Transformers on SMILES sequences --
textual descriptors of molecules. Despite its success in molecular property
prediction, current practices often lead to overfitting and limited scalability
due to early convergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel chemical language
representation learning framework, called MolTRES, to address these issues.
MolTRES incorporates generator-discriminator training, allowing the model to
learn from more challenging examples that require structural understanding. In
addition, we enrich molecular representations by transferring knowledge from
scientific literature by integrating external materials embedding. Experimental
results show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on
popular molecular property prediction tasks.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Two-photon polymerization (2PP) 3D printing is a well-known technique for
fabricating passive micro/nanoscale structures, such as microlenses and
inversely designed polarization splitters. The integration of light emitting
nanoparticle (NP) dopants, such as quantum dots (QDs) and rare-earth doped
nanoparticles (RENPs), into a polymer resist would enable 3D printing of active
polymer micro-photonic devices, including sensors, lasers, and solid-state
displays. Many NPs are stabilized with oleic acid ligands to prevent
degradation, but oleate-capped NPs (oc-NPs) tend to agglomerate in nonpolar
media despite the hydrophobicity of the ligand. This results in an uneven
distribution of NPs in polymers and increased optical extinction properties. In
this work, we propose a general approach for dispersing various oc-NPs in
commercial 3D printable polymers. We achieve controlled growth of small carbon
chains around the oc-NPs by functionalizing the NPs with methyl-methacrylate
monomers. The proposed approach is validated on RENPs (~65 nm) and CdSe/ZnS
quantum dots (~12 nm) using different commercial polymer resists (IP-Dip and
IP-Visio). Dispersions of functionalized NPs (f-NPs) have improved NP density
by an order of magnitude and are shown to be stable for several weeks with
minimal impact on printing quality. Our approach is generalizable to a variety
of oc-NPs and ultimately leads to higher quality polymer-based optical and
electronic devices.</p>

    <p>As material modeling and simulation has become vital for modern materials
science, research data with distinctive physical principles and extensive

across all relevant scales. Effective workflow and data management, with
corresponding metadata descriptions, helps leverage the full potential of

propose a research workflow and data management (RWDM) framework to manage
complex workflows and resulting research (meta)data, while following FAIR
principles. Multiphysics multiscale simulations for additive manufacturing
investigations are treated as showcase and implemented on Kadi4Mat: an open
source research data infrastructure. The input and output data of the
simulations, together with the associated setups and scripts realizing the
simulation workflow, are curated in corresponding standardized Kadi4Mat records
with extendibility for further research and data-driven analyses. These records
are interlinked to indicate information flow and form an ontology based
knowledge graph. Automation scheme for performing high-throughput simulation
and post-processing integrated with the proposed RWDM framework is also

    <p>The inverse design of tailored organic molecules for specific optoelectronic
devices of high complexity holds an enormous potential, but has not yet been

molecular structures present both, an unprecedented opportunity for
technological breakthroughs as well as an unseen optimization challenge.
Current models rely on big data which do not exist for specialized research
films. However, a hybrid computational and high throughput experimental
screening workflow allowed us to train predictive models with as little as 149
molecules. We demonstrate a unique closed-loop workflow combining high
throughput synthesis and Bayesian optimization that discovers new hole
transporting materials with tailored properties for solar cell applications. A
series of high-performance molecules were identified from minimal suggestions,
achieving up to 26.23% (certified 25.88%) power conversion efficiency in
perovskite solar cells. Our work paves the way for rapid, informed discovery in
vast molecular libraries, revolutionizing material selection for complex

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Additively manufactured (AM) aluminum alloys with high strength and thermal
stability have broad applications in turbine engines, vacuum pumps, heat
exchangers, and many other industrial systems. Employing precipitates with an
L1$_2$ structure to block dislocation motions is a widespread strategy to
strengthen aluminum. However, to achieve high strength, a high volume fraction
of small precipitates is required, and these characteristics are generally
mutually exclusive. Here, we show that for certain compositions of Al alloys,
L1$_2$ phases initially precipitate as sub-micron metastable ternary phases
under the rapid solidification conditions of powder bed AM, yet the subsequent
L1$_2$ phases that precipitate during heat treatment of the sample remain at
the nanoscale, imparting high strength. For strength to be retained at elevated
temperature, these nanoprecipitates must have low coarsening rates. To
inversely design the composition of an alloy to have these target
microstructural features, we used hybrid calculation of phase diagram
(CALPHAD)-based integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and
Bayesian optimization techniques. We tested our approach by designing an
Al-Er-Zr-Y-Yb-Ni model alloy, and the selected composition was manufactured in
powder form as AM feedstock. The strength of specimens manufactured via laser
powder bed fusion (LPBF) from the designed composition is comparable to that of
wrought Al 7075, yet without cracking that occurs upon LPBF of Al 7075. After
high-temperature (400$^\circ$C) aging the designed alloy is 50% stronger than
the strongest known benchmark printable Al alloy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recent high-throughput computational searches have predicted many novel
ternary nitride compounds providing new opportunities for materials discovery
in under explored phase spaces. Nevertheless, there are hardly any predictions
and/or syntheses that incorporate only transition metals into new ternary
nitrides. Here, we report on the synthesis, structure, and properties of
MnCoN$_2$, a new ternary nitride material comprising only transition metals and
N. We find that crystalline MnCoN$_2$ can be stabilized over its competing
binaries, and over a tendency of this system to become amorphous, by
controlling growth temperature within a narrow window slightly above ambient
condition. We find that single-phase MnCoN$_2$ thin films form in a
cation-disordered rocksalt crystal structure, which is supported by ab-initio
calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that MnCoN$_2$
is sensitive to oxygen through various oxides and hydroxides binding to cobalt
on the surface. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to verify that Mn$^{3+}$
and Co$^{3+}$ cations exist in an octahedrally-coordinated environment, which
is distinct from a combination of CoN and MnN binaries and in agreement with
the rocksalt-based crystal structure prediction. Magnetic measurements suggest
that MnCoN$_2$ has a canted antiferromagnetic ground state below 10 K. We
extract a Weiss temperature of $\theta$ = -49.7 K, highlighting the
antiferromagnetic correlations in MnCoN$_2$.</p>

    <p>Discovering new materials can have significant scientific and technological
implications but remains a challenging problem today due to the enormity of the
chemical space. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven
methods to rapidly screen or generate promising materials, but these methods
still depend heavily on very large quantities of training data and often lack
the flexibility and chemical understanding often desired in materials
discovery. We introduce LLMatDesign, a novel language-based framework for
interpretable materials design powered by large language models (LLMs).
LLMatDesign utilizes LLM agents to translate human instructions, apply
modifications to materials, and evaluate outcomes using provided tools. By
incorporating self-reflection on its previous decisions, LLMatDesign adapts
rapidly to new tasks and conditions in a zero-shot manner. A systematic
evaluation of LLMatDesign on several materials design tasks, in silico,
validates LLMatDesign's effectiveness in developing new materials with
user-defined target properties in the small data regime. Our framework
demonstrates the remarkable potential of autonomous LLM-guided materials

    <p>Overcoming the challenge of limited data availability within materials
science is crucial for the broad-based applicability of machine learning within
materials science. One pathway to overcome this limited data availability is to
use the framework of transfer learning (TL), where a pre-trained (PT) machine
learning model (on a larger dataset) can be fine-tuned (FT) on a target
(typically smaller) dataset. Our study systematically explores the
effectiveness of various PT/FT strategies to learn and predict material
properties with limited data. Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks
(GNNs) to PT/FT on seven diverse curated materials datasets, encompassing sizes
ranging from 941 to 132,752 datapoints. We consider datasets that cover a
spectrum of material properties, ranging from band gaps (electronic) to
formation energies (thermodynamic) and shear moduli (mechanical). We study the
influence of PT and FT dataset sizes, strategies that can be employed for FT,
and other hyperparameters on pair-wise TL among the datasets considered. We
find our pair-wise PT-FT models to consistently outperform models trained from
scratch on the target datasets. Importantly, we develop a GNN framework that is
simultaneously PT on multiple properties (MPT), enabling the construction of
generalized GNN models. Our MPT models outperform pair-wise PT-FT models on
several datasets considered, and more significantly, on a 2D material band gap
dataset that is completely out-of-distribution from the PT datasets. Finally,
we expect our PT/FT and MPT frameworks to be generalizable to other GNNs and
materials properties, which can accelerate materials design and discovery for
various applications.</p>

    <p>Realizing large materials models has emerged as a critical endeavor for

in predicting material properties. We further showcase a promising application
of fine-tuning universal materials models for enhancing specific materials

    <p>Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the generation of realistic
data by training generative models on large datasets of text, images, and
audio. While these models have demonstrated exceptional performance in
generating novel and plausible data, it remains an open question whether they
can effectively accelerate scientific discovery through the data generation and
drive significant advancements across various scientific fields. In particular,
the discovery of new inorganic materials with promising properties poses a
critical challenge, both scientifically and for industrial applications.
However, unlike textual or image data, materials, or more specifically crystal
structures, consist of multiple types of variables - including lattice vectors,
atom positions, and atomic species. This complexity in data give rise to a
variety of approaches for representing and generating such data. Consequently,
the design choices of generative models for crystal structures remain an open
question. In this study, we explore a new type of diffusion model for the
generative inverse design of crystal structures, with a backbone based on a
Transformer architecture. We demonstrate our models are superior to previous
methods in their versatility for generating crystal structures with desired
properties. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that the optimal
conditioning methods vary depending on the dataset.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Aqueous batteries play an increasingly important role for the development of
sustainable and safety-prioritised energy storage solutions. Compared to
conventional lithium-ion batteries, the cell chemistry in aqueous batteries
share many common features with those of electrolyzer and pseudo-capacitor
systems because of the involvement of aqueous electrolyte and proton activity.
This imposes the needs for a better understanding of the corresponding ion
solvation, intercalation and electron transfer processes at atomistic scale.
Therefore, this chapter provides an up-to-date overview of molecular modelling
techniques and their applications in aqueous batteries. In particular, we
emphasize on the dynamical and reactive description of aqueous battery systems
brought in by density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulation
(DFTMD) and its machine-learning (ML) accelerated counterpart. Moreover, we
also cover the recent advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in
molecular and materials design of aqueous batteries. Case studies presented
here include popular aqueous battery systems, such as water-in-salt
electrolytes, proton-coupled cathode materials, Zn-ion batteries as well as
organic redox flow batteries.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Molecule inverse folding has been a long-standing challenge in chemistry and
biology, with the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and material
science. Despite specified models have been proposed for different small- or
macro-molecules, few have attempted to unify the learning process, resulting in
redundant efforts. Complementary to recent advancements in molecular structure
prediction, such as RoseTTAFold All-Atom and AlphaFold3, we propose the unified
model UniIF for the inverse folding of all molecules. We do such unification in
two levels: 1) Data-Level: We propose a unified block graph data form for all
molecules, including the local frame building and geometric feature
initialization. 2) Model-Level: We introduce a geometric block attention
network, comprising a geometric interaction, interactive attention and virtual
long-term dependency modules, to capture the 3D interactions of all molecules.
Through comprehensive evaluations across various tasks such as protein design,
RNA design, and material design, we demonstrate that our proposed method
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all tasks. UniIF offers a versatile and
effective solution for general molecule inverse folding.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Directly generating material structures with optimal properties is a
long-standing goal in material design. One of the fundamental challenges lies
in how to overcome the limitation of traditional generative models to
efficiently explore the global chemical space rather than a small localized
space. Herein, we develop a framework named MAGECS to address this dilemma, by
integrating the bird swarm algorithm and supervised graph neural network to
effectively navigate the generative model in the immense chemical space towards
materials with target properties. As a demonstration, MAGECS is applied to
design compelling alloy electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction reaction
(CO$_2$RR) and works extremely well. Specifically, the chemical space of
CO$_2$RR is effectively explored, where over 250,000 promising structures with
high activity have been generated and notably, the proportion of desired
structures is 2.5-fold increased. Moreover, five predicted alloys, i.e., CuAl,
AlPd, Sn$_2$Pd$_5$, Sn$_9$Pd$_7$, and CuAlSe$_2$ are successfully synthesized
and characterized experimentally, two of which exhibit about 90% Faraday
efficiency of CO$_2$RR, and CuAl achieved 76% efficiency for C$_2$ products.
This pioneering application of inverse design in CO$_2$RR catalysis showcases
the potential of MAGECS to dramatically accelerate the development of
functional materials, paving the way for fully automated, artificial
intelligence-driven material design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Simulation is a powerful tool to better understand physical systems, but
generally requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Downstream
applications of such simulations can become computationally infeasible if they
require many forward solves, for example in the case of inverse design with
many degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate and extend neural PDE
solvers as a tool to aid in scaling simulations for two-phase flow problems,
and simulations of oil expulsion from a pore specifically. We extend existing
numerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying
geometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we
investigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN,
and U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem:
(1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3)
approximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their
speed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an
ablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the
droplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our
extensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced
varying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the
previously considered oil expulsion problem.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work, methods are presented to automatically generate a fully
atomistic LAMMPS models of arbitrary linear multiblock polyurethane copolymers.
The routine detailed here receives as parameters the number of repeat units per
hard block, the number of units in a soft block, and the number of soft blocks
per chain, as well as chemical formulae of three monomers which will form the
hard component, soft component, and chain extender. A routine is detailed for
converting the chemical structure of a free monomer to the urethane bonded
repeat units in a polymer. The python package RadonPy is leveraged to assemble
these units into blocks, and the blocks into copolymers. Care is taken in this
work to ensure that plausible atomic charges are assigned to repeat units in
different parts of the chain. The static structure factor is calculated for a
variety of chemistries, and the results compared with wide angle x-ray
scattering data from experiments with corresponding composition. The generated
models reproduce the amorphous halo observed in the scattering data as well as
some of the finer details. Structure factor calculations are decomposed into
the partial structure factors to interrogate the structural properties of the
two block types separately. Parametric surveys are carried out of the effects
of various parameters, including temperature, soft block length, and block
connectivity on the observed structure. The routine detailed here for
constructing models is robust enough to be executed automatically in a high
throughput workflow for material design and discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystalline alloys and related mixed systems make up a large family of
materials with high tunability which have been proposed as the solution to a
large number of energy related materials design problems. Due to the presence
of chemical order and disorder in these systems, neither experimental efforts
nor ab-initio computational methods alone are sufficient to span the inherently
large configuration space. Therefore, fast and accurate models are necessary.
To this end, cluster expansions have been widely and successfully used for the
past decades. Cluster expansions are generalized Ising models designed to
predict the energy of any atomic configuration of a system after training on a
small subset of the available configurations. Constructing and sampling a
cluster expansion consists of multiple steps that have to be performed with
care. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive guide to this process,
highlighting important considerations and potential pitfalls. The tutorial
consists of three parts, starting with cluster expansion construction for a
relatively simple system, continuing with strategies for more challenging
systems such as surfaces and closing with examples of Monte Carlo sampling of
cluster expansions to study order-disorder transitions and phase diagrams.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective
function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span
various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular
engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using
existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new
designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model.
This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate
model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based
Optimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly
optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing
gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design
candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be
invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this
challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates,
we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We
introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them
with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with
the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO
tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is
competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.</p>

    <p>In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language
processing (QNLP) to inverse design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with
targeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 450 hypothetical MOF structures
consisting of 3 topologies, 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we
categorize these structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and
$CO_{2}$ Henry's constant values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the
bag-of-words, DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical), and
sequence-based models) to identify the most effective approach to process the
MOF dataset. Using a classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the
bag-of-words model is identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation
accuracies of 88.6% and 78.0% for binary classification tasks on pore volume
and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Further, we developed multi-class
classification models tailored to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits,
with average test accuracies of 92% and 80% across different classes for pore
volume and $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant datasets. Finally, the performance of
generating MOF with target properties showed accuracies of 93.5% for pore
volume and 87% for $CO_{2}$ Henry's constant, respectively. Although our
investigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF search space, it marks a
promising first step towards using quantum computing for materials design,
offering a new perspective through which to explore the complex landscape of
MOFs.</p>

    <p>Combinatorial and guided screening of materials space with density-functional
theory and related approaches has provided a wealth of hypothetical inorganic
materials, which are increasingly tabulated in open databases. The OPTIMADE API
is a standardised format for representing crystal structures, their measured
and computed properties, and the methods for querying and filtering them from
remote resources. Currently, the OPTIMADE federation spans over 20 data
providers, rendering over 30 million structures accessible in this way, many of
which are novel and have only recently been suggested by machine learning-based
approaches. In this work, we outline our approach to non-exhaustively screen
this dynamic trove of structures for the next-generation of optical materials.
By applying MODNet, a neural network-based model for property prediction,
within a combined active learning and high-throughput computation framework, we
isolate particular structures and chemistries that should be most fruitful for
further theoretical calculations and for experimental study as
high-refractive-index materials. By making explicit use of automated
calculations, federated dataset curation and machine learning, and by releasing
these publicly, the workflows presented here can be periodically re-assessed as
new databases implement OPTIMADE, and new hypothetical materials are suggested.</p>

Density Functional Theory (DFT) with range-separated hybrid functionals, we
examine 30 MX$_2$ combinations, revealing how stacking and composition
influence stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$
heterostructure with a 60\textdegree~shift maintains a direct band gap,
highlighting its potential for applications. Homobilayers under low-strain
conditions exhibit diverse stacking-dependent electronic behaviors, where
MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ transition between direct and indirect band gaps
at specific twist angles. MoS$_2$ can even switch between semiconductor and
metallic states. Critical twist angles (17.9\textdegree, 42.1\textdegree,
77.9\textdegree, and 102.1\textdegree) in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers

    <p>Deep Learning has been a critical part of designing inverse design methods
that are computationally efficient and accurate. An example of this is the
design of photonic metasurfaces by using their photoluminescent spectrum as the
input data to predict their topology. One fundamental challenge of these
systems is their ability to represent nonlinear relationships between sets of
data that have different dimensionalities. Existing design methods often
implement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network in order to solve this
problem, but in many cases the solution is unable to generate structures that
provide multiple peaks when validated. It is demonstrated that in response to
the target spectrum, the Bidirectional Adversarial Autoencoder is able to
generate structures that provide multiple peaks on several occasions. As a
result the proposed model represents an important advance towards the
generation of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces that can be used in advanced
metasurface design.</p>

    <p>Recent progress of deep generative models in the vision and language domain
has stimulated significant interest in more structured data generation such as
molecules. However, beyond generating new random molecules, efficient
exploration and a comprehensive understanding of the vast chemical space are of
great importance to molecular science and applications in drug design and
materials discovery. In this paper, we propose a new framework, ChemFlow, to
traverse chemical space through navigating the latent space learned by molecule
generative models through flows. We introduce a dynamical system perspective
that formulates the problem as learning a vector field that transports the mass
of the molecular distribution to the region with desired molecular properties
or structure diversity. Under this framework, we unify previous approaches on
molecule latent space traversal and optimization and propose alternative
competing methods incorporating different physical priors. We validate the
efficacy of ChemFlow on molecule manipulation and single- and multi-objective
molecule optimization tasks under both supervised and unsupervised molecular
discovery settings. Codes and demos are publicly available on GitHub at

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Large language models (LLMs) such as generative pretrained transformers
(GPTs) have shown potential for various commercial applications, but their
applicability for materials design remains underexplored. In this article, we
introduce AtomGPT, a model specifically developed for materials design based on
transformer architectures, to demonstrate the capability for both atomistic
property prediction and structure generation. We show that a combination of
chemical and structural text descriptions can efficiently predict material
properties with accuracy comparable to graph neural network models, including
formation energies, electronic bandgaps from two different methods and
superconducting transition temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
AtomGPT can generate atomic structures for tasks such as designing new
superconductors, with the predictions validated through density functional
theory calculations. This work paves the way for leveraging LLMs in forward and
inverse materials design, offering an efficient approach to the discovery and
optimization of materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Deep generative models have been accelerating the inverse design process in
material and drug design. Unlike their counterpart property predictors in
typical molecular design frameworks, generative molecular design models have
seen fewer efforts on uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to computational
challenges in Bayesian inference posed by their large number of parameters. In
this work, we focus on the junction-tree variational autoencoder (JT-VAE), a
popular model for generative molecular design, and address this issue by
leveraging the low dimensional active subspace to capture the uncertainty in
the model parameters. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution
over the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty
in an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does
not require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable
to any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the
AS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the
model diversity under epistemic uncertainty.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Procedural noise is a fundamental component of computer graphics pipelines,
offering a flexible way to generate textures that exhibit "natural" random
variation. Many different types of noise exist, each produced by a separate
algorithm. In this paper, we present a single generative model which can learn
to generate multiple types of noise as well as blend between them. In addition,
it is capable of producing spatially-varying noise blends despite not having
access to such data for training. These features are enabled by training a
denoising diffusion model using a novel combination of data augmentation and
network conditioning techniques. Like procedural noise generators, the model's
behavior is controllable via interpretable parameters and a source of
randomness. We use our model to produce a variety of visually compelling noise
textures. We also present an application of our model to improving inverse
procedural material design; using our model in place of fixed-type noise nodes
in a procedural material graph results in higher-fidelity material
reconstructions without needing to know the type of noise in advance.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular
structures that lead to outstanding mechanical properties, like high
stiffness-to-weight ratios and good energy absorption. To reproduce these
properties in synthetic materials, biomimicry typically replicates the
irregular natural structure, often leading to fabrication challenges. Here, we
present a bioinspired material design method that instead reduces the irregular
natural structure to a finite set of building blocks, also known as tiles, and
rules to connect them, and then uses these elements as instructions to generate
synthetic materials with mechanical properties similar to the biological
materials. We demonstrate the method using the pericarp of the orange, a member
of the citrus family known for its protective, energy-absorbing capabilities.
We generate polymer samples and characterize them under quasi-static and
dynamic compression and observe spatially-varying stiffness and good energy
absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and
connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, we determine how to
spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.</p>

    <p>Gas separation using polymer membranes promises to dramatically drive down
the energy, carbon, and water intensity of traditional thermally driven
separation, but developing the membrane materials is challenging. Here, we
demonstrate a novel graph machine learning (ML) strategy to guide the
experimental discovery of synthesizable polymer membranes with performances
simultaneously exceeding the empirical upper bounds in multiple industrially
important gas separation tasks. Two predicted candidates are synthesized and
experimentally validated to perform beyond the upper bounds for multiple gas
pairs (O2/N2, H2/CH4, and H2/N2). Notably, the O2/N2 separation selectivity is
1.6-6.7 times higher than existing polymer membranes. The molecular origin of
the high performance is revealed by combining the inherent interpretability of
our ML model, experimental characterization, and molecule-level simulation. Our
study presents a unique explainable ML-experiment combination to tackle
challenging energy material design problems in general, and the discovered
polymers are beneficial for industrial gas separation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The longitudinal nonreciprocal charge transport (NCT) in crystalline
materials is a highly non-trivial phenomenon, motivating the design of next
generation two-terminal rectification devices (e.g., semiconductor diodes
beyond PN junctions). The practical application of such devices is built upon
crystalline materials whose longitudinal NCT occurs at room temperature and
under low magnetic field. However, materials of this type are rather rare and
elusive, and theory guiding the discovery of these materials is lacking. Here,
we develop such a theory within the framework of semiclassical Boltzmann
transport theory. By symmetry analysis, we classify the complete 122 magnetic
point groups with respect to the longitudinal NCT phenomenon. The
symmetry-adapted Hamiltonian analysis further uncovers a previously overlooked
mechanism for this phenomenon. Our theory guides the first-principles
prediction of longitudinal NCT in multiferroic \epsilon-Fe2O3 semiconductor
that possibly occurs at room temperature, without the application of external
magnetic field. These findings advance our fundamental understandings of
longitudinal NCT in crystalline materials, and aid the corresponding materials
discoveries.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative models have received significant attention in recent years for
materials science applications, particularly in the area of inverse design for
materials discovery. However, these models are usually assessed based on newly
generated, unverified materials, which provide a narrow evaluation of a model's
performance. Also, current efforts for inorganic materials have predominantly
focused on small crystals, even though the capability to generate large
disordered structures would significantly expand the applicability of
generative modeling. In this work, we present the Disordered Materials &
Interfaces Benchmark (Dismai-Bench), a generative model benchmark that uses
datasets of disordered alloys, interfaces, and amorphous silicon (256-264 atoms
per structure). Models are trained on each dataset independently, and evaluated
through direct structural comparisons between training and generated
structures. Benchmarking was performed on two graph diffusion models and two
(coordinate-based) U-Net diffusion models. The graph models were found to
significantly outperform the U-Net models due to the higher expressive power of
graphs. While noise in the less expressive models can assist in discovering
materials by facilitating exploration beyond the training distribution, these
models face significant challenges when confronted with more complex
structures. To further demonstrate the benefits of this benchmarking in the
development process of a generative model, we considered the case of developing
a point-cloud-based generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate low-energy
disordered interfaces. We show that the best performing architecture, CryinGAN,
outperforms the U-Net models, and is competitive against the graph models
despite its lack of invariances and weaker expressive power. This work provides
a new framework and insights to guide the development of future generative
models.</p>

    <p>Subwavelength photonic structures and metamaterials provide revolutionary
approaches for controlling light. The inverse design methods proposed for these
subwavelength structures are vital to the development of new photonic devices.
However, most of the existing inverse design methods cannot realize direct
mapping from optical properties to photonic structures but instead rely on
forward simulation methods to perform iterative optimization. In this work, we
exploit the powerful generative abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and
propose a practical inverse design method based on latent diffusion models. Our
method maps directly the optical properties to structures without the
requirement of forward simulation and iterative optimization. Here, the given
optical properties can work as "prompts" and guide the constructed model to
correctly "draw" the required photonic structures. Experiments show that our
direct mapping-based inverse design method can generate subwavelength photonic
structures at high fidelity while following the given optical properties. This
may change the method used for optical design and greatly accelerate the
research on new photonic devices.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets or GFNs) are probabilistic models
predicated on Markov flows, and they employ specific amortization algorithms to
learn stochastic policies that generate compositional substances including
biomolecules, chemical materials, etc. With a strong ability to generate
high-performance biochemical molecules, GFNs accelerate the discovery of
scientific substances, effectively overcoming the time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and costly shortcomings of conventional material discovery
methods. However, previous studies rarely focus on accumulating exploratory
experience by adjusting generative structures, which leads to disorientation in
complex sampling spaces. Efforts to address this issue, such as LS-GFN, are
limited to local greedy searches and lack broader global adjustments. This
paper introduces a novel variant of GFNs, the Dynamic Backtracking GFN
(DB-GFN), which improves the adaptability of decision-making steps through a
reward-based dynamic backtracking mechanism. DB-GFN allows backtracking during
the network construction process according to the current state's reward value,
thereby correcting disadvantageous decisions and exploring alternative pathways
during the exploration process. When applied to generative tasks involving
biochemical molecules and genetic material sequences, DB-GFN outperforms GFN
models such as LS-GFN and GTB, as well as traditional reinforcement learning
methods, in sample quality, sample exploration quantity, and training
convergence speed. Additionally, owing to its orthogonal nature, DB-GFN shows
great potential in future improvements of GFNs, and it can be integrated with
other strategies to achieve higher search performance.</p>

    <p>There is growing interest in engineering unconventional computing devices
that leverage the intrinsic dynamics of physical substrates to perform fast and
energy-efficient computations. Granular metamaterials are one such substrate
that has emerged as a promising platform for building wave-based information
processing devices with the potential to integrate sensing, actuation, and
computation. Their high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics result in nontrivial
and sometimes counter-intuitive wave responses that can be shaped by the
material properties, geometry, and configuration of individual grains. Such
highly tunable rich dynamics can be utilized for mechanical computing in
special-purpose applications. However, there are currently no general
frameworks for the inverse design of large-scale granular materials. Here, we
build upon the similarity between the spatiotemporal dynamics of wave
propagation in material and the computational dynamics of Recurrent Neural
Networks to develop a gradient-based optimization framework for harmonically
driven granular crystals. We showcase how our framework can be utilized to
design basic logic gates where mechanical vibrations carry the information at
predetermined frequencies. We compare our design methodology with classic
gradient-free methods and find that our approach discovers higher-performing
configurations with less computational effort. Our findings show that a
gradient-based optimization method can greatly expand the design space of
metamaterials and provide the opportunity to systematically traverse the

    <p>In computational molecular and materials science, determining equilibrium
structures is the crucial first step for accurate subsequent property
calculations. However, the recent discovery of millions of new crystals and
complex twisted structures has challenged traditional computational methods,
both ab initio and machine-learning-based, due to their computationally

introduce DeepRelax, a deep generative model capable of performing geometric
crystal structure relaxation rapidly and without iterations. DeepRelax learns
the equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it to predict relaxed
structures directly from their unrelaxed ones. The ability to perform
structural relaxation at the millisecond level per structure, combined with the
scalability of parallel processing, makes DeepRelax particularly useful for
large-scale virtual screening. We demonstrate DeepRelax's reliability and
robustness by applying it to five diverse databases, including oxides,
Materials Project, two-dimensional materials, van der Waals crystals, and
crystals with point defects. DeepRelax consistently shows high accuracy and
efficiency, validated by density functional theory calculations. Finally, we
enhance its trustworthiness by integrating uncertainty quantification. This
work significantly accelerates computational workflows, offering a robust and
trustworthy machine-learning method for material discovery and advancing the
application of AI for science. Code for DeepRelax is available at

allows non-recurrent supervision on and prediction of intermediate physical

data-generation cost. Using this O(1)-time intermediate prediction capability,
we propose and prove a rigorous, efficiently computable upper bound on
prediction error, allowing accuracy guarantees at inference time for all
predictions. After training solely on randomized systems, we demonstrate the
unified model across a suite of challenging multi-disciplinary inverse
problems, finding strong efficacy and speed improvements up to 96% for problems
in optical tomography, beam shaping through volumetric random media, and
freeform photonic inverse design, with no problem-specific training. Our

    <p>We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model
specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline

greatly reduces the effective complexity of crystal space, which is essential

Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>High-entropy materials (HEMs) have recently emerged as a significant category
of materials, offering highly tunable properties. However, the scarcity of HEM
data in existing density functional theory (DFT) databases, primarily due to
computational expense, hinders the development of effective modeling strategies
for computational materials discovery. In this study, we introduce an open DFT
dataset of alloys and employ machine learning (ML) methods to investigate the
material representations needed for HEM modeling. Utilizing high-throughput DFT
calculations, we generate a comprehensive dataset of 84k structures,
encompassing both ordered and disordered alloys across a spectrum of up to
seven components and the entire compositional range. We apply descriptor-based
models and graph neural networks to assess how material information is captured
across diverse chemical-structural representations. We first evaluate the
in-distribution performance of ML models to confirm their predictive accuracy.
Subsequently, we demonstrate the capability of ML models to generalize between
ordered and disordered structures, between low-order and high-order alloys, and
between equimolar and non-equimolar compositions. Our findings suggest that ML
models can generalize from cost-effective calculations of simpler systems to
more complex scenarios. Additionally, we discuss the influence of dataset size
and reveal that the information loss associated with the use of unrelaxed
structures could significantly degrade the generalization performance. Overall,
this research sheds light on several critical aspects of HEM modeling and
offers insights for data-driven atomistic modeling of HEMs.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials design aims to discover novel compounds with desired properties.
However, prevailing strategies face critical trade-offs. Conventional
element-substitution approaches readily and adaptively incorporate various
domain knowledge but remain confined to a narrow search space. In contrast,
deep generative models efficiently explore vast compositional landscapes, yet
they struggle to flexibly integrate domain knowledge. To address these
trade-offs, we propose a gradient-based material design framework that combines
these strengths, offering both efficiency and adaptability. In our method,
chemical compositions are optimised to achieve target properties by using
property prediction models and their gradients. In order to seamlessly enforce
diverse constraints, including those reflecting domain insights such as
oxidation states, discretised compositional ratios, types of elements, and
their abundance, we apply masks and employ a special loss function, namely the
integer loss. Furthermore, we initialise the optimisation using promising
candidates from existing dataset, effectively guiding the search away from
unfavourable regions and thus helping to avoid poor solutions. Our approach
demonstrates a more efficient exploration of superconductor candidates,
uncovering candidate materials with higher critical temperature than
conventional element-substitution and generative models. Importantly, it could
propose new compositions beyond those found in existing databases, including
new hydride superconductors absent from the training dataset but which share
compositional similarities with materials found in literature. This synergy of
domain knowledge and machine-learning-based scalability provides a robust
foundation for rapid, adaptive, and comprehensive materials design for
superconductors and beyond.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The design and discovery of new materials is fundamental to advancing
scientific and technological innovation. The recent emergence of the materials
genome concept holds great promise in revolutionising materials science by
enabling the systematic utilisation of data for efficient prediction and
optimisation of superior materials. However, the materials genome approach can
be stymied by the vast complexity of design spaces, which often demand
substantial computational resources and sophisticated data processing
capabilities. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel
generative design framework called the non-dominant sorting optimisation-based
generative adversarial networks (NSGAN). Capitalising on the synergies of
genetic algorithms (GA) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), NSGAN
provides a robust and efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional
multi-objective optimisation design problems. To validate the efficacy of the
proposed framework, we applied the model to a comprehensive dataset of
aluminium alloys. Additionally, an online tool was created as a supplementary
resource, offering a brief introduction to this innovative method for the wider
scientific community. This study explores the potential of a predictive and
data-driven approach in material design, indicating a promising pathway for
widespread applications in the field of materials science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs)
and irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role
of dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research
delineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies,
influence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision
cascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show
a marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly
modulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is
shown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect
production, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB
characteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the
investigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a
crucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB
configurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For
instance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry
can significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point
to the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced
radiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By
tailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials
can be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage,
offering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other
radiation-prone environments.</p>

Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees,
identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering

fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free
nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking
advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented

concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed
structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony,
highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In
another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite

mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We
uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a

    <p>Recent advances in deep learning generative models (GMs) have created high
capabilities in accessing and assessing complex high-dimensional data, allowing
superior efficiency in navigating vast material configuration space in search
of viable structures. Coupling such capabilities with physically significant
data to construct trained models for materials discovery is crucial to moving
this emerging field forward. Here, we present a universal GM for crystal
structure prediction (CSP) via a conditional crystal diffusion variational
autoencoder (Cond-CDVAE) approach, which is tailored to allow user-defined
material and physical parameters such as composition and pressure. This model
is trained on an expansive dataset containing over 670,000 local minimum
structures, including a rich spectrum of high-pressure structures, along with
ambient-pressure structures in Materials Project database. We demonstrate that
the Cond-CDVAE model can generate physically plausible structures with high
fidelity under diverse pressure conditions without necessitating local
optimization, accurately predicting 59.3% of the 3,547 unseen ambient-pressure
experimental structures within 800 structure samplings, with the accuracy rate
climbing to 83.2% for structures comprising fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell.
These results meet or exceed those achieved via conventional CSP methods based

    <p>The integration of deep learning, particularly AI-Generated Content, with
high-quality data derived from ab initio calculations has emerged as a

However, the challenge of designing molecular drugs or materials that
incorporate multi-modality prior knowledge remains a critical and complex

not only meeting the diversity requirements but also addressing structural and
textural constraints with various symmetries outlined by domain experts. In
this article, we present an innovative approach to tackle this inverse design
problem by formulating it as a multi-modality guidance optimization task. Our
proposed solution involves a textural-structure alignment symmetric diffusion
framework for the implementation of molecular optimization tasks, namely
3DToMolo. 3DToMolo aims to harmonize diverse modalities including textual
description features and graph structural features, aligning them seamlessly to
produce molecular structures adhere to specified symmetric structural and
textural constraints by experts in the field. Experimental trials across three
guidance optimization settings have shown a superior hit optimization
performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. Moreover, 3DToMolo
demonstrates the capability to discover potential novel molecules,
incorporating specified target substructures, without the need for prior
knowledge. This work not only holds general significance for the advancement of
deep learning methodologies but also paves the way for a transformative shift

    <p>Magnetic cooling based on the magnetocaloric effect is a promising
solid-state refrigeration technology for a wide range of applications in
different temperature ranges. Previous studies have mostly focused on near room
temperature (300 K) and cryogenic temperature (< 10 K) ranges, while important
applications such as hydrogen liquefaction call for efficient magnetic
refrigerants for the intermediate temperature 10K to 100 K. For efficient use
in this range, new magnetocaloric materials with matching Curie temperatures
need to be discovered, while conventional experimental approaches are typically
time-consuming and expensive. Here, we report a computational material
discovery pipeline based on a materials database containing more than 6000
entries auto-generated by extracting reported material properties from
literature using a large language model. We then use this database to train a
machine learning model that can efficiently predict magnetocaloric properties
of materials based on their chemical composition. We further verify the
magnetocaloric properties of predicted compounds using ab initio atomistic spin
dynamics simulations to close the loop for computational material discovery.
Using this approach, we identify 11 new promising magnetocaloric materials for
the target temperature range. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining

    <p>A high-performance p-type transparent conductor (TC) does not yet exist, but
could lead to advances in a wide range of optoelectronic applications and
enable new architectures for, e.g., next-generation photovoltaic (PV) devices.
High-throughput computational material screenings have been a promising
approach to filter databases and identify new p-type TC candidates, and some of
these predictions have been experimentally validated. However, most of these
predicted candidates do not have experimentally-achieved properties on par with
n-type TCs used in solar cells, and therefore have not yet been used in
commercial devices. Thus, there is still a significant divide between
transforming predictions into results that are actually achievable in the lab,
and an even greater lag in scaling predicted materials into functional devices.
In this perspective, we outline some of the major disconnects in this materials
discovery process -- from scaling computational predictions into synthesizable
crystals and thin films in the laboratory, to scaling lab-grown films into
real-world solar devices -- and share insights to inform future strategies for
TC discovery and design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Many of the most exciting materials discoveries in fundamental condensed
matter physics are made in systems hosting some degree of intrinsic disorder.
While disorder has historically been regarded as something to be avoided in
materials design, it is often of central importance to correlated and quantum
materials. This is largely driven by the conceptual and theoretical ease to
handle, predict, and understand highly uniform systems that exhibit complex
interactions, symmetries and band structures. In this perspective, we highlight
how flipping this paradigm has enabled exciting possibilities in the emerging
field of high entropy oxide (HEO) quantum materials. These materials host high
levels of cation or anion compositional disorder while maintaining unexpectedly
uniform single crystal lattices. The diversity of atomic scale interactions of
spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom are found to emerge into
coherent properties on much larger length scales. Thus, altering the variance
and magnitudes of the atomic scale properties through elemental selection can
open new routes to tune global correlated phases such as magnetism,
metal-insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and even emergent topological
responses. The strategy of embracing disorder in this way provides a much
broader pallet from which functional states can be designed for next-generation
microelectronic and quantum information systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) enables direct
observation of nanoscale chemical processes crucial for catalysis and materials
design. However, the high-energy electron probe can dramatically alter reaction
pathways through radiolysis - the dissociation of molecules under electron beam
irradiation. While extensively studied in liquid-cell TEM, the impact of
radiolysis in gas-phase reactions remains unexplored. Here, we present a
numerical model elucidating radiation chemistry in both gas and liquid E-TEM
environments. Our findings reveal that while gas-phase E-TEM generates
radiolytic species with lower reactivity than liquid-phase systems, these
species can accumulate to reaction-altering concentrations, particularly at
elevated pressures. We validate our model through two case studies: the
radiation-promoted oxidation of aluminum nanocubes and disproportionation of
carbon monoxide. In both cases, increasing the electron beam dose rate directly
accelerates their reaction kinetics, as demonstrated by enhanced AlOx growth
and carbon deposition. Based on these insights, we establish practical
guidelines for controlling radiolysis in closed-cell nanoreactors. This work
not only resolves a fundamental challenge in electron microscopy but also
advances our ability to rationally design materials with sub-Angstrom
resolution.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The metallurgy and materials communities have long known and exploited
fundamental links between chemical and structural ordering in metallic solids
and their mechanical properties. The highest reported strength achievable
through the combination of multiple metals (alloying) has rapidly climbed and
given rise to new classifications of materials with extraordinary properties.
Metallic glasses and high-entropy alloys are two limiting examples of how
tailored order can be used to manipulate mechanical behavior. Here, we show
that the complex electronic-structure mechanisms governing the peak strength of
alloys and pure metals can be reduced to a few physically-meaningful parameters
based on their atomic arrangements and used (with no fitting parameters) to
predict the maximum strength of any metallic solid, regardless of degree of
structural or chemical ordering. Predictions of maximum strength based on the
activation energy for a stress-driven phase transition to an amorphous state is
shown to accurately describe the breakdown in Hall-Petch behavior at the
smallest crystallite sizes for pure metals, intermetallic compounds, metallic
glasses, and high-entropy alloys. This activation energy is also shown to be
directly proportional to interstitial (electronic) charge density, which is a
good predictor of ductility, stiffness (moduli), and phase stability in
high-entropy alloys, and in solid metals generally. The proposed framework
suggests the possibility of coupling ordering and intrinsic strength to
mechanisms like dislocation nucleation, hydrogen embrittlement, and transport
properties. It additionally opens the prospect for greatly accelerated
structural materials design and development to address materials challenges
limiting more sustainable and efficient use of energy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Both computational and experimental material discovery bring forth the
challenge of exploring multidimensional and often non-differentiable parameter
spaces, such as phase diagrams of Hamiltonians with multiple interactions,
composition spaces of combinatorial libraries, processing spaces, and molecular
embedding spaces. Often these systems are expensive or time-consuming to
evaluate a single instance, and hence classical approaches based on exhaustive
grid or random search are too data intensive. This resulted in strong interest
towards active learning methods such as Bayesian optimization (BO) where the
adaptive exploration occurs based on human learning (discovery) objective.
However, classical BO is based on a predefined optimization target, and
policies balancing exploration and exploitation are purely data driven. In
practical settings, the domain expert can pose prior knowledge on the system in
form of partially known physics laws and often varies exploration policies
during the experiment. Here, we explore interactive workflows building on
multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), starting with classical (data-driven) MFBO, then
structured (physics-driven) sMFBO, and extending it to allow human in the loop
interactive iMFBO workflows for adaptive and domain expert aligned exploration.
These approaches are demonstrated over highly non-smooth multi-fidelity
simulation data generated from an Ising model, considering spin-spin
interaction as parameter space, lattice sizes as fidelity spaces, and the
objective as maximizing heat capacity. Detailed analysis and comparison show
the impact of physics knowledge injection and on-the-fly human decisions for
improved exploration, current challenges, and potential opportunities for
algorithm development with combining data, physics and real time human
decisions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Tailoring materials to achieve a desired behavior in specific applications is
of significant scientific and industrial interest as design of materials is a
key driver to innovation. Overcoming the rather slow and expertise-bound
traditional forward approaches of trial and error, inverse design is attracting
substantial attention. Targeting a property, the design model proposes a
candidate structure with the desired property. This concept can be particularly
well applied to the field of architected materials as their structures can be
directly tuned. The bone-like spinodoid materials are a specific class of
architected materials. They are of considerable interest thanks to their
non-periodicity, smoothness, and low-dimensional statistical description.
Previous work successfully employed machine learning (ML) models for inverse
design. The amount of data necessary for most ML approaches poses a severe
obstacle for broader application, especially in the context of inelasticity.
That is why we propose an inverse-design approach based on Bayesian
optimization to operate in the small-data regime. Necessitating substantially
less data, a small initial data set is iteratively augmented by in silico
generated data until a structure with the targeted properties is found. The
application to the inverse design of spinodoid structures of desired elastic
properties demonstrates the framework's potential for paving the way for
advance in inverse design.</p>

    <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous prospects in all
aspects of technology, including design. However, due to its heavy demand on
resources, it is usually trained on large computing infrastructure and often
made available as a cloud-based service. In this position paper, we consider
the potential, challenges, and promising approaches for generative AI for
design on the edge, i.e., in resource-constrained settings where memory,
compute, energy (battery) and network connectivity may be limited. Adapting
generative AI for such settings involves overcoming significant hurdles,
primarily in how to streamline complex models to function efficiently in
low-resource environments. This necessitates innovative approaches in model
compression, efficient algorithmic design, and perhaps even leveraging edge
computing. The objective is to harness the power of generative AI in creating
bespoke solutions for design problems, such as medical interventions, farm
equipment maintenance, and educational material design, tailored to the unique
constraints and needs of remote areas. These efforts could democratize access

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) promotes the polymer design paradigm from a
traditional trial-and-error approach to a data-driven style. Achieving high
thermal conductivity (TC) for intrinsic polymers is urgent because of their
importance in the thermal management of many industrial applications such as
microelectronic devices and integrated circuits. In this work, we have proposed
a robust AI-assisted workflow for the inverse design of high TC polymers. By
using 1144 polymers with known computational TCs, we construct a surrogate deep
neural network model for TC prediction and extract a polymer-unit library with
32 sequences. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms of
unified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (U-NSGA-III) and q-noisy
expected hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI) are employed for sequence-ordered
polymer design with both high TC and synthetic possibility. For triblock
polymer design, the result indicates that qNHEVI is capable of exploring a
diversity of optimal polymers at the Pareto front, but the uncertainty in
Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling makes the trials costly. The performance of
U-NSGA-III is affected by the initial random structures and usually falls into
a locally optimal solution, but it takes fewer attempts with lower costs. 20
parallel U-NSGA-III runs are conducted to design the pentablock polymers with
high TC, and half of the candidates among 1921 generated polymers achieve the
targets (TC > 0.4 W/(mK) and SA < 3.0). Ultimately, we check the TC of 50
promising polymers through molecular dynamics simulations and reveal the
intrinsic connections between microstructures and TCs. Our developed
AI-assisted inverse design approach for polymers is flexible and universal, and
can be extended to the design of polymers with other target properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In Materials Science, material development involves evaluating and optimizing
the internal structures of the material, generically referred to as
microstructures. Microstructures structure is stochastic, analogously to image
textures. A particular microstructure can be well characterized by its spatial
statistics, analogously to image texture being characterized by the response to
a Fourier-like filter bank. Material design would benefit from low-dimensional
representation of microstructures Paulson et al. (2017).
  In this work, we train a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to produce
reconstructions of textures that preserve the spatial statistics of the
original texture, while not necessarily reconstructing the same image in data
space. We accomplish this by adding a differentiable term to the cost function
in order to minimize the distance between the original and the reconstruction
in spatial statistics space.
  Our experiments indicate that it is possible to train a VAE that minimizes
the distance in spatial statistics space between the original and the
reconstruction of synthetic images. In future work, we will apply the same
techniques to microstructures, with the goal of obtaining low-dimensional
representations of material microstructures.</p>

    <p>While density functional theory (DFT) serves as a prevalent computational

for accelerating electronic structure computations. Despite advancements,

for multi-elemental materials still exist. Addressing these hurdles, this study
introduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian

structures on the Materials Project. We demonstrate its generality in
predicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including
complex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\'e twisted
bilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we
utilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of
electronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940
crystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering
a reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this

    <p>Lattices are architected metamaterials whose properties strongly depend on
their geometrical design. The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the
use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to
traditional methods such as finite element modelling. In this work, we generate
a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices. The
dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development of
methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order
tensors. In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this
dataset. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii)
consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare
the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and
demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced

    <p>Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for
advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional
molecular generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score
and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains
unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for
multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT integrates an encoder to
learn numerical and categorical property representations with the
Transformer-based denoiser. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add
noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, Graph
DiT is trained with a novel graph-dependent noise model for accurate estimation
of graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate Graph DiT for
multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate
the superiority of Graph DiT across nine metrics from distribution learning to
condition control for molecular properties. A polymer inverse design task for
gas separation with feedback from domain experts further demonstrates its
practical utility.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Mechanical metamaterial is a synthetic material that can possess
extraordinary physical characteristics, such as abnormal elasticity, stiffness,
and stability, by carefully designing its internal structure. To make
metamaterials contain delicate local structures with unique mechanical
properties, it is a potential method to represent them through high-resolution
voxels. However, it brings a substantial computational burden. To this end,
this paper proposes a fast inverse design method, whose core is an advanced
deep generative AI algorithm, to generate voxel-based mechanical metamaterials.
Specifically, we use the self-conditioned diffusion model, capable of
generating a microstructure with a resolution of $128^3$ to approach the
specified homogenized tensor matrix in just 3 seconds. Accordingly, this rapid
reverse design tool facilitates the exploration of extreme metamaterials, the
sequence interpolation in metamaterials, and the generation of diverse
microstructures for multi-scale design. This flexible and adaptive generative
tool is of great value in structural engineering or other mechanical systems
and can stimulate more subsequent research.</p>

    <p>Efficiently generating energetically stable crystal structures has long been
a challenge in material design, primarily due to the immense arrangement of
atoms in a crystal lattice. To facilitate the discovery of stable material, we
present a framework for the generation of synthesizable materials, leveraging a
point cloud representation to encode intricate structural information. At the
heart of this framework lies the introduction of a diffusion model as its
foundational pillar. To gauge the efficacy of our approach, we employ it to
reconstruct input structures from our training datasets, rigorously validating
its high reconstruction performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the profound
potential of Point Cloud-Based Crystal Diffusion (PCCD) by generating entirely
new materials, emphasizing their synthesizability. Our research stands as a
noteworthy contribution to the advancement of materials design and synthesis
through the cutting-edge avenue of generative design instead of the
conventional substitution or experience-based discovery.</p>

    <p>Inverse design, where we seek to design input variables in order to optimize
an underlying objective function, is an important problem that arises across
fields such as mechanical engineering to aerospace engineering. Inverse design
is typically formulated as an optimization problem, with recent works
leveraging optimization across learned dynamics models. However, as models are
optimized they tend to fall into adversarial modes, preventing effective
sampling. We illustrate that by instead optimizing over the learned energy
function captured by the diffusion model, we can avoid such adversarial
examples and significantly improve design performance. We further illustrate
how such a design system is compositional, enabling us to combine multiple
different diffusion models representing subcomponents of our desired system to
design systems with every specified component. In an N-body interaction task
and a challenging 2D multi-airfoil design task, we demonstrate that by
composing the learned diffusion model at test time, our method allows us to
design initial states and boundary shapes that are more complex than those in
the training data. Our method generalizes to more objects for N-body dataset
and discovers formation flying to minimize drag in the multi-airfoil design
task. Project website and code can be found at

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Microstructure is key to controlling and understanding the properties of
metallic materials, but traditional approaches to describing microstructure
capture only a small number of features. To enable data-centric approaches to
materials discovery, allow efficient storage of microstructural data and assist
in quality control in metals processing, we require more complete descriptors
of microstructure. The concept of microstructural fingerprinting, using machine
learning (ML) to develop quantitative, low-dimensional descriptors of
microstructures, has recently attracted significant attention. However, it is
difficult to interpret conclusions drawn by ML algorithms, which are commonly
referred to as "black boxes".
  Here we explore variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can be trained to
produce microstructural fingerprints in a continuous latent space. VAEs enable
the reconstruction of images from fingerprints, allowing us to explore how key
features of microstructure are encoded. We develop a VAE architecture based on
ResNet18 and train it on Ti-6Al-4V optical micrographs as an example of an
industrially important alloy where microstructural control is critical to
performance. The latent space is explored in several ways, including by
supplying interpolated and randomly perturbed fingerprints to the trained
decoder and via dimensionality reduction to explore the distribution of
microstructural features within the latent space of fingerprints. We show that
the VAE fingerprints exhibit smooth, interpolable behaviour with stability to
local perturbations, supporting their suitability as general purpose
descriptors for microstructure. We also show that key properties of the
microstructures are strongly correlated with position in the latent space,
supporting the use of VAE fingerprints for quantitative exploration of
process-structure-property relationships.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Most approaches for designing self-assembled materials focus on the
thermodynamic stability of a target structure or crystal polymorph. Yet in
practice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic
pathways. Here we present an efficient machine learning-guided design algorithm
to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the
thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show
that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility
of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the
extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly
conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition
among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which
favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing
polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for
multi-objective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs
between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing
polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms
that optimize for kinetic accessibility.</p>

    <p>Materials with high-dielectric constant easily polarize under external
electric fields, allowing them to perform essential functions in many modern
electronic devices. Their practical utility is determined by two conflicting
properties: high dielectric constants tend to occur in materials with narrow
band gaps, limiting the operating voltage before dielectric breakdown. We
present a high-throughput workflow that combines element substitution, ML
pre-screening, ab initio simulation and human expert intuition to efficiently
explore the vast space of unknown materials for potential dielectrics, leading
to the synthesis and characterization of two novel dielectric materials,
CsTaTeO6 and Bi2Zr2O7. Our key idea is to deploy ML in a multi-objective
optimization setting with concave Pareto front. While usually considered more
challenging than single-objective optimization, we argue and show preliminary
evidence that the $1/x$-correlation between band gap and permittivity in fact
makes the task more amenable to ML methods by allowing separate models for band
gap and permittivity to each operate in regions of good training support while
still predicting materials of exceptional merit. To our knowledge, this is the
first instance of successful ML-guided multi-objective materials optimization
achieving experimental synthesis and characterization. CsTaTeO6 is a structure
generated via element substitution not present in our reference data sources,
thus exemplifying successful de-novo materials design. Meanwhile, we report the
first high-purity synthesis and dielectric characterization of Bi2Zr2O7 with a
band gap of 2.27 eV and a permittivity of 20.5, meeting all target metrics of
our multi-objective search.</p>

    <p>Developing novel lead-free ferroelectric materials is crucial for
next-generation microelectronic technologies that are energy efficient and

are typically time-consuming due to the limited throughput of traditional
synthesis methods. In this work, we use a high-throughput combinatorial
synthesis approach to fabricate lead-free ferroelectric superlattices and solid
solutions of (Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BCT) and Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (BZT) phases with
continuous variation of composition and layer thickness. High-resolution X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) demonstrate high film quality and well-controlled compositional
gradients. Ferroelectric and dielectric property measurements identify the
optimal property point achieved at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) with a
composition of 48BZT-52BCT. Displacement vector maps reveal that ferroelectric
domain sizes are tunable by varying {BCT-BZT}N superlattice geometry. This
high-throughput synthesis approach can be applied to many other material
systems to expedite new materials discovery and properties optimization,
allowing for the exploration of a large area of phase space within a single

    <p>Exploring the vast composition space of multi-component alloys presents a

ultimately impedes the discovery of novel, stable materials that may display

(CDVAE) model is adapted to characterize the stable compositions of a well
studied multi-component alloy, NiFeCr, with two distinct crystalline phases
known to be stable across its compositional space. To this end, novel
extensions to CDVAE were proposed, enhancing the model's ability to reconstruct
configurations from their latent space within the test set by approximately
30\% . A fact that increases a model's probability of discovering new materials
when dealing with various crystalline structures. Afterwards, the new model is
applied for materials generation, demonstrating excellent agreement in
identifying stable configurations within the ternary phase space when compared
to first principles data. Finally, a computationally efficient framework for
inverse design is proposed, employing Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of
multi-component alloys with reliable interatomic potentials, enabling the

    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in accelerated materials
innovation in the context of the process-structure-property chain. In this
regard, it is essential to take into account manufacturing processes and tailor
materials design approaches to support downstream process design approaches. As
a major step into this direction, we present a holistic and generic
optimization approach that covers the entire process-structure-property chain
in materials engineering. Our approach specifically employs machine learning to
address two critical identification problems: a materials design problem, which
involves identifying near-optimal material microstructures that exhibit desired
properties, and a process design problem that is to find an optimal processing
path to manufacture these microstructures. Both identification problems are
typically ill-posed, which presents a significant challenge for solution
approaches. However, the non-unique nature of these problems offers an
important advantage for processing: By having several target microstructures
that perform similarly well, processes can be efficiently guided towards
manufacturing the best reachable microstructure. The functionality of the
approach is demonstrated at manufacturing crystallographic textures with
desired properties in a simulated metal forming process.</p>

    <p>Learning representations of molecular structures using deep learning is a
fundamental problem in molecular property prediction tasks. Molecules
inherently exist in the real world as three-dimensional structures;
furthermore, they are not static but in continuous motion in the 3D Euclidean
space, forming a potential energy surface. Therefore, it is desirable to
generate multiple conformations in advance and extract molecular
representations using a 4D-QSAR model that incorporates multiple conformations.
However, this approach is impractical for drug and material discovery tasks
because of the computational cost of obtaining multiple conformations. To
address this issue, we propose a pre-training method for molecular GNNs using
an existing dataset of molecular conformations to generate a latent vector
universal to multiple conformations from a 2D molecular graph. Our method,
called Boltzmann GNN, is formulated by maximizing the conditional marginal
likelihood of a conditional generative model for conformations generation. We
show that our model has a better prediction performance for molecular
properties than existing pre-training methods using molecular graphs and
three-dimensional molecular structures.</p>

    <p>Chiral exact flat bands (FBs) at charge neutrality have attracted much recent

many-body phenomena, as specifically shown in "magic angle" twisted bilayer
graphene for superconductivity and triangulene-based superatomic graphene for
excitonic condensation. Yet, no generic physical model to realize such FBs has
been developed. Here we present a new mathematical theorem, called bipartite
double cover (BDC) theorem, and prove that the BDC of line-graph (LG) lattices
hosts at least two chiral exact FBs of opposite chirality, i.e., yin-yang FBs,
centered-around/at charge neutrality (E = 0) akin to the "chiral limit" of
twisted bilayer graphene. We illustrate this theorem by mapping it exactly onto
tight-binding lattice models of the BDC of LGs of hexagonal lattice for strong
topological and of triangular lattice for fragile topological FBs,
respectively. Moreover, we use orbital design principle to realize such exotic
yin-yang FBs in non-BDC lattices to instigate their real material discovery.
This work not only enables the search for exact chiral FBs at zero energy
beyond moir\'e heterostructures, but also opens the door to discovering quantum

that broadly describes the physicochemical, stability/geometrical, and Density

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Traditional design cycles for new materials and assemblies have two
fundamental drawbacks. The underlying physical relationships are often too
complex to be precisely calculated and described. Aside from that, many unknown
uncertainties, such as exact manufacturing parameters or materials composition,
dominate the real assembly behavior. Machine learning (ML) methods overcome
these fundamental limitations through data-driven learning. In addition, modern
approaches can specifically increase system knowledge. Representation Learning
allows the physical, and if necessary, even symbolic interpretation of the
learned solution. In this way, the most complex physical relationships can be
considered and quickly described. Furthermore, generative ML approaches can
synthesize possible morphologies of the materials based on defined conditions
to visualize the effects of uncertainties. This modern approach accelerates the
design process for new materials and enables the prediction and interpretation
of realistic materials behavior.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal structure design is important for the discovery of new highly
functional materials because crystal structure strongly influences material
properties. Crystal structures are composed of space-filling polyhedra, which
affect material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant.
However, most conventional methods of crystal structure prediction use random
structure generation methods that do not take space-filling polyhedra into
account, contributing to the inefficiency of materials development. In this
work, we propose a crystal structure generation method based on discrete
geometric analysis of polyhedra information. In our method, the shape and
connectivity of a space-filling polyhedron are represented as a dual periodic
graph, and the crystal structure is generated by the standard realization of
this graph. We demonstrate that this method can correctly generate
face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic structures
from dual periodic graphs. This work is a first step toward generating
undiscovered crystal structures based on the target polyhedra, leading to major
advances in materials design in areas including electronics and energy storage.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) has significantly
enhanced the systemic analysis of the relationship between microstructure and
material properties, paving the way for the development of high-performance
materials. However, analyzing microstructure-sensitive material behavior
remains challenging due to the scarcity of three-dimensional (3D)
microstructure datasets. Moreover, this challenge is amplified if the
microstructure is anisotropic, as this results in anisotropic material
properties as well. In this paper, we present a framework for reconstruction of
anisotropic microstructures solely based on two-dimensional (2D) micrographs
using conditional diffusion-based generative models (DGMs). The proposed
framework involves spatial connection of multiple 2D conditional DGMs, each
trained to generate 2D microstructure samples for three different orthogonal
planes. The connected multiple reverse diffusion processes then enable
effective modeling of a Markov chain for transforming noise into a 3D
microstructure sample. Furthermore, a modified harmonized sampling is employed
to enhance the sample quality while preserving the spatial connection between
the slices of anisotropic microstructure samples in 3D space. To validate the
proposed framework, the 2D-to-3D reconstructed anisotropic microstructure
samples are evaluated in terms of both the spatial correlation function and the
physical material behavior. The results demonstrate that the framework is
capable of reproducing not only the statistical distribution of material phases
but also the material properties in 3D space. This highlights the potential
application of the proposed 2D-to-3D reconstruction framework in establishing
microstructure-property linkages, which could aid high-throughput material
design for future studies</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The ability to rapidly develop materials with desired properties has a
transformative impact on a broad range of emerging technologies. In this work,
we introduce a new framework based on the diffusion model, a recent generative
machine learning method to predict 3D structures of disordered materials from a
target property. For demonstration, we apply the model to identify the atomic
structures of amorphous carbons ($a$-C) as a representative material system
from the target X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra--a common
experimental technique to probe atomic structures of materials. We show that
conditional generation guided by XANES spectra reproduces key features of the
target structures. Furthermore, we show that our model can steer the generative
process to tailor atomic arrangements for a specific XANES spectrum. Finally,
our generative model exhibits a remarkable scale-agnostic property, thereby
enabling generation of realistic, large-scale structures through learning from
a small-scale dataset (i.e., with small unit cells). Our work represents a
significant stride in bridging the gap between materials characterization and
atomic structure determination; in addition, it can be leveraged for materials
discovery in exploring various material properties as targeted.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In-situ Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is an instrumental technique
that has traditionally been used to understand how the choice of materials
processing has the ability to change local structure and composition. However,
more recent advances to observe and react to transient changes occurring at the
ultrafast timescales that are now possible with EELS and Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) will require new frameworks for characterization and analysis.
We describe a machine learning (ML) framework for the rapid assessment and
characterization of in operando EELS Spectrum Images (EELS-SI) without the need
for many labeled training datapoints as typically required for deep learning
classification methods. By embedding computationally generated structures and
experimental datasets into an equivalent latent space through Variational
Autoencoders (VAE), we effectively predict the structural changes at latency
scales relevant to closed-loop processing within the TEM. The framework
described in this study is a critical step in enabling automated, on-the-fly
synthesis and characterization which will greatly advance capabilities for
materials discovery and precision engineering of functional materials at the
atomic scale.</p>

    <p>Torquato and Kim [Phys. Rev. X 11, 296 021002 (2021)] derived exact nonlocal
strong-contrast expansions of the effective dynamic dielectric constant tensor
that treat general three-dimensional (3D) two-phase composites, which are valid
well beyond the long-wavelength regime. Here, we demonstrate that truncating
this general rapidly converging series at the two- and three-point levels is a
powerful theoretical tool for extracting accurate approximations suited for
various microstructural symmetries. We derive such closed-form formulas
applicable to transverse polarization in layered media and transverse magnetic
polarization in transversely isotropic media, respectively. We use these
formulas to estimate effective dielectric constant for models of 3D disordered
hyperuniform layered and transversely isotropic media: nonstealthy hyperuniform
and stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) media. In particular, we show that SHU media
are perfectly transparent (trivially implying no Anderson localization, in
principle) within finite wave number intervals through the third-order terms.
For these two models, we validate that the second-order formulas, which depend
on the spectral density, are already very accurate well beyond the
long-wavelength regime by showing very good agreement with the
finite-difference time-domain simulations. The high predictive power of the
second-order formulas implies that higher-order contributions are negligibly
small, and thus, it very accurately approximates multiple scattering effects.
Therefore, there can be no Anderson localization in practice within the
predicted perfect transparency interval in SHU media because the localization
length should be very large compared to any practically large sample size. Our
predictive theory provides a foundation for the inverse design of novel
effective wave characteristics of disordered and statistically anisotropic
structures.</p>

    <p>Metamaterials with functional responses can exhibit varying properties under
different conditions (e.g., wave-based responses or deformation-induced
property variation). This work addresses the rapid inverse design of such
metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due
to its intractability and non-unique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and
non-interpretable deep-learning-based methods, we propose the
Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), a
single-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterial designs
with on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a
random forest-based "design$\rightarrow$response" forward model, eliminating
the need for a more complex "response$\rightarrow$design" inverse model. Based
on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random
forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods. We validate RIGID on acoustic and optical metamaterial
design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the
genetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates
satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing
for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target
satisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse
design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable
machine learning into generative design under small data constraints.</p>

    <p>The crystallographic texture of metallic materials is a key microstructural
feature that is responsible for the anisotropic behavior, e.g., important in
forming operations. In materials science, crystallographic texture is commonly
described by the orientation distribution function, which is defined as the
probability density function of the orientations of the monocrystal grains
conforming a polycrystalline material. For representing the orientation
distribution function, there are several approaches such as using generalized
spherical harmonics, orientation histograms, and pole figure images . Measuring
distances between crystallographic textures is essential for any task that
requires assessing texture similarities, e.g. to guide forming processes.
Therefore, we introduce novel distance measures based on (i) the Earth Movers
Distance that takes into account local distance information encoded in
histogram-based texture representations and (ii) a distance measure based on
pole figure images. For this purpose, we evaluate and compare existing distance
measures for selected use-cases. The present study gives insights into
advantages and drawbacks of using certain texture representations and distance
measures with emphasis on applications in materials design and optimal process
control.</p>

    <p>Vitrimer is a new, exciting class of sustainable polymers with the ability to
heal due to their dynamic covalent adaptive network that can go through
associative rearrangement reactions. However, a limited choice of constituent
molecules restricts their property space, prohibiting full realization of their
potential applications. To overcome this challenge, we couple molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE)
machine learning model for inverse design of vitrimer chemistries with desired
glass transition temperature (Tg) and synthesize a novel vitrimer polymer. We
build the first vitrimer dataset of one million chemistries and calculate Tg on
8,424 of them by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian
process model. The proposed novel VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent
dimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of
multi-component vitrimers. By constructing a continuous latent space containing
necessary information of vitrimers, we demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency
of our framework in discovering novel vitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the
training regime. To validate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments,
we generate novel vitrimer chemistries with a target Tg = 323 K. By
incorporating chemical intuition, we synthesize a vitrimer with Tg of 311-317
K, and experimentally demonstrate healability and flowability. The proposed

    <p>The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in
driving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and
carbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design
by directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property
constraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low
success rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited
set of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates
stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further
be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property
constraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative
process that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,
coordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to
enable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled
dataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen
are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times
closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully
generates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as
mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate
multi-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have
both high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain
risk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of
MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a
universal generative model for materials design.</p>

    <p>Generative design marks a significant data-driven advancement in the
exploration of novel inorganic materials, which entails learning the symmetry
equivalent to the crystal structure prediction (CSP) task and subsequent
learning of their target properties. Generative models have been developed in
the last few years that use custom Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion models. While periodicity and global
Euclidian symmetry in three dimensions through translations, rotations and
reflections have recently been accounted for, symmetry constraints within
allowed space groups have not. This is especially important because the final
step involves energy relaxation on the generated crystal structures to find the
relaxed crystal structure, typically using Density Functional Theory (DFT). To
address this explicitly, we introduce a generative design framework (WyCryst),
composed of three pivotal components: 1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic
crystal representation, 2) a property-directed VAE model and 3) an automated
DFT workflow for structure refinement. Our model selectively generates
materials that follow the ground truth of unit cell space group symmetry by
encoding the Wyckoff representation for each space group. We successfully
reproduce a variety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and
221), CsPbI3 (SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both
ground state as well as polymorphic structure predictions. We also generate
several new ternary materials not found in the inorganic materials database
(Materials Project), which are proved to be stable, retaining their symmetry,
and we also check their phonon stability, using our automated DFT workflow
highlighting the validity of our approach. We believe our symmetry-aware
WyCryst takes a vital step towards AI-driven inorganic materials discovery.</p>

    <p>Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of
architected materials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable
through lab-based trial-and-error methods. However, a major challenge in
current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational
and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for
designing micro-scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear
mechanical behaviors. Here, we introduce a new end-to-end scientific ML
framework, leveraging deep neural operators (DeepONet), to directly learn the
relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of
architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental
data. The approach facilitates the inverse design of structures tailored to
specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from spinodal
microstructures, printed using two-photon lithography, reveal that the
prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 - 10%. Our
work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced
micro-mechanics experimental techniques, the design of complex
micro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity. Our work marks a significant
advancement in the field of materials-by-design, potentially heralding a new

    <p>Machine learning is transforming materials discovery by providing rapid

data extraction from scientific literature has potential, current
auto-generated datasets often lack sufficient accuracy and critical structural

extraction yields an order of magnitude lower error rate. Combined with
additional prompts to select a subset of experimentally measured properties
from pure, single-crystalline bulk materials, this results in an automatically
extracted dataset that's larger and more diverse than the largest existing
human-curated database of experimental band gaps. Compared to the existing
human-curated database, we show the model trained on our extracted database

Finally, we demonstrate that LLMs are able to train models predicting band gap

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A significant development towards inverse design of materials with
well-defined target properties is reported. A deep generative model based on
variational autoencoder (VAE), conditioned simultaneously by two target
properties, is developed to inverse design stable magnetic materials. Structure
of the physics informed, property embedded latent space of the model is
analyzed using graph theory, based on the idea of similarity index. The graph
idea is shown to be useful for generating new materials that are likely to
satisfy target properties. An impressive ~96% of the generated materials is
found to satisfy the target properties as per predictions from the target
learning branches. This is a huge improvement over approaches that do not
condition the VAE latent space by target properties, or do not consider
connectivity of the parent materials perturbing which the new materials are
generated. In such models, the fraction of materials satisfying targets can be
as low as ~5%. This impressive feat is achieved using a simple real-space only
representation called Invertible Real-space Crystallographic Representation
(IRCR), that can be directly read from material cif files. Model predictions
are finally validated by performing DFT calculations on a randomly chosen
subset of materials. Performance of the present model using IRCR is comparable
or superior to that of the models reported earlier. This model for magnetic
material generation, MagGen, is applied to the problem of designing rare earth
free permanent magnets with promising results.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In materials science, the challenge of rapid prototyping materials with
desired properties often involves extensive experimentation to find suitable
microstructures. Additionally, finding microstructures for given properties is
typically an ill-posed problem where multiple solutions may exist. Using
generative machine learning models can be a viable solution which also reduces
the computational cost. This comes with new challenges because, e.g., a
continuous property variable as conditioning input to the model is required. We
investigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel
embedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary
representation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for
normalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space
for conditioning the generative model. This technique can be applied to
condition a network on any number, to provide fine control over generated
microstructure images, thereby contributing to accelerated materials design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Many environmental remediation and energy applications (conversion and
storage) for sustainability need design and development of green novel
materials. Discovery processes of such novel materials are time taking and
cumbersome due to large number of possible combinations and permutations of
materials structures. Often theoretical studies based on Density Functional
Theory (DFT) and other theories, coupled with Simulations are conducted to
narrow down sample space of candidate materials, before conducting
laboratory-based synthesis and analytical process. With the emergence of
artificial intelligence (AI), AI techniques are being tried in this process too
to ease out simulation time and cost. However tremendous values of previously
published research from various parts of the world are still left as
labor-intensive manual effort and discretion of individual researcher and prone
to human omissions. AIMS-EREA is our novel framework to blend best of breed of
Material Science theory with power of Generative AI to give best impact and
smooth and quickest discovery of material for sustainability. This also helps
to eliminate the possibility of production of hazardous residues and
bye-products of the reactions. AIMS-EREA uses all available resources --
Predictive and Analytical AI on large collection of chemical databases along
with automated intelligent assimilation of deep materials knowledge from
previously published research works through Generative AI. We demonstrate use
of our own novel framework with an example, how this framework can be
successfully applied to achieve desired success in development of
thermoelectric material for waste heat conversion.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Although the convergence of high-performance computing, automation, and
machine learning has significantly altered the materials design timeline,
transformative advances in functional materials and acceleration of their
design will require addressing the deficiencies that currently exist in
materials informatics, particularly a lack of standardized experimental data
management. The challenges associated with experimental data management are
especially true for combinatorial materials science, where advancements in
automation of experimental workflows have produced datasets that are often too
large and too complex for human reasoning. The data management challenge is
further compounded by the multi-modal and multi-institutional nature of these
datasets, as they tend to be distributed across multiple institutions and can
vary substantially in format, size, and content. To adequately map a materials
design space from such datasets, an ideal materials data infrastructure would
contain data and metadata describing i) synthesis and processing conditions,
ii) characterization results, and iii) property and performance measurements.
Here, we present a case study for the low-barrier development of such a
dashboard that enables standardized organization, analysis, and visualization
of a large data lake consisting of combinatorial datasets of synthesis and
processing conditions, X-ray diffraction patterns, and materials property
measurements generated at several different institutions. While this dashboard
was developed specifically for data-driven thermoelectric materials discovery,
we envision the adaptation of this prototype to other materials applications,
and, more ambitiously, future integration into an all-encompassing materials

    <p>It stands to reason that the amount and the quality of data is of key
importance for setting up accurate AI-driven models. Among others, a
fundamental aspect to consider is the bias introduced during sample selection
in database generation. This is particularly relevant when a model is trained
on a specialized dataset to predict a property of interest, and then applied to
forecast the same property over samples having a completely different genesis.
Indeed, the resulting biased model will likely produce unreliable predictions
for many of those out-of-the-box samples. Neglecting such an aspect may hinder
the AI-based discovery process, even when high quality, sufficiently large and
highly reputable data sources are available. In this regard, with
superconducting and thermoelectric materials as two prototypical case studies
in the field of energy material discovery, we present and validate a new method
(based on a classification strategy) capable of detecting, quantifying and
circumventing the presence of cross-domain data bias.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) techniques and atomistic modeling have rapidly
transformed materials design and discovery. Specifically, generative models can
swiftly propose promising materials for targeted applications. However, the
predicted properties of materials through the generative models often do not
match with calculated properties through ab initio calculations. This
discrepancy can arise because the generated coordinates are not fully relaxed,
whereas the many properties are derived from relaxed structures. Neural
network-based potentials (NNPs) can expedite the process by providing relaxed
structures from the initially generated ones. Nevertheless, acquiring data to
train NNPs for this purpose can be extremely challenging as it needs to
encompass previously unknown structures. This study utilized extended ensemble
molecular dynamics (MD) to secure a broad range of liquid- and solid-phase
configurations in one of the metallic systems, nickel. Then, we could
significantly reduce them through active learning without losing much accuracy.
We found that the NNP trained from the distilled data could predict different
energy-minimized closed-pack crystal structures even though those structures
were not explicitly part of the initial data. Furthermore, the data can be
translated to other metallic systems (aluminum and niobium), without repeating
the sampling and distillation processes. Our approach to data acquisition and
distillation has demonstrated the potential to expedite NNP development and
enhance materials design and discovery by integrating generative models.</p>

    <p>Machine learning and especially deep learning has had an increasing impact on
molecule and materials design. In particular, given the growing access to an
abundance of high-quality small molecule data for generative modeling for drug
design, results for drug discovery have been promising. However, for many
important classes of materials such as catalysts, antioxidants, and
metal-organic frameworks, such large datasets are not available. Such families
of molecules with limited samples and structural similarities are especially
prevalent for industrial applications. As is well-known, retraining and even
fine-tuning are challenging on such small datasets. Novel, practically
applicable molecules are most often derivatives of well-known molecules,
suggesting approaches to addressing data scarcity. To address this problem, we
introduce $\textbf{STRIDE}$, a generative molecule workflow that generates
novel molecules with an unconditional generative model guided by known
molecules without any retraining. We generate molecules outside of the training
data from a highly specialized set of antioxidant molecules. Our generated
molecules have on average 21.7% lower synthetic accessibility scores and also
reduce ionization potential by 5.9% of generated molecules via guiding.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Molecular conformation optimization is crucial to computer-aided drug
discovery and materials design. Traditional energy minimization techniques rely
on iterative optimization methods that use molecular forces calculated by a
physical simulator (oracle) as anti-gradients. However, this is a
computationally expensive approach that requires many interactions with a
physical simulator. One way to accelerate this procedure is to replace the
physical simulator with a neural network. Despite recent progress in neural
networks for molecular conformation energy prediction, such models are prone to
distribution shift, leading to inaccurate energy minimization. We find that the
quality of energy minimization with neural networks can be improved by
providing optimization trajectories as additional training data. Still, it
takes around $5 \times 10^5$ additional conformations to match the physical
simulator's optimization quality. In this work, we present the Gradual
Optimization Learning Framework (GOLF) for energy minimization with neural
networks that significantly reduces the required additional data. The framework
consists of an efficient data-collecting scheme and an external optimizer. The
external optimizer utilizes gradients from the energy prediction model to
generate optimization trajectories, and the data-collecting scheme selects
additional training data to be processed by the physical simulator. Our results
demonstrate that the neural network trained with GOLF performs on par with the
oracle on a benchmark of diverse drug-like molecules using $50$x less
additional data.</p>

    <p>Transformer neural networks show promising capabilities, in particular for
uses in materials analysis, design and manufacturing, including their capacity
to work effectively with both human language, symbols, code, and numerical
data. Here we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as a tool that
can support engineering analysis of materials, applied to retrieving key
information about subject areas, developing research hypotheses, discovery of
mechanistic relationships across disparate areas of knowledge, and writing and
executing simulation codes for active knowledge generation based on physical
ground truths. When used as sets of AI agents with specific features,
capabilities, and instructions, LLMs can provide powerful problem solution
strategies for applications in analysis and design problems. Our experiments
focus on using a fine-tuned model, MechGPT, developed based on training data in
the mechanics of materials domain. We first affirm how finetuning endows LLMs
with reasonable understanding of domain knowledge. However, when queried
outside the context of learned matter, LLMs can have difficulty to recall
correct information. We show how this can be addressed using
retrieval-augmented Ontological Knowledge Graph strategies that discern how the
model understands what concepts are important and how they are related.
Illustrated for a use case of relating distinct areas of knowledge - here,
music and proteins - such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph
structure with rich information at the node, edge and subgraph level. We
discuss nonlinear sampling strategies and agent-based modeling applied to
complex question answering, code generation and execution in the context of

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials discovery and design typically proceeds through iterative
evaluation (both experimental and computational) to obtain data, generally
targeting improvement of one or more properties under one or more constraints
(e.g., time or budget). However, there can be great variation in the quality
and cost of different data, and when they are mixed together in what we here
call multifidelity data the optimal approaches to their utilization are not
established. It is therefore important to develop strategies to acquire and use
multifidelity data to realize the most efficient iterative materials
exploration. In this work, we assess the impact of using multifidelity data
through mock demonstration of designing solar cell materials, using the
electronic bandgap as the target property. We propose a new approach of using
multifidelity data through leveraging machine learning models of both low- and
high-fidelity data, where using predicted low-fidelity data as an input feature
in the high-fidelity model can improve the impact of a multifidelity data
approach. We show how tradeoffs of low- versus high-fidelity measurement cost
and acquisition can impact the materials discovery process, and find that the
use of multifidelity data has maximal impact on the materials discovery
campaign when approximately five low-fidelity measurements per high-fidelity
measurement are performed, and when the cost of low-fidelity measurements is
approximately 5% or less than that of high-fidelity measurements. This work
provides practical guidance and useful qualitative measures for improving
materials discovery campaigns that involve multifidelity data.</p>

    <p>Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is the study of the influence of any given
inputs on the outputs of a model. In the context of engineering design, GSA has
been widely used to understand both individual and collective contributions of
design variables on the design objectives. So far, global sensitivity studies
have often been limited to design spaces with only quantitative (numerical)
design variables. However, many engineering systems also contain, if not only,
qualitative (categorical) design variables in addition to quantitative design
variables. In this paper, we integrate Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP)
with Sobol' analysis to develop the first metamodel-based mixed-variable GSA
method. Through numerical case studies, we validate and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method for mixed-variable problems. Furthermore,
while the proposed GSA method is general enough to benefit various engineering
design applications, we integrate it with multi-objective Bayesian optimization
(BO) to create a sensitivity-aware design framework in accelerating the Pareto
front design exploration for metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with
many-level combinatorial design spaces. Although MOFs are constructed only from
qualitative variables that are notoriously difficult to design, our method can
utilize sensitivity analysis to navigate the optimization in the many-level
large combinatorial design space, greatly expediting the exploration of novel
MOF candidates.</p>

    <p>The morphing of 3D structures is suitable for i) future tunable material
design for customizing material properties and ii) advanced manufacturing tools
for fabricating 3D structures on a 2D plane. However, there is no inverse
design method for topologically variable and volumetric morphing or morphing
with shape locking, which limits practical engineering applications. In this
study, we construct a general inverse design method for 3D architected
materials for topologically variable and volumetric morphing, whose shapes are
lockable in the morphed states, which can contribute to future tunable
materials, design, and advanced manufacturing. Volumetric mapping of bistable
unit cells onto any 3D morphing target geometry with kinematic and kinetic
modifications can produce flat-foldable and volumetric morphing structures with
shape-locking. This study presents a generalized inverse design method for 3D
metamaterial morphing that can be used for structural applications with shape
locking. Topologically variable morphing enables the manufacture of volumetric
structures on a 2D plane, saving tremendous energy and materials compared with
conventional 3D printing. Volumetric morphing can significantly expand the
design space with tunable physical properties without limiting the selection of
base materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Expanding the pool of stable halide perovskites with attractive
optoelectronic properties is crucial to addressing current limitations in their
performance as photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. In this article, we demonstrate how
a high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) dataset of halide perovskite
alloys can be used to train accurate surrogate models for property prediction
and subsequently perform inverse design using genetic algorithm (GA). Our
dataset consists of decomposition energies, band gaps, and photovoltaic
efficiencies of nearly 800 pure and mixed composition ABX$_3$ compounds from
both the GGA-PBE and HSE06 functionals, and are combined with ~ 100
experimental data points collected from the literature. Multi-fidelity random
forest regression models are trained on the DFT + experimental dataset for each
property using descriptors that one-hot encode composition, phase, and
fidelity, and additionally include well-known elemental or molecular properties
of species at the A, B, and X sites. Rigorously optimized models are deployed
for experiment-level prediction over > 150,000 hypothetical compounds, leading
to thousands of promising materials with low decomposition energy, band gap
between 1 and 2 eV, and efficiency > 15%. Surrogate models are further combined
with GA using an objective function to maintain chemical feasibility, minimize
decomposition energy, maximize PV efficiency, and keep band gap between 1 and 2
eV; hundreds more optimal compositions and phases are thus discovered. We
present an analysis of the screened and inverse-designed materials, visualize
ternary phase diagrams generated for many systems of interest using ML
predictions, and suggest strategies for further improvement and expansion in
the future.</p>

    <p>Metasurfaces have widespread applications in fifth-generation (5G) microwave
communication. Among the metasurface family, free-form metasurfaces excel in
achieving intricate spectral responses compared to regular-shape counterparts.
However, conventional numerical methods for free-form metasurfaces are
time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Alternatively, recent studies
demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to accelerate and refine
metasurface designs. Here, we present XGAN, an extended generative adversarial
network (GAN) with a surrogate for high-quality free-form metasurface designs.
The proposed surrogate provides a physical constraint to XGAN so that XGAN can
accurately generate metasurfaces monolithically from input spectral responses.
In comparative experiments involving 20000 free-form metasurface designs, XGAN
achieves 0.9734 average accuracy and is 500 times faster than the conventional
methodology. This method facilitates the metasurface library building for
specific spectral responses and can be extended to various inverse design
problems, including optical metamaterials, nanophotonic devices, and drug
discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning have shown great promise in
their ability to accelerate novel materials discovery. As researchers and
domain scientists seek to unify and consolidate chemical knowledge, the case
for models with potential to generalize across different tasks within materials
science - so-called "foundation models" - grows with ambitions. This manuscript
reviews our recent progress with development of Open MatSci ML Toolkit, and
details experiments that lay the groundwork for foundation model research and
development with our framework. First, we describe and characterize a new
pretraining task that uses synthetic data generated from symmetry operations,
and reveal complex training dynamics at large scales. Using the pretrained
model, we discuss a number of use cases relevant to foundation model
development: semantic architecture of datasets, and fine-tuning for property
prediction and classification. Our key results show that for simple
applications, pretraining appears to provide worse modeling performance than
training models from random initialization. However, for more complex
instances, such as when a model is required to learn across multiple datasets
and types of targets simultaneously, the inductive bias from pretraining
provides significantly better performance. This insight will hopefully inform
subsequent efforts into creating foundation models for materials science
applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The utility of machine learning (ML) techniques in materials science has
accelerated materials design and discovery. However, the accuracy of ML models
- particularly deep neural networks - heavily relies on the quality and
quantity of the training data. Data collection methods often have limitations
arising from cost, difficulty, and resource-intensive human efforts. Thus,
limited high-quality data, especially for novel materials, poses a significant
challenge in developing reliable ML models. Generative adversarial networks
(GANs) offer one solution to augment datasets through synthetic sample
generation. The present work explores the application of GANs in magnesium (Mg)
alloy design, by training two deep neural networks within the structure of a
Wasserstein GAN to generate new (novel) alloys with desired mechanical
properties. This data augmentation-based strategy contributes to model
robustness, particularly in cases where traditional data collection is
impractical. The approach presented may expedite Mg alloy development, through
a GAN assisted inverse design approach.</p>

to predict these chemical processes accurately. However, recent advancements in
generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including automated text generation

it through a learning process that incorporates 13,878 pieces of structured
material knowledge data. This specialized AI model, named MatChat, focuses on
predicting inorganic material synthesis pathways. MatChat exhibits remarkable
proficiency in generating and reasoning with knowledge in materials science.
Although MatChat requires further refinement to meet the diverse material
design needs, this research undeniably highlights its impressive reasoning
capabilities and innovative potential in the field of materials science.
MatChat is now accessible online and open for use, with both the model and its

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Sparse regression and feature extraction are the cornerstones of knowledge
discovery from massive data. Their goal is to discover interpretable and
predictive models that provide simple relationships among scientific variables.
While the statistical tools for model discovery are well established in the
context of linear regression, their generalization to nonlinear regression in
material modeling is highly problem-specific and insufficiently understood.
Here we explore the potential of neural networks for automatic model discovery
and induce sparsity by a hybrid approach that combines two strategies:
regularization and physical constraints. We integrate the concept of Lp
regularization for subset selection with constitutive neural networks that
leverage our domain knowledge in kinematics and thermodynamics. We train our
networks with both, synthetic and real data, and perform several thousand
discovery runs to infer common guidelines and trends: L2 regularization or
ridge regression is unsuitable for model discovery; L1 regularization or lasso
promotes sparsity, but induces strong bias; only L0 regularization allows us to
transparently fine-tune the trade-off between interpretability and
predictability, simplicity and accuracy, and bias and variance. With these
insights, we demonstrate that Lp regularized constitutive neural networks can
simultaneously discover both, interpretable models and physically meaningful
parameters. We anticipate that our findings will generalize to alternative
discovery techniques such as sparse and symbolic regression, and to other
domains such as biology, chemistry, or medicine. Our ability to automatically
discover material models from data could have tremendous applications in
generative material design and open new opportunities to manipulate matter,
alter properties of existing materials, and discover new materials with
user-defined properties.</p>

    <p>Accelerating material discovery holds the potential to greatly help mitigate
the climate crisis. Discovering new solid-state materials such as
electrocatalysts, super-ionic conductors or photovoltaic materials can have a
crucial impact, for instance, in improving the efficiency of renewable energy
production and storage. In this paper, we introduce Crystal-GFN, a generative
model of crystal structures that sequentially samples structural properties of
crystalline materials, namely the space group, composition and lattice
parameters. This domain-inspired approach enables the flexible incorporation of
physical and structural hard constraints, as well as the use of any available
predictive model of a desired physicochemical property as an objective
function. To design stable materials, one must target the candidates with the
lowest formation energy. Here, we use as objective the formation energy per
atom of a crystal structure predicted by a new proxy machine learning model
trained on MatBench. The results demonstrate that Crystal-GFN is able to sample
highly diverse crystals with low (median -3.1 eV/atom) predicted formation
energy.</p>

    <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is the de facto approach for predicting
self-consistent-field electronic structures of ground-state configurations of
complex atoms, molecules, and solids and providing their property data for
materials discovery and design. This capability is greatly enabled by the
generalized gradient approximation for exchange-correlation interactions with
an important set of exchange-correlation functionals developed by John Perdew
and his collaborators in last several decades. The scientific community and the
present author's group have greatly benefited from this capability. Over the
years, the present author's group has integrated the energetics from DFT-based
calculations both at zero K and finite temperature into thermodynamic modeling
and developed methods to predict tracer diffusivity, elastic coefficients,
interfacial energy, and a number of other properties related to the derivatives
of free energy. One key outcome is the accurate prediction of free energy of a
system through the consideration of both ground-state and stable
symmetry-breaking non-ground-state configurations. It is articulated that
phonon properties of all individual configurations can be accurately calculated
by quasiharmonic approximations in the temperature and volume ranges of
interest, and the emergent behaviors and anharmonicity of a system originate
primarily from the statistical competition among all the configurations.</p>

    <p>Scientific discovery and engineering design are currently limited by the time
and cost of physical experiments, selected mostly through trial-and-error and
intuition that require deep domain expertise. Numerical simulations present an
alternative to physical experiments but are usually infeasible for complex
real-world domains due to the computational requirements of existing numerical
methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a potential paradigm shift by
developing fast data-driven surrogate models. In particular, an AI framework,
known as Neural Operators, presents a principled framework for learning
mappings between functions defined on continuous domains, e.g., spatiotemporal
processes and partial differential equations (PDE). They can extrapolate and
predict solutions at new locations unseen during training, i.e., perform
zero-shot super-resolution. Neural Operators can augment or even replace
existing simulators in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics,
weather forecasting, and material modeling, while being 4-5 orders of magnitude
faster. Further, Neural Operators can be integrated with physics and other
domain constraints enforced at finer resolutions to obtain high-fidelity
solutions and good generalization. Since Neural Operators are differentiable,
they can directly optimize parameters for inverse design and other inverse
problems. We believe that Neural Operators present a transformative approach to
simulation and design, enabling rapid research and development.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The study of biological materials and bio-inspired materials science is well
established; however, surprisingly little knowledge has been systematically
translated to engineering solutions. To accelerate discovery and guide
insights, an open-source autoregressive transformer large language model (LLM),
BioinspiredLLM, is reported. The model was finetuned with a corpus of over a
thousand peer-reviewed articles in the field of structural biological and
bio-inspired materials and can be prompted to recall information, assist with
research tasks, and function as an engine for creativity. The model has proven
that it is able to accurately recall information about biological materials and
is further enhanced with enhanced reasoning ability, as well as with
retrieval-augmented generation to incorporate new data during generation that
can also help to traceback sources, update the knowledge base, and connect
knowledge domains. BioinspiredLLM also has been shown to develop sound
hypotheses regarding biological materials design and remarkably so for
materials that have never been explicitly studied before. Lastly, the model
showed impressive promise in collaborating with other generative artificial
intelligence models in a workflow that can reshape the traditional materials
design process. This collaborative generative artificial intelligence method
can stimulate and enhance bio-inspired materials design workflows. Biological
materials are at a critical intersection of multiple scientific fields and
models like BioinspiredLLM help to connect knowledge domains.</p>

    <p>The integration of robots in chemical experiments has enhanced experimental
efficiency, but lacking the human intelligence to comprehend literature, they
seldom provide assistance in experimental design. Therefore, achieving
full-process autonomy from experiment design to validation in self-driven
laboratories (SDL) remains a challenge. The introduction of Generative
Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly GPT-4, into robotic
experimentation offers a solution. We introduce GPT-Lab, a paradigm that
employs GPT models to give robots human-like intelligence. With our robotic
experimentation platform, GPT-Lab mines literature for materials and methods
and validates findings through high-throughput synthesis. As a demonstration,
GPT-Lab analyzed 500 articles, identified 18 potential reagents, and
successfully produced an accurate humidity colorimetric sensor with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of 2.68%. This showcases the rapid materials discovery and
validation potential of our system.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>With their celebrated structural and chemical flexibility, perovskite oxides
have served as a highly adaptable material platform for exploring emergent
phenomena arising from the interplay between different degrees of freedom.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations leveraging classical force fields, commonly
depicted as parameterized analytical functions, have made significant
contributions in elucidating the atomistic dynamics and structural properties
of crystalline solids including perovskite oxides. However, the force fields
currently available for solids are rather specific and offer limited
transferability, making it time-consuming to use MD to study new materials
systems since a new force field must be parameterized and tested first. The
lack of a generalized force field applicable to a broad spectrum of solid
materials hinders the facile deployment of MD in computer-aided materials
discovery (CAMD). Here, by utilizing a deep-neural network with a
self-attention scheme, we have developed a unified force field that enables MD
simulations of perovskite oxides involving 14 metal elements and conceivably
their solid solutions with arbitrary compositions. Notably, isobaric-isothermal
ensemble MD simulations with this model potential accurately predict the
experimental phase transition sequences for several markedly different
ferroelectric oxides, including a 6-element ternary solid solution,
Pb(In$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$--Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$--PbTiO$_3$. We
believe the universal interatomic potential along with the training database,
proposed regression tests, and the auto-testing workflow, all released
publicly, will pave the way for a systematic improvement and extension of a
unified force field for solids, potentially heralding a new era in CAMD.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly popular for predicting
material properties to accelerate materials discovery. Because material
properties are strongly affected by its crystal structure, a key issue is
converting the crystal structure into the features for input to the ML model.
Currently, the most common method is to convert the crystal structure into a
graph and predicting its properties using a graph neural network (GNN). Some
GNN models, such as crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) and
atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN), have achieved highly accurate
predictions of material properties. Despite these successes, using a graph to
represent a crystal structure has the notable limitation of losing the crystal
structure's three-dimensional (3D) information. In this work, we propose
DeepCrysTet, a novel deep learning approach for predicting material properties,
which uses crystal structures represented as a 3D tetrahedral mesh generated by
Delaunay tetrahedralization. DeepCrysTet provides a useful framework that
includes a 3D mesh generation method, mesh-based feature design, and neural
network design. The experimental results using the Materials Project dataset
show that DeepCrysTet significantly outperforms existing GNN models in
classifying crystal structures and achieves state-of-the-art performance in
predicting elastic properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In the last decades, material discovery has been a very active research field
driven by the need to find new materials for many different applications. This
has also included materials with heavy elements, beyond the stable isotopes of
lead, as most actinides exhibit unique properties that make them useful in
various applications. Furthermore, new heavy elements beyond actinides,
collectively referred to as super-heavy elements (SHEs), have been synthesized,
filling previously empty space of Mendeleev periodic table. Their chemical
bonding behavior, of academic interest at present, would also benefit of
state-of-the-art modeling approaches. In particular, in order to perform
first-principles calculations with planewave basis sets, one needs
corresponding pseudopotentials. In this work, we present a series of scalar-
and fully-relativistic optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials
(ONCVPs) for thirty-four actinides and super-heavy elements, for three
different exchange-correlation functionals (PBE, PBEsol and LDA). The
scalar-relativistic version of these ONCVPs is tested by comparing equations of
states for crystals, obtained with \textsc{abinit} 9.6, with those obtained by
all-electron zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) calculations, without
spin-orbit coupling, performed with the Amsterdam Modeling Suite \textsc{band}
code. $\Delta$-Gauge and $\Delta_1$-Gauge indicators are used to validate these
pseudopotentials. This work is a contribution to the PseudoDojo project, in
which pseudopotentials for the whole periodic table are developed and
systematically tested. The pseudopotential files are available on the
PseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org in psp8 and UPF2 formats, both
suitable for \textsc{abinit}, the latter being also suitable for Quantum
ESPRESSO.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Inverse design refers to the problem of optimizing the input of an objective
function in order to enact a target outcome. For many real-world engineering
problems, the objective function takes the form of a simulator that predicts
how the system state will evolve over time, and the design challenge is to
optimize the initial conditions that lead to a target outcome. Recent
developments in learned simulation have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs)
can be used for accurate, efficient, differentiable estimation of simulator
dynamics, and support high-quality design optimization with gradient- or
sampling-based optimization procedures. However, optimizing designs from
scratch requires many expensive model queries, and these procedures exhibit
basic failures on either non-convex or high-dimensional problems. In this work,
we show how denoising diffusion models (DDMs) can be used to solve inverse
design problems efficiently and propose a particle sampling algorithm for
further improving their efficiency. We perform experiments on a number of fluid
dynamics design challenges, and find that our approach substantially reduces
the number of calls to the simulator compared to standard techniques.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A machine learning approach is presented to accelerate the computation of
block polymer morphology evolution for large domains over long timescales. The
strategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained
particle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over
mesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed
approach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly
from particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different
boundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate
boundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced
via the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.
The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial
intelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over
time. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long
trajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under
different types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the
importance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle
diffusion inside a single block. This work has implications for directed
self-assembly and materials design in micro-electronics, battery materials, and
membranes.</p>

    <p>Surrogate model-based optimization has been increasingly used in the field of
engineering design. It involves creating a surrogate model with objective
functions or constraints based on the data obtained from simulations or
real-world experiments, and then finding the optimal solution from the model
using numerical optimization methods. Recent advancements in deep
learning-based inverse design methods have made it possible to generate
real-time optimal solutions for engineering design problems, eliminating the
requirement for iterative optimization processes. Nevertheless, no
comprehensive study has yet closely examined the specific advantages and
disadvantages of this novel approach compared to the traditional design
optimization method. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance
of traditional design optimization methods with deep learning-based inverse
design methods by employing benchmark problems across various scenarios. Based
on the findings of this study, we provide guidelines that can be taken into
account for the future utilization of deep learning-based inverse design. It is
anticipated that these guidelines will enhance the practical applicability of
this approach to real engineering design problems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Robotics and automation offer massive accelerations for solving intractable,
multivariate scientific problems such as materials discovery, but the available
search spaces can be dauntingly large. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged
as a popular sample-efficient optimization engine, thriving in tasks where no
analytic form of the target function/property is known. Here, we exploit expert
human knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches more
quickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have used
underlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, which
is unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributions
cannot capture intricate hypotheses. Our proposed method, which we call HypBO,
uses expert human hypotheses to generate improved seed samples. Unpromising
seeds are automatically discounted, while promising seeds are used to augment
the surrogate model data, thus achieving better-informed sampling. This process
continues in a global versus local search fashion, organized in a bilevel
optimization framework. We validate the performance of our method on a range of
synthetic functions and demonstrate its practical utility on a real chemical
design task where the use of expert hypotheses accelerates the search
performance significantly.</p>

    <p>Information extraction and textual comprehension from materials literature
are vital for developing an exhaustive knowledge base that enables accelerated

answer domain-specific questions and retrieve information from knowledge bases.
However, there are no benchmark datasets in the materials domain that can
evaluate the understanding of the key concepts by these language models. In
this work, we curate a dataset of 650 challenging questions from the materials
domain that require the knowledge and skills of a materials student who has
cleared their undergraduate degree. We classify these questions based on their
structure and the materials science domain-based subcategories. Further, we
evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models on solving these questions
via zero-shot and chain of thought prompting. It is observed that GPT-4 gives
the best performance (~62% accuracy) as compared to GPT-3.5. Interestingly, in
contrast to the general observation, no significant improvement in accuracy is
observed with the chain of thought prompting. To evaluate the limitations, we
performed an error analysis, which revealed conceptual errors (~64%) as the
major contributor compared to computational errors (~36%) towards the reduced
performance of LLMs. We hope that the dataset and analysis performed in this
work will promote further research in developing better materials science

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Most group fairness notions detect unethical biases by computing statistical
parity metrics on a model's output. However, this approach suffers from several
shortcomings, such as philosophical disagreement, mutual incompatibility, and
lack of interpretability. These shortcomings have spurred the research on
complementary bias detection methods that offer additional transparency into
the sources of discrimination and are agnostic towards an a priori decision on
the definition of fairness and choice of protected features. A recent proposal
in this direction is LUCID (Locating Unfairness through Canonical Inverse
Design), where canonical sets are generated by performing gradient descent on
the input space, revealing a model's desired input given a preferred output.
This information about the model's mechanisms, i.e., which feature values are
essential to obtain specific outputs, allows exposing potential unethical
biases in its internal logic. Here, we present LUCID-GAN, which generates
canonical inputs via a conditional generative model instead of gradient-based
inverse design. LUCID-GAN has several benefits, including that it applies to
non-differentiable models, ensures that canonical sets consist of realistic
inputs, and allows to assess proxy and intersectional discrimination. We
empirically evaluate LUCID-GAN on the UCI Adult and COMPAS data sets and show
that it allows for detecting unethical biases in black-box models without
requiring access to the training data.</p>

Here, we explore a non-equilibrium approach to lift degeneracies in solids. We
show that coherent driving of the crystal lattice in bi- and multilayer
graphene, boosts the coupling between two doubly-degenerate modes of E1u and
E2g symmetry, which are virtually uncoupled at equilibrium. New vibronic states
result from anharmonic driving of the E1u mode to large amplitdues, boosting
its coupling to the E2g mode. The vibrational structure of the driven state is
probed with time-resolved Raman scattering, which reveals laser-field dependent
mode splitting and enhanced lifetimes. We expect this phenomenon to be
generally observable in many materials systems, affecting the non-equilibrium
emergent phases in matter.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>It is well known that the inverse design of terahertz (THz) multi-resonant
graphene metasurfaces by using traditional deep neural networks (DNNs) has
limited generalization ability. In this paper, we propose improved Transformer
and conditional generative adversarial neural networks (CGAN) for the inverse
design of graphene metasurfaces based upon THz multi-resonant absorption
spectra. The improved Transformer can obtain higher accuracy and generalization
performance in the StoV (Spectrum to Vector) design compared to traditional
multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, while the StoI (Spectrum to Image)
design achieved through CGAN can provide more comprehensive information and
higher accuracy than the StoV design obtained by MLP. Moreover, the improved
CGAN can achieve the inverse design of graphene metasurface images directly
from the desired multi-resonant absorption spectra. It is turned out that this
work can finish facilitating the design process of artificial
intelligence-generated metasurfaces (AIGM), and even provide a useful guide for
developing complex THz metasurfaces based on 2D materials using generative
neural networks.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a pipeline for predicting mechanical properties of
vertically-oriented carbon nanotube (CNT) forest images using a deep learning
model for artificial intelligence (AI)-based materials discovery. Our approach
incorporates an innovative data augmentation technique that involves the use of
multi-layer synthetic (MLS) or quasi-2.5D images which are generated by
blending 2D synthetic images. The MLS images more closely resemble 3D synthetic
and real scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CNTs but without the
computational cost of performing expensive 3D simulations or experiments.
Mechanical properties such as stiffness and buckling load for the MLS images
are estimated using a physics-based model. The proposed deep learning
architecture, CNTNeXt, builds upon our previous CNTNet neural network, using a
ResNeXt feature representation followed by random forest regression estimator.
Our machine learning approach for predicting CNT physical properties by
utilizing a blended set of synthetic images is expected to outperform single
synthetic image-based learning when it comes to predicting mechanical
properties of real scanning electron microscopy images. This has the potential
to accelerate understanding and control of CNT forest self-assembly for diverse
applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Corrosion has a wide impact on society, causing catastrophic damage to
structurally engineered components. An emerging class of corrosion-resistant
materials are high-entropy alloys. However, high-entropy alloys live in
high-dimensional composition and configuration space, making materials designs
via experimental trial-and-error or brute-force ab initio calculations almost
impossible. Here we develop a physics-informed machine-learning framework to
identify corrosion-resistant high-entropy alloys. Three metrics are used to
evaluate the corrosion resistance, including single-phase formability, surface
energy and Pilling-Bedworth ratios. We used random forest models to predict the
single-phase formability, trained on an experimental dataset. Machine learning
inter-atomic potentials were employed to calculate surface energies and
Pilling-Bedworth ratios, which are trained on first-principles data fast
sampled using embedded atom models. A combination of random forest models and
high-fidelity machine learning potentials represents the first of its kind to
relate chemical compositions to corrosion resistance of high-entropy alloys,
paving the way for automatic design of materials with superior corrosion
protection. This framework was demonstrated on AlCrFeCoNi high-entropy alloys
and we identified composition regions with high corrosion resistance. Machine
learning predicted lattice constants and surface energies are consistent with
values by first-principles calculations. The predicted single-phase formability
and corrosion-resistant compositions of AlCrFeCoNi agree well with experiments.
This framework is general in its application and applicable to other materials,
enabling high-throughput screening of material candidates and potentially
reducing the turnaround time for integrated computational materials
engineering.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Some magnetic systems display a shift in the center of their magnetic
hysteresis loop away from zero field, a phenomenon termed exchange bias.
Despite the extensive use of the exchange bias effect, particularly in magnetic
multilayers, for the design of spin-based memory/electronics devices, a
comprehensive mechanistic understanding of this effect remains a longstanding
problem. Recent work has shown that disorder-induced spin frustration might
play a key role in exchange bias, suggesting new materials design approaches
for spin-based electronic devices that harness this effect. Here, we design a
spin glass with strong spin frustration induced by magnetic disorder by
exploiting the distinctive structure of Fe intercalated ZrSe2, where Fe(II)
centers are shown to occupy both octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites
and to distribute between ZrSe2 layers without long-range structural order.
Notably, we observe behavior consistent with a magnetically frustrated, and
multi-degenerate ground state in these Fe0.17ZrSe2 single crystals, which
persists above room temperature. Moreover, this magnetic frustration leads to a
robust and tunable exchange bias up to 250 K. These results not only offer
important insights into the effects of magnetic disorder and frustration in
magnetic materials generally, but also highlight as design strategy the idea
that a large exchange bias can arise from an inhomogeneous microscopic
environment without discernible long-range magnetic order. In addition, these
results show that intercalated TMDs like Fe0.17ZrSe2 hold potential for
spintronics technologies that can achieve room temperature applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The optimization of the electrode manufacturing process is important for
upscaling the application of Lithium Ion Batteries (LIBs) to cater for growing
energy demand. In particular, LIB manufacturing is very important to be
optimized because it determines the practical performance of the cells when the
latter are being used in applications such as electric vehicles. In this study,
we tackled the issue of high-performance electrodes for desired battery
application conditions by proposing a powerful data-driven approach supported
by a deterministic machine learning (ML)-assisted pipeline for bi-objective
optimization of the electrochemical performance. This ML pipeline allows the
inverse design of the process parameters to adopt in order to manufacture
electrodes for energy or power applications. The latter work is an analogy to
our previous work that supported the optimization of the electrode
microstructures for kinetic, ionic, and electronic transport properties
improvement. An electrochemical pseudo-two-dimensional model is fed with the
electrode properties characterizing the electrode microstructures generated by
manufacturing simulations and used to simulate the electrochemical
performances. Secondly, the resulting dataset was used to train a deterministic
ML model to implement fast bi-objective optimizations to identify optimal
electrodes. Our results suggested a high amount of active material, combined
with intermediate values of solid content in the slurry and calendering degree,
to achieve the optimal electrodes.</p>

    <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to learn sophisticated control
policies for complex tasks including games, robotics, heating and cooling
systems and text generation. The action-perception cycle in RL, however,
generally assumes that a measurement of the state of the environment is
available at each time step without a cost. In applications such as materials
design, deep-sea and planetary robot exploration and medicine, however, there
can be a high cost associated with measuring, or even approximating, the state
of the environment. In this paper, we survey the recently growing literature
that adopts the perspective that an RL agent might not need, or even want, a
costly measurement at each time step. Within this context, we propose the Deep
Dynamic Multi-Step Observationless Agent (DMSOA), contrast it with the
literature and empirically evaluate it on OpenAI gym and Atari Pong
environments. Our results, show that DMSOA learns a better policy with fewer
decision steps and measurements than the considered alternative from the
literature.</p>

    <p>Metamaterials are artificial materials designed to exhibit effective material

rich designability that are assembled into multiscale systems, they hold great

instead of specific domains and deployment contexts. We organize existing
research into data-driven modules, encompassing data acquisition, machine
learning-based unit cell design, and data-driven multiscale optimization. We
further categorize the approaches within each module based on shared
principles, analyze and compare strengths and applicability, explore
connections between different modules, and identify open research questions and

    <p>We report a flexible multi-modal mechanics language model, MeLM, applied to
solve various nonlinear forward and inverse problems, that can deal with a set
of instructions, numbers and microstructure data. The framework is applied to
various examples including bio-inspired hierarchical honeycomb design, carbon
nanotube mechanics, and protein unfolding. In spite of the flexible nature of
the model-which allows us to easily incorporate diverse materials, scales, and
mechanical features-it performs well across disparate forward and inverse
tasks. Based on an autoregressive attention-model, MeLM effectively represents
a large multi-particle system consisting of hundreds of millions of neurons,
where the interaction potentials are discovered through graph-forming
self-attention mechanisms that are then used to identify relationships from
emergent structures, while taking advantage of synergies discovered in the
training data. We show that the model can solve complex degenerate mechanics
design problems and determine novel material architectures across a range of
hierarchical levels, providing an avenue for materials discovery and analysis.
Looking beyond the demonstrations reported in this paper, we discuss other
opportunities in applied mechanics and general considerations about the use of
large language models in modeling, design, and analysis that can span a broad
spectrum of material properties from mechanical, thermal, optical, to
electronic.</p>

    <p>With the availability of extensive databases of inorganic materials,

of data-driven concepts to the mapping and exploration of chemical compound
space. Recommender systems, widely utilized for suggesting items to users,
employ techniques such as collaborative filtering, which rely on bipartite
graphs composed of users, items, and their interactions. Building upon the Open
Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), we constructed a bipartite graph where
elements from the periodic table and sites within crystal structures are
treated as separate entities. The relationships between them, defined by the
presence of ions at specific sites and weighted according to the thermodynamic
stability of the respective compounds, allowed us to generate an embedding
space that contains vector representations for each ion and each site. Through
the correlation of ion-site occupancy with their respective distances within
the embedding space, we explored new ion-site occupancies, facilitating the
discovery of novel stable compounds. Moreover, the graph's embedding space
enabled a comprehensive examination of chemical similarities among elements,
and a detailed analysis of local geometries of sites. To demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our method, we conducted a historical
evaluation using different versions of the OQMD and recommended new compounds
with Kagome lattices, showcasing the applicability of our approach to practical

    <p>The sustainable development of next-generation device technology is paramount
in the face of climate change and the looming energy crisis. Tremendous efforts

device-level sustainability, where high performance and low operational energy

The role of material-level sustainability in computational screening efforts
remains an open question thus far. Here we develop a general van der Waals

criteria. Using ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) materials as a backdrop -- an emerging
materials class with great prospects in dielectric, power electronics, and
ultraviolet device applications, we demonstrate how this screening framework
results in 25 sustainable UWBG layered materials comprising only of low-risks

    <p>In the last decades, the capacity to generate large amounts of data in
science and engineering applications has been growing steadily. Meanwhile,
machine learning has progressed to become a suitable tool to process and
utilise the available data. Nonetheless, many relevant scientific and
engineering problems present challenges where current machine learning methods
cannot yet efficiently leverage the available data and resources. For example,
in scientific discovery, we are often faced with the problem of exploring very
large, structured and high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, the high fidelity,
black-box objective function is often very expensive to evaluate. Progress in
machine learning methods that can efficiently tackle such challenges would help
accelerate currently crucial areas such as drug and materials discovery. In
this paper, we propose a multi-fidelity active learning algorithm with
GFlowNets as a sampler, to efficiently discover diverse, high-scoring
candidates where multiple approximations of the black-box function are
available at lower fidelity and cost. Our evaluation on molecular discovery
tasks shows that multi-fidelity active learning with GFlowNets can discover
high-scoring candidates at a fraction of the budget of its single-fidelity
counterpart while maintaining diversity, unlike RL-based alternatives. These
results open new avenues for multi-fidelity active learning to accelerate
scientific discovery and engineering design.</p>

    <p>Materials discovery, especially for applications that require extreme

ability to inquire the wealth of possible compositions. Machine Learning (ML)
has nowadays a well established role in facilitating this effort in systematic
ways. The increasing amount of available accurate DFT data represents a solid

models rely on static descriptors, generally suitable for a limited class of
systems, the flexibility of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) allows for direct
learning representations on graphs, such as the ones formed by crystals. We
utilize crystal graph neural networks (CGNN) to predict crystal properties with
DFT level accuracy, through graphs with encoding of the atomic (node/vertex),
bond (edge), and global state attributes. In this work, we aim at testing the
ability of the CGNN MegNet framework in predicting a number of properties of
systems previously unseen from the model, obtained by adding a substitutional
defect in bulk crystals that are included in the training set. We perform DFT

is highly desired, as it is the most important and fundamental physical
quantity that determines the quantum states of physical systems and chemical
properties. In this work, we generate a new Quantum Hamiltonian dataset, named
as QH9, to provide precise Hamiltonian matrices for 999 or 2998 molecular
dynamics trajectories and 130,831 stable molecular geometries, based on the QM9
dataset. By designing benchmark tasks with various molecules, we show that
current machine learning models have the capacity to predict Hamiltonian
matrices for arbitrary molecules. Both the QH9 dataset and the baseline models
are provided to the community through an open-source benchmark, which can be
highly valuable for developing machine learning methods and accelerating
molecular and materials design for scientific and technological applications.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence for scientific discovery has recently generated
significant interest within the machine learning and scientific communities,
particularly in the domains of chemistry, biology, and material discovery. For
these scientific problems, molecules serve as the fundamental building blocks,
and machine learning has emerged as a highly effective and powerful tool for
modeling their geometric structures. Nevertheless, due to the rapidly evolving
process of the field and the knowledge gap between science (e.g., physics,
chemistry, & biology) and machine learning communities, a benchmarking study on
geometrical representation for such data has not been conducted. To address
such an issue, in this paper, we first provide a unified view of the current
symmetry-informed geometric methods, classifying them into three main
categories: invariance, equivariance with spherical frame basis, and
equivariance with vector frame basis. Then we propose a platform, coined
Geom3D, which enables benchmarking the effectiveness of geometric strategies.
Geom3D contains 16 advanced symmetry-informed geometric representation models
and 14 geometric pretraining methods over 46 diverse datasets, including small
molecules, proteins, and crystalline materials. We hope that Geom3D can, on the
one hand, eliminate barriers for machine learning researchers interested in
exploring scientific problems; and, on the other hand, provide valuable
guidance for researchers in computational chemistry, structural biology, and
materials science, aiding in the informed selection of representation
techniques for specific applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We introduce M$^2$Hub, a toolkit for advancing machine learning in materials
discovery. Machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in modeling
molecular structures, especially biomolecules for drug discovery. However, the
development of machine learning approaches for modeling materials structures
lag behind, which is partly due to the lack of an integrated platform that
enables access to diverse tasks for materials discovery. To bridge this gap,
M$^2$Hub will enable easy access to materials discovery tasks, datasets,
machine learning methods, evaluations, and benchmark results that cover the
entire workflow. Specifically, the first release of M$^2$Hub focuses on three
key stages in materials discovery: virtual screening, inverse design, and
molecular simulation, including 9 datasets that covers 6 types of materials
with 56 tasks across 8 types of material properties. We further provide 2
synthetic datasets for the purpose of generative tasks on materials. In
addition to random data splits, we also provide 3 additional data partitions to
reflect the real-world materials discovery scenarios. State-of-the-art machine
learning methods (including those are suitable for materials structures but
never compared in the literature) are benchmarked on representative tasks. Our
codes and library are publicly available at https://github.com/yuanqidu/M2Hub.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recently, message-passing Neural networks (MPNN) provide a promising tool for
dealing with molecular graphs and have achieved remarkable success in
facilitating the discovery and materials design with desired properties.
However, the classical MPNN methods also suffer from a limitation in capturing
the strong topological information hidden in molecular structures, such as
nonisomorphic graphs. To address this problem, this work proposes a Simplicial
Message Passing (SMP) framework to better capture the topological information
from molecules, which can break through the limitation within the vanilla
message-passing paradigm. In SMP, a generalized message-passing framework is
established for aggregating the information from arbitrary-order simplicial
complex, and a hierarchical structure is elaborated to allow information
exchange between different order simplices. We apply the SMP framework within
deep learning architectures for quantum-chemical properties prediction and
achieve state-of-the-art results. The results show that compared to traditional
MPNN, involving higher-order simplex can better capture the complex structure
of molecules and substantially enhance the performance of tasks. The SMP-based
model can provide a generalized framework for GNNs and aid in the discovery and
design of materials with tailored properties for various applications.</p>

    <p>Graph neural networks are widely used in machine learning applied to
chemistry, and in particular for material science discovery. For crystalline
materials, however, generating graph-based representation from geometrical
information for neural networks is not a trivial task. The periodicity of
crystalline needs efficient implementations to be processed in real-time under
a massively parallel environment. With the aim of training graph-based
generative models of new material discovery, we propose an efficient tool to
generate cutoff graphs and k-nearest-neighbours graphs of periodic structures
within GPU optimization. We provide pyMatGraph a Pytorch-compatible framework
to generate graphs in real-time during the training of neural network
architecture. Our tool can update a graph of a structure, making generative
models able to update the geometry and process the updated graph during the
forward propagation on the GPU side. Our code is publicly available at

    <p>Metastable materials are abundant in nature and technology, showcasing
remarkable properties that inspire innovative materials design. However,
traditional crystal structure prediction methods, which rely solely on
energetic factors to determine a structure's fitness, are not suitable for
predicting the vast number of potentially synthesizable phases that represent a
local minimum corresponding to a state in thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we
present a new approach for the prediction of metastable phases with specific
structural features, and interface this method with the XtalOpt evolutionary
algorithm. Our method relies on structural features that include the local
crystalline order (e.g., the coordination number or chemical environment), and
symmetry (e.g., Bravais lattice and space group) to filter the parent pool of
an evolutionary crystal structure search. The effectiveness of this approach is
benchmarked on three known metastable systems: XeN$_8$, with a two-dimensional
polymeric nitrogen sublattice, brookite TiO$_2$, and a high pressure BaH$_4$
phase that was recently characterized. Additionally, a newly predicted
metastable melaminate salt, $P$-1 WC$_{3}$N$_{6}$, was found to possess an
energy that is lower than two phases proposed in a recent computational study.
The method presented here could help in identifying the structures of compounds
that have already been synthesized, and developing new synthesis targets with
desired properties.</p>

    <p>A popular approach to protein design is to combine a generative model with a
discriminative model for conditional sampling. The generative model samples
plausible sequences while the discriminative model guides a search for
sequences with high fitness. Given its broad success in conditional sampling,
classifier-guided diffusion modeling is a promising foundation for protein
design, leading many to develop guided diffusion models for structure with
inverse folding to recover sequences. In this work, we propose diffusioN
Optimized Sampling (NOS), a guidance method for discrete diffusion models that
follows gradients in the hidden states of the denoising network. NOS makes it
possible to perform design directly in sequence space, circumventing
significant limitations of structure-based methods, including scarce data and
challenging inverse design. Moreover, we use NOS to generalize LaMBO, a
Bayesian optimization procedure for sequence design that facilitates multiple
objectives and edit-based constraints. The resulting method, LaMBO-2, enables
discrete diffusions and stronger performance with limited edits through a novel
application of saliency maps. We apply LaMBO-2 to a real-world protein design
task, optimizing antibodies for higher expression yield and binding affinity to
several therapeutic targets under locality and developability constraints,
attaining a 99% expression rate and 40% binding rate in exploratory in vitro
experiments.</p>

    <p>Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where
sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure
without considering 3D conformational diversity. We introduce gRNAde, a
geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences
that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. gRNAde uses a multi-state
Graph Neural Network and autoregressive decoding to generates candidate RNA
sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the
identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design
benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. (2010),
gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared
to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared
to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde
on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as
well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective
analysis of a recent ribozyme. Experimental wet lab validation on 10 different
structured RNA backbones finds that gRNAde has a success rate of 50% at
designing pseudoknotted RNA structures, a significant advance over 35% for
Rosetta. Open source code and tutorials are available at:

density functional theory. In DFT-II, we focus on fundamentals of DFT and their
implications for the betterment of the theory. We start our presentation with
the exact DFT result followed by the concept of exchange-correlation (xc) or
Fermi-Coulomb hole and its relation with xc energy functional. We also provide
the exact conditions for the xc-hole, xc-energy and xc-potential along with
their physical interpretation. Next, we describe the extension of DFT for
non-integer numbers of electrons, the piecewise linearity of total energy and
discontinuity of chemical potential at integer particle numbers, and derivative
discontinuity of the xc potential, which has consequences on fundamental gap of
solids. After that, we present how one obtain more accurate xc energy
functionals by going beyond LDA. We discuss the gradient expansion
approximation (GEA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and hybrid
functional approaches to designing better xc energy functionals that give
accurate total energies but fail to predict properties like the ionization
potential and the band gap. Thus, we describe different methods of modeling
these potentials and the results of their application for the calculation of
the band gaps of different solids to highlight accuracy of different xc

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Molecular representation learning is a crucial task in predicting molecular
properties. Molecules are often modeled as graphs where atoms and chemical
bonds are represented as nodes and edges, respectively, and Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have been commonly utilized to predict atom-related properties,
such as reactivity and solubility. However, functional groups (subgraphs) are
closely related to some chemical properties of molecules, such as efficacy, and
metabolic properties, which cannot be solely determined by individual atoms. In
this paper, we introduce a new model for molecular representation learning
called the Atomic and Subgraph-aware Bilateral Aggregation (ASBA), which
addresses the limitations of previous atom-wise and subgraph-wise models by
incorporating both types of information. ASBA consists of two branches, one for
atom-wise information and the other for subgraph-wise information. Considering
existing atom-wise GNNs cannot properly extract invariant subgraph features, we
propose a decomposition-polymerization GNN architecture for the subgraph-wise
branch. Furthermore, we propose cooperative node-level and graph-level
self-supervised learning strategies for ASBA to improve its generalization. Our
method offers a more comprehensive way to learn representations for molecular
property prediction and has broad potential in drug and material discovery
applications. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
method.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Developing methods to understand and control defect formation in
nanomaterials offers a promising route for materials discovery. Monolayer MX2
phases represent a particularly compelling case for defect engineering of
nanomaterials due to the large variability in their physical properties as
different defects are introduced into their structure. However, effective
identification and quantification of defects remains a challenge even as
high-throughput scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM) methods improve.
This study highlights the benefits of employing first principles calculations
to produce digital twins for training deep learning segmentation models for
defect identification in monolayer MX2 phases. Around 600 defect structures
were obtained using density functional theory calculations, with each monolayer
MX2 structure being subjected to multislice simulations for the purpose of
generating the digital twins. Several deep learning segmentation architectures
were trained on this dataset, and their performances evaluated under a variety
of conditions such as recognizing defects in the presence of unidentified
impurities, beam damage, grain boundaries, and with reduced image quality from
low electron doses. This digital twin approach allows benchmarking different
deep learning architectures on a theory dataset, which enables the study of
defect classification under a broad array of finely controlled conditions. It
thus opens the door to resolving the underpinning physical reasons for model
shortcomings, and potentially chart paths forward for automated discovery of
materials defect phases in experiments.</p>

first recalls relevant candidates, and next ranks the candidates based on
multiple target properties. The contextual knowledge encoded in language
representations conveys information about material properties and structures,
enabling both representational similarity analysis for recall, and multi-task
learning to share information across related properties. By applying the
framework to thermoelectrics, we demonstrate diversified recommendations of
prototype structures and identify under-studied high-performance material
spaces. The recommended materials are corroborated by first-principles
calculations and experiments, revealing novel materials with potential high
performance. Our framework provides a task-agnostic means for effective
material recommendation and can be applied to various material systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Molecule generation is a very important practical problem, with uses in drug
discovery and material design, and AI methods promise to provide useful
solutions. However, existing methods for molecule generation focus either on 2D
graph structure or on 3D geometric structure, which is not sufficient to
represent a complete molecule as 2D graph captures mainly topology while 3D
geometry captures mainly spatial atom arrangements. Combining these
representations is essential to better represent a molecule. In this paper, we
present a new model for generating a comprehensive representation of molecules,
including atom features, 2D discrete molecule structures, and 3D continuous
molecule coordinates, by combining discrete and continuous diffusion processes.
The use of diffusion processes allows for capturing the probabilistic nature of
molecular processes and exploring the effect of different factors on molecular
structures. Additionally, we propose a novel graph transformer architecture to
denoise the diffusion process. The transformer adheres to 3D roto-translation
equivariance constraints, allowing it to learn invariant atom and edge
representations while preserving the equivariance of atom coordinates. This
transformer can be used to learn molecular representations robust to geometric
transformations. We evaluate the performance of our model through experiments
and comparisons with existing methods, showing its ability to generate more
stable and valid molecules. Our model is a promising approach for designing
stable and diverse molecules and can be applied to a wide range of tasks in
molecular modeling.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is concerned with the development of
learned emulators of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations (PDE). In application domains such as weather forecasting, molecular
dynamics, and inverse design, ML-based surrogate models are increasingly used
to augment or replace inefficient and often non-differentiable numerical
simulation algorithms. While a number of ML-based methods for approximating the
solutions of PDEs have been proposed in recent years, they typically do not
adapt to the parameters of the PDEs, making it difficult to generalize to PDE
parameters not seen during training. We propose a Channel Attention mechanism
guided by PDE Parameter Embeddings (CAPE) component for neural surrogate models
and a simple yet effective curriculum learning strategy. The CAPE module can be
combined with neural PDE solvers allowing them to adapt to unseen PDE
parameters. The curriculum learning strategy provides a seamless transition
between teacher-forcing and fully auto-regressive training. We compare CAPE in
conjunction with the curriculum learning strategy using a popular PDE benchmark
and obtain consistent and significant improvements over the baseline models.
The experiments also show several advantages of CAPE, such as its increased
ability to generalize to unseen PDE parameters without large increases
inference time and parameter count.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Traditional solid-state physics has long correlated the optical properties of
materials with their electronic structures. However, recent discoveries of
intrinsic gapped metals have challenged this classical view. Gapped metals
possess electronic properties distinct from both metals and insulators, with a
large concentration of free carriers without any intentional doping and an
internal band gap. This unique electronic structure makes gapped metals
potentially superior to materials designed by intentional doping of the wide
band gap insulators. Despite their promising applications, such as transparent
conductors, designing gapped metals for specific purposes remains challenging
due to the lack of understanding of the correlation between their electronic
band structures and optical properties. This study focuses on representative
examples of gapped metals and demonstrates the cases of (i) gapped metals
(e.g., CaN2) with strong intraband absorption in the visible range, (ii) gapped
metals (e.g., SrNbO3) with strong interband absorption in the visible range,
(iii) gapped metals (e.g., Sr5Nb5O17) that are potential transparent
conductors. We explore the complexity of identifying potential gapped metals
for transparent conductors and propose inverse materials design principles for
discovering new-generation transparent conductors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Conventional meta-atom designs rely heavily on researchers' prior knowledge
and trial-and-error searches using full-wave simulations, resulting in
time-consuming and inefficient processes. Inverse design methods based on
optimization algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms, and topological
optimizations, have been introduced to design metamaterials. However, none of
these algorithms are general enough to fulfill multi-objective tasks. Recently,
deep learning methods represented by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
have been applied to inverse design of metamaterials, which can directly
generate high-degree-of-freedom meta-atoms based on S-parameter requirements.
However, the adversarial training process of GANs makes the network unstable
and results in high modeling costs. This paper proposes a novel metamaterial
inverse design method based on the diffusion probability theory. By learning
the Markov process that transforms the original structure into a Gaussian
distribution, the proposed method can gradually remove the noise starting from
the Gaussian distribution and generate new high-degree-of-freedom meta-atoms
that meet S-parameter conditions, which avoids the model instability introduced
by the adversarial training process of GANs and ensures more accurate and
high-quality generation results. Experiments have proven that our method is
superior to representative methods of GANs in terms of model convergence speed,
generation accuracy, and quality.</p>

    <p>We report a series of deep learning models to solve complex forward and

transformer architectures, we demonstrate a flexible framework to capture
complex chemical structures. First trained on the QM9 dataset and a series of
quantum mechanical properties (e.g. homo, lumo, free energy, heat capacity,
etc.), we then generalize the model to study and design key properties of deep
eutectic solvents. In addition to separate forward and inverse models, we also
report an integrated fully prompt-based multi-task generative pretrained
transformer model that solves multiple forward, inverse design, and prediction
tasks, flexibly and within one model. We show that the multi-task generative
model has the overall best performance and allows for flexible integration of
multiple objectives, within one model, and for distinct chemistries, suggesting
that synergies emerge during training of this large language model. Trained
jointly in tasks related to the QM9 dataset and deep eutectic solvents (DESs),
the model can predict various quantum mechanical properties and critical
properties to achieve deep eutectic solvent behavior. Several novel

    <p>Optical multilayer thin film structures have been widely used in numerous

superconducting database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
generate new superconductors with a high success rate. We started with a DFT
dataset of $\approx$1000 superconducting materials to train the diffusion
model. We used the model to generate 3000 new structures, which along with
pre-trained ALIGNN screening results in 61 candidates. For the top candidates,
we performed DFT calculations for validation. Such approaches go beyond the
funnel-like materials design approaches and allow for the inverse design of
next-generation materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Designing molecules with desirable physiochemical properties and
functionalities is a long-standing challenge in chemistry, material science,
and drug discovery. Recently, machine learning-based generative models have
emerged as promising approaches for \emph{de novo} molecule design. However,
further refinement of methodology is highly desired as most existing methods
lack unified modeling of 2D topology and 3D geometry information and fail to
effectively learn the structure-property relationship for molecule design. Here
we present MolCode, a roto-translation equivariant generative framework for
\underline{Mol}ecular graph-structure \underline{Co-de}sign. In MolCode, 3D
geometric information empowers the molecular 2D graph generation, which in turn
helps guide the prediction of molecular 3D structure. Extensive experimental
results show that MolCode outperforms previous methods on a series of
challenging tasks including \emph{de novo} molecule design, targeted molecule
discovery, and structure-based drug design. Particularly, MolCode not only
consistently generates valid (99.95$\%$ Validity) and diverse (98.75$\%$
Uniqueness) molecular graphs/structures with desirable properties, but also
generate drug-like molecules with high affinity to target proteins (61.8$\%$
high-affinity ratio), which demonstrates MolCode's potential applications in
material design and drug discovery. Our extensive investigation reveals that
the 2D topology and 3D geometry contain intrinsically complementary information
in molecule design, and provide new insights into machine learning-based
molecule representation and generation.</p>

    <p>Quantum many-body physics simulation has important impacts on understanding
fundamental science and has applications to quantum materials design and
quantum technology. However, due to the exponentially growing size of the
Hilbert space with respect to the particle number, a direct simulation is
intractable. While representing quantum states with tensor networks and neural
networks are the two state-of-the-art methods for approximate simulations, each
has its own limitations in terms of expressivity and inductive bias. To address
these challenges, we develop a novel architecture, Autoregressive Neural
TensorNet (ANTN), which bridges tensor networks and autoregressive neural
networks. We show that Autoregressive Neural TensorNet parameterizes normalized
wavefunctions, allows for exact sampling, generalizes the expressivity of
tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks, and inherits a variety of
symmetries from autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate our approach on
quantum state learning as well as finding the ground state of the challenging
2D $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model with different systems sizes and coupling
parameters, outperforming both tensor networks and autoregressive neural
networks. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantum many-body physics
simulation, quantum technology design, and generative modeling in artificial

    <p>This paper demonstrates the learning of the underlying device physics by
mapping device structure images to their corresponding Current-Voltage (IV)
characteristics using a novel framework based on variational autoencoders
(VAE). Since VAE is used, domain expertise is not required and the framework
can be quickly deployed on any new device and measurement. This is expected to
be useful in the compact modeling of novel devices when only device
cross-sectional images and electrical characteristics are available (e.g. novel
emerging memory). Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) generated and
hand-drawn Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) device images and noisy
drain-current-gate-voltage curves (IDVG) are used for the demonstration. The
framework is formed by stacking two VAEs (one for image manifold learning and
one for IDVG manifold learning) which communicate with each other through the
latent variables. Five independent variables with different strengths are used.
It is shown that it can perform inverse design (generate a design structure for
a given IDVG) and forward prediction (predict IDVG for a given structure image,
which can be used for compact modeling if the image is treated as device
parameters) successfully. Since manifold learning is used, the machine is shown
to be robust against noise in the inputs (i.e. using hand-drawn images and
noisy IDVG curves) and not confused by weak and irrelevant independent
variables.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Modeling the full-range deformation behaviors of materials under complex
loading and materials conditions is a significant challenge for constitutive
relations (CRs) modeling. We propose a general encoder-decoder deep learning
framework that can model high-dimensional stress-strain data and complex
loading histories with robustness and universal capability. The framework
employs an encoder to project high-dimensional input information (e.g., loading
history, loading conditions, and materials information) to a lower-dimensional
hidden space and a decoder to map the hidden representation to the stress of
interest. We evaluated various encoder architectures, including gated recurrent
unit (GRU), GRU with attention, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the
Transformer encoder, on two complex stress-strain datasets that were designed
to include a wide range of complex loading histories and loading conditions.
All architectures achieved excellent test results with an RMSE below 1 MPa.
Additionally, we analyzed the capability of the different architectures to make
predictions on out-of-domain applications, with an uncertainty estimation based
on deep ensembles. The proposed approach provides a robust alternative to
empirical/semi-empirical models for CRs modeling, offering the potential for
more accurate and efficient materials design and optimization.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Functional materials that enable many technological applications in our
everyday lives owe their unique properties to defects that are carefully
engineered and incorporated into these materials during processing. However,
optimizing and characterizing these defects is very challenging in practice,
making computational modelling an indispensable complementary tool. We have
developed an automated workflow and code to accelerate these calculations
(AiiDA-defects), which utilises the AiiDA framework, a robust open-source
high-throughput materials informatics infrastructure that provides workflow
automation while simultaneously preserving and storing the full data provenance
in a relational database that is queryable and traversable. This paper
describes the design and implementation details of AiiDA-defects, the models
and algorithms used, and demonstrates its use in an application to fully
characterize the defect chemistry of the well known solid-state Li-ion
conductors LiZnPS 4 . We anticipate that AiiDA-defects will be useful as a tool
for fully automated and reproducible defect calculations, allowing detailed
defect chemistry to be obtained in a reliable and high-throughput way, and
paving the way toward the generation of defects databases for accelerated
materials design and discovery</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Next-generation integrated nanophotonic device designs leverage advanced
optimization techniques such as inverse design and topology optimization which
achieve high performance and extreme miniaturization by optimizing a massively
complex design space enabled by small feature sizes. However, unless the
optimization is heavily constrained, the generated small features are not
reliably fabricated, leading to optical performance degradation. Even for
simpler, conventional designs, fabrication-induced performance degradation
still occurs. The degree of deviation from the original design not only depends
on the size and shape of its features, but also on the distribution of features
and the surrounding environment, presenting complex, proximity-dependent
behavior. Without proprietary fabrication process specifications, design
corrections can only be made after calibrating fabrication runs take place. In
this work, we introduce a general deep machine learning model that
automatically corrects photonic device design layouts prior to first
fabrication. Only a small set of scanning electron microscopy images of
engineered training features are required to create the deep learning model.
With correction, the outcome of the fabricated layout is closer to what is
intended, and thus so too is the performance of the design. Without modifying
the nanofabrication process, adding significant computation in design, or
requiring proprietary process specifications, we believe our model opens the
door to new levels of reliability and performance in next-generation photonic
circuits.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The goal of most materials discovery is to discover materials that are
superior to those currently known. Fundamentally, this is close to
extrapolation, which is a weak point for most machine learning models that
learn the probability distribution of data. Herein, we develop reinforcement
learning-guided combinatorial chemistry, which is a rule-based molecular
designer driven by trained policy for selecting subsequent molecular fragments
to get a target molecule. Since our model has the potential to generate all
possible molecular structures that can be obtained from combinations of
molecular fragments, unknown molecules with superior properties can be
discovered. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that our model is more
suitable for discovering better compounds than probability
distribution-learning models. In an experiment aimed at discovering molecules
that hit seven extreme target properties, our model discovered 1,315 of all
target-hitting molecules and 7,629 of five target-hitting molecules out of
100,000 trials, whereas the probability distribution-learning models failed.
Moreover, it has been confirmed that every molecule generated under the binding
rules of molecular fragments is 100% chemically valid. To illustrate the
performance in actual problems, we also demonstrate that our models work well
on two practical applications: discovering protein docking molecules and HIV
inhibitors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Data is a critical element in any discovery process. In the last decades, we
observed exponential growth in the volume of available data and the technology
to manipulate it. However, data is only practical when one can structure it for
a well-defined task. For instance, we need a corpus of text broken into
sentences to train a natural language machine-learning model. In this work, we
will use the token \textit{dataset} to designate a structured set of data built
to perform a well-defined task. Moreover, the dataset will be used in most
cases as a blueprint of an entity that at any moment can be stored as a table.
Specifically, in science, each area has unique forms to organize, gather and
handle its datasets. We believe that datasets must be a first-class entity in
any knowledge-intensive process, and all workflows should have exceptional
attention to datasets' lifecycle, from their gathering to uses and evolution.
We advocate that science and engineering discovery processes are extreme
instances of the need for such organization on datasets, claiming for new
approaches and tooling. Furthermore, these requirements are more evident when
the discovery workflow uses artificial intelligence methods to empower the
subject-matter expert. In this work, we discuss an approach to bringing
datasets as a critical entity in the discovery process in science. We
illustrate some concepts using material discovery as a use case. We chose this
domain because it leverages many significant problems that can be generalized
to other science fields.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using the first-principles calculations and La3Te4 as an example of an n-type
gapped metal, we demonstrate that gapped metals can develop spontaneous defect
formation resulting in off-stoichiometric compounds. Importantly, these
compounds have different free carrier concentrations and can be realized by
optimizing synthesis conditions. The ability to manipulate the free carrier
concentration allows to tailor intraband and interband transitions, thus
controlling the optoelectronic properties of materials in general.
Specifically, by realizing different off-stochiometric La3-xTe4 compounds, it
is possible to reach specific crossings of the real part of the dielectric
function with the zero line, reduce plasma frequency contribution to absorption
spectra, or, more generally, induce metal-to-insulator transition. This is
particularly important in the context of optoelectronic, plasmonic, and
epsilon-near-zero materials, as it enables materials design with a target
functionality. While this work is limited to the specific gapped metal, we
demonstrate that the fundamental physics is transferable to other gapped metals
and can be generally used to design a wide class of new
optoelectronic/plasmonic materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This paper introduces WhereWulff, a semi-autonomous workflow for modeling the
reactivity of catalyst surfaces. The workflow begins with a bulk optimization
task that takes an initial bulk structure, and returns the optimized bulk
geometry and magnetic state, including stability under reaction conditions. The
stable bulk structure is the input to a surface chemistry task that enumerates
surfaces up to a user-specified maximum Miller index, computes relaxed surface
energies for those surfaces, and then prioritizes those for subsequent
adsorption energy calculations based on their contribution to the Wulff
construction shape. The workflow handles computational resource constraints
such as limited wall-time as well as automated job submission and analysis. We
illustrate the workflow for oxygen evolution (OER) intermediates on two double
perovskites. WhereWulff nearly halved the number of Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations from ~ 240 to ~ 132 by prioritizing terminations, up to a
maximum Miller index of 1, based on surface stability. Additionally, it
automatically handled the 180 additional re-submission jobs required to
successfully converge 120+ atoms systems under a 48-hour wall-time cluster
constraint. There are four main use cases that we envision for WhereWulff: (1)
as a first-principles source of truth to validate and update a closed-loop
self-sustaining materials discovery pipeline, (2) as a data generation tool,
(3) as an educational tool, allowing users (e.g. experimentalists) unfamiliar
with OER modeling to probe materials they might be interested in before doing
further in-domain analyses, (4) and finally as a starting point for users to
extend with reactions other than OER, as part of a collaborative software

    <p>Composite materials with 3D architectures are desirable in a variety of
applications for the capability of tailoring their properties to meet multiple
functional requirements. By the arrangement of materials' internal components,
structure design is of great significance in tuning the properties of the
composites. However, most of the composite structures are proposed by empirical
designs following existing patterns. Hindered by the complexity of 3D
structures, it is hard to extract customized structures with multiple desired
properties from large design space. Here we report a multi-objective driven
Wasserstein generative adversarial network (MDWGAN) to implement inverse
designs of 3D composite structures according to given geometrical, structural
and mechanical requirements. Our framework consists a GAN based network which
generates 3D composite structures possessing with similar geometrical and
structural features to the target dataset. Besides, multiple objectives are
introduced to our framework for the control of mechanical property and isotropy
of the composites. Real time calculation of the properties in training
iterations is achieved by an accurate surrogate model. We constructed a small
and concise dataset to illustrate our framework. With multiple objectives
combined by their weight, and the 3D-GAN act as a soft constraint, our
framework is proved to be capable of tuning the properties of the generated
composites in multiple aspects, while keeping the selected features of
different kinds of structures. The feasibility on small dataset and potential
scalability on objectives of other properties make our work a novel, effective
approach to provide fast, experience free composite structure designs for
various functional materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this paper, we introduce a denoising diffusion algorithm to discover
microstructures with nonlinear fine-tuned properties. Denoising diffusion
probabilistic models are generative models that use diffusion-based dynamics to
gradually denoise images and generate realistic synthetic samples. By learning
the reverse of a Markov diffusion process, we design an artificial intelligence
to efficiently manipulate the topology of microstructures to generate a massive
number of prototypes that exhibit constitutive responses sufficiently close to
designated nonlinear constitutive responses. To identify the subset of
microstructures with sufficiently precise fine-tuned properties, a
convolutional neural network surrogate is trained to replace high-fidelity
finite element simulations to filter out prototypes outside the admissible
range. The results of this study indicate that the denoising diffusion process
is capable of creating microstructures of fine-tuned nonlinear material
properties within the latent space of the training data. More importantly, the
resulting algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate additional
topological and geometric modifications by introducing high-dimensional
structures embedded in the latent space. The algorithm is tested on the
open-source mechanical MNIST data set. Consequently, this algorithm is not only
capable of performing inverse design of nonlinear effective media but also
learns the nonlinear structure-property map to quantitatively understand the
multiscale interplay among the geometry and topology and their effective
macroscopic properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Optimizing molecular design and discovering novel chemical structures to meet
certain objectives, such as quantitative estimates of the drug-likeness score
(QEDs), is NP-hard due to the vast combinatorial design space of discrete
molecular structures, which makes it near impossible to explore the entire
search space comprehensively to exploit de novo structures with properties of
interest. To address this challenge, reducing the intractable search space into
a lower-dimensional latent volume helps examine molecular candidates more
feasibly via inverse design. Autoencoders are suitable deep learning
techniques, equipped with an encoder that reduces the discrete molecular
structure into a latent space and a decoder that inverts the search space back
to the molecular design. The continuous property of the latent space, which
characterizes the discrete chemical structures, provides a flexible
representation for inverse design in order to discover novel molecules.
However, exploring this latent space requires certain insights to generate new
structures. We propose using a convex hall surrounding the top molecules in
terms of high QEDs to ensnare a tight subspace in the latent representation as
an efficient way to reveal novel molecules with high QEDs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our suggested method by using the QM9 as a training dataset
along with the Self- Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) representation to
calibrate the autoencoder in order to carry out the Inverse molecular design
that leads to unfold novel chemical structure.</p>

    <p>Understanding material composition-structure-function relationships is of
critical importance for the design and discovery of novel functional materials.
While most such studies focus on individual materials, we conducted a global
mapping study of all known materials deposited in the Material Project database
to investigate their distributions in the space of a set of seven
compositional, structural, physical, and neural latent descriptors. These
two-dimensional materials maps along with their density maps allow us to
illustrate the distribution of the patterns and clusters of different shapes,
which indicates the propensity of these materials and the tinkering history of
existing materials. We then overlap the material properties such as composition
prototypes and piezoelectric properties over the background materials maps to
study the relationships of how material compositions and structures affect
their physical properties. We also use these maps to study the spatial
distributions of properties of known inorganic materials, in particular those
of local vicinities in structural space such as structural density and
functional diversity. These maps provide a uniquely comprehensive overview of
materials and space and thus reveal previously undescribed fundamental
properties. Our methodology can be easily extended by other researchers to
generate their own global material maps with different background maps and
overlap properties for both distribution understanding and cluster-based new
material discovery. The source code for feature generation and generated maps

    <p>Structural search and feature extraction are a central subject in modern

prediction-analysis framework, which includes a symmetry-based combinatorial

to significantly reduce computational costs and to extract property-related
structural features. Our method is highly accurate and predictive, and extracts
structural features from desired structures to guide materials design. As a
case study, we apply our new approach to a two-dimensional B-C-N system, which
identifies 28 previously undiscovered stable structures out of 82 compositions;
our analysis further establishes the structural features that contribute most
to energy and bandgap. Compared to conventional approaches, SCCOP is about 10
times faster while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Our new framework is
generally applicable to all types of systems for precise and efficient
structural search, providing new insights into the relationship between
ML-extracted structural features and physical properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Tackling the most pressing problems for humanity, such as the climate crisis
and the threat of global pandemics, requires accelerating the pace of
scientific discovery. While science has traditionally relied on trial and error
and even serendipity to a large extent, the last few decades have seen a surge
of data-driven scientific discoveries. However, in order to truly leverage
large-scale data sets and high-throughput experimental setups, machine learning
methods will need to be further improved and better integrated in the
scientific discovery pipeline. A key challenge for current machine learning
methods in this context is the efficient exploration of very large search
spaces, which requires techniques for estimating reducible (epistemic)
uncertainty and generating sets of diverse and informative experiments to
perform. This motivated a new probabilistic machine learning framework called
GFlowNets, which can be applied in the modeling, hypotheses generation and
experimental design stages of the experimental science loop. GFlowNets learn to
sample from a distribution given indirectly by a reward function corresponding
to an unnormalized probability, which enables sampling diverse, high-reward
candidates. GFlowNets can also be used to form efficient and amortized Bayesian
posterior estimators for causal models conditioned on the already acquired
experimental data. Having such posterior models can then provide estimators of
epistemic uncertainty and information gain that can drive an experimental
design policy. Altogether, here we will argue that GFlowNets can become a
valuable tool for AI-driven scientific discovery, especially in scenarios of
very large candidate spaces where we have access to cheap but inaccurate
measurements or to expensive but accurate measurements. This is a common
setting in the context of drug and material discovery, which we use as examples
throughout the paper.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In recent times, transformer networks have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Here we
present a workflow based on the fine-tuning of BERT models for different
downstream tasks, which results in the automated extraction of structured
information from unstructured natural language in scientific literature.
Contrary to existing methods for the automated extraction of structured
compound-property relations from similar sources, our workflow does not rely on
the definition of intricate grammar rules. Hence, it can be adapted to a new
task without requiring extensive implementation efforts and knowledge. We test
our data-extraction workflow by automatically generating a database for Curie
temperatures and one for band gaps. These are then compared with
manually-curated datasets and with those obtained with a state-of-the-art
rule-based method. Furthermore, in order to showcase the practical utility of
the automatically extracted data in a material-design workflow, we employ them
to construct machine-learning models to predict Curie temperatures and band
gaps. In general we find that, although more noisy, automatically extracted
datasets can grow fast in volume and that such volume partially compensates for
the inaccuracy in downstream tasks.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This paper puts forward an integrated microstructure design methodology that
replaces the common existing design approaches: 1) reconstruction of
microstructures, 2) analyzing and quantifying material properties, and 3)
inverse design of materials using deep-learned generative and surrogate models.
The long-standing issue of microstructure reconstruction is well addressed in
this study using a new class of state-of-the-art generative model, the
diffusion-based generative model (DGM). Moreover, the conditional formulation
of DGM for guidance to the embedded desired material properties with a
transformer-based attention mechanism enables the inverse design of
multifunctional composites. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
surrogate model is utilized to analyze the nonlinear material behavior to
facilitate the prediction of material properties for building
microstructure-property linkages. Combined, these generative and surrogate
models enable large data processing and database construction that is often not
affordable with resource-intensive finite element method (FEM)-based direct
numerical simulation (DNS) and iterative reconstruction methods. An example
case is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
which is designing mechanoluminescence (ML) particulate composites made of
europium and dysprosium ions. The results show that the inversely-designed
multiple ML microstructure candidates with the proposed generative and
surrogate models meet the multiple design requirements (e.g., volume fraction,
elastic constant, and light sensitivity). The evaluation of the generated
samples' quality and the surrogate models' performance using appropriate
metrics are also included. This assessment demonstrates that the proposed
integrated methodology offers an end-to-end solution for practical material
design applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>While the capabilities of generative models heavily improved in different
domains (images, text, graphs, molecules, etc.), their evaluation metrics
largely remain based on simplified quantities or manual inspection with limited
practicality. To this end, we propose a framework for Multi-level Performance
Evaluation of Generative mOdels (MPEGO), which could be employed across
different domains. MPEGO aims to quantify generation performance
hierarchically, starting from a sub-feature-based low-level evaluation to a
global features-based high-level evaluation. MPEGO offers great customizability
as the employed features are entirely user-driven and can thus be highly
domain/problem-specific while being arbitrarily complex (e.g., outcomes of
experimental procedures). We validate MPEGO using multiple generative models
across several datasets from the material discovery domain. An ablation study
is conducted to study the plausibility of intermediate steps in MPEGO. Results
demonstrate that MPEGO provides a flexible, user-driven, and multi-level
evaluation framework, with practical insights on the generation quality. The
framework, source code, and experiments will be available at
https://github.com/GT4SD/mpego.</p>

implement a systematic optimization to meet certain design targets, and include

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have wide applications in superconductors,
quantum, and topological materials. However, their rational design is not well
established, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D
materials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density
functional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed
to discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a
generative material design pipeline, namely material transformer
generator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We
train two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural
language models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The
models are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions,
which are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction.
Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability
based on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new
DFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including
NiCl$_4$, IrSBr, CuBr$_3$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential
of our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D
materials and other functional materials.</p>

    <p>The design of new High Entropy Alloys that can achieve exceptional mechanical
properties is presently of great interest to the materials science community.
However, due to the difficulty of designing these alloys using traditional
methods, machine learning has recently emerged as an essential tool.
Particularly, the screening of candidate alloy compositions using surrogate
models has become a mainstay of materials design in recent years. Many of these
models use the atomic fractions of the alloying elements as inputs. However,
there are many possible representation schemes for encoding alloy compositions,
including both unstructured and structured variants. As the input features play
a critical role in determining surrogate model performance, we have
systematically compared these representation schemes on the basis of their
performance in single-task deep learning models and in transfer learning
scenarios. The results from these tests indicate that compared to the
unstructured and randomly ordered schemes, chemically meaningful arrangements
of elements within spatial representation schemes generally lead to better
models. However, we also observed that tree-based models using only the atomic
fractions as input were able to outperform these models in transfer learning.</p>

    <p>Anomalous Nernst effect generates a transverse voltage perpendicular to the
temperature gradient. It has several advantages compared with the longitudinal
thermoelectricity for energy conversion, such as decoupling of electronic and
thermal transports, higher flexibility, and simpler lateral structure. However,
a design principle beyond specific materials systems for obtaining a large
anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is still absent. In this work, we
theoretically demonstrate that a pair of Dirac nodes under a Zeeman field
manifests a double-peak anomalous Hall conductivity curve with respect to the
chemical potential and a compensated carriers feature, leading to an enhanced
ANC pinning at the Fermi level compared with that of a simple Weyl semimetal
with two Weyl nodes. Based on first-principles calculations, we then provide
two Dirac semimetal candidates, i.e., Na3Bi and NaTeAu, and show that under a
Zeeman field they exhibit a sizable ANC value of 0.4 A/(m*K) and 1.3 A/(m*K),
respectively, near the Fermi level. Our work provides a design principle with a
prototype band structure for enhanced ANC pinning at Fermi level, shedding
light on the inverse design of other specific functional materials base on
electronic structure.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving
inverse problems where the objective is to find the (multiple)
microarchitectures that give rise to a given set of properties. The limited
resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such
inverse problems for specific sizes. One should, therefore, find multiple
microarchitectural designs that exhibit the desired properties for a specimen
with given dimensions. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be
resistant to fatigue and fracture, meaning that peak stresses should be
minimized as well. Such a multi-objective inverse design problem is formidably
difficult to solve but its solution is the key to real-world applications of
mechanical metamaterials. Here, we propose a modular approach titled
'Deep-DRAM' that combines four decoupled models, including two deep learning
models (DLM), a deep generative model (DGM) based on conditional variational
autoencoders (CVAE), and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep-DRAM
(deep learning for the design of random-network metamaterials) integrates these
models into a unified framework capable of finding many solutions to the
multi-objective inverse design problem posed here. The integrated framework
first introduces the desired elastic properties to the DGM, which returns a set
of candidate designs. The candidate designs, together with the target specimen
dimensions are then passed to the DLM which predicts their actual elastic
properties considering the specimen size. After a filtering step based on the
closeness of the actual properties to the desired ones, the last step uses
direct FE simulations to identify the designs with the minimum peak stresses.</p>

    <p>The discovery of novel materials drives industrial innovation, although the
pace of discovery tends to be slow due to the infrequency of "Eureka!" moments.
These moments are typically tangential to the original target of the
experimental work: "accidental discoveries". Here we demonstrate the
acceleration of intentional materials discovery - targeting material properties
of interest while generalizing the search to a large materials space with
machine learning (ML) methods. We demonstrate a closed-loop ML discovery
process targeting novel superconducting materials, which have industrial
applications ranging from quantum computing to sensors to power delivery. By
closing the loop, i.e. by experimentally testing the results of the
ML-generated superconductivity predictions and feeding data back into the ML
model to refine, we demonstrate that success rates for superconductor discovery
can be more than doubled. In four closed-loop cycles, we discovered a new
superconductor in the Zr-In-Ni system, re-discovered five superconductors
unknown in the training datasets, and identified two additional phase diagrams
of interest for new superconducting materials. Our work demonstrates the
critical role experimental feedback provides in ML-driven discovery, and
provides definite evidence that such technologies can accelerate discovery even
in the absence of knowledge of the underlying physics.</p>

    <p>Graphene quantum dots provide a platform for manipulating electron behaviors
in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials. Most previous works were of the
"forward" type in that the objective was to solve various confinement,
transport and scattering problems with given structures that can be generated
by, e.g., applying an external electrical field. There are applications such as
cloaking or superscattering where the challenging problem of inverse design
needs to be solved: finding a quantum-dot structure according to certain
desired functional characteristics. A brute-force search of the system
configuration based directly on the solutions of the Dirac equation is
computational infeasible. We articulate a machine-learning approach to
addressing the inverse-design problem where artificial neural networks subject
to physical constraints are exploited to replace the rigorous Dirac equation
solver. In particular, we focus on the problem of designing a quantum dot
structure to generate both cloaking and superscattering in terms of the
scattering efficiency as a function of the energy. We construct a physical loss
function that enables accurate prediction of the scattering characteristics. We
demonstrate that, in the regime of Klein tunneling, the scattering efficiency
can be designed to vary over two orders of magnitudes, allowing any scattering
curve to be generated from a proper combination of the gate potentials. Our
physics-based machine-learning approach can be a powerful design tool for 2D
Dirac material-based electronics.</p>

    <p>One key challenge in the field of topological superconductivity (Tsc) has
been the rareness of material realization. This is true not only for the
first-order Tsc featuring Majorana surface modes, but also for the higher-order
Tsc, which host Majorana hinge and corner modes. Here, we propose a four-step
strategy that mathematically derives comprehensive guiding principles for the
search and design for materials of general higher-order Tsc phases.
Specifically, such recipes consist of conditions on the normal state and
pairing symmetry that can lead to a given higher-order Tsc state. We
demonstrate this strategy by obtaining recipes for achieving three-dimensional
higher-order Tsc phases protected by the inversion symmetry. Following our
recipe, we predict that the observed superconductivity in centrosymmetric
MoTe$_2$ is a candidate for higher-order Tsc with corner modes. Our proposed
strategy enables systematic materials search and design for higher-order Tsc,
which can mobilize the experimental efforts and accelerate the material

    <p>Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest health problem, especially in
the current period of COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the unique membrane-destruction
bactericidal mechanism, antimicrobial peptide-mimetic copolymers are paid more
attention and it is urgent to find more potential candidates with
broad-spectrum antibacterial efficacy and low toxicity. Artificial intelligence
has shown significant performance on small molecule or biotech drugs, however,
the higher-dimension of polymer space and the limited experimental data
restrict the application of existing methods on copolymer design. Herein, we
develop a universal random copolymer inverse design system via multi-model
copolymer representation learning, knowledge distillation and reinforcement
learning. Our system realize a high-precision antimicrobial activity prediction
with few-shot data by extracting various chemical information from multi-modal
copolymer representations. By pre-training a scaffold-decorator generative
model via knowledge distillation, copolymer space are greatly contracted to the
near space of existing data for exploration. Thus, our reinforcement learning
algorithm can be adaptive for customized generation on specific scaffolds and
requirements on property or structures. We apply our system on collected
antimicrobial peptide-mimetic copolymers data, and we discover candidate
copolymers with desired properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>For conceptual design, engineers rely on conventional iterative (often
manual) techniques. Emerging parametric models facilitate design space
exploration based on quantifiable performance metrics, yet remain
time-consuming and computationally expensive. Pure optimisation methods,
however, ignore qualitative aspects (e.g. aesthetics or construction methods).
This paper provides a performance-driven design exploration framework to
augment the human designer through a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
(CVAE), which serves as forward performance predictor for given design features
as well as an inverse design feature predictor conditioned on a set of
performance requests. The CVAE is trained on 18'000 synthetically generated
instances of a pedestrian bridge in Switzerland. Sensitivity analysis is
employed for explainability and informing designers about (i) relations of the
model between features and/or performances and (ii) structural improvements
under user-defined objectives. A case study proved our framework's potential to
serve as a future co-pilot for conceptual design studies of pedestrian bridges
and beyond.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>To achieve thermoelectric energy conversion, a large transverse
thermoelectric effect in topological materials is crucial. However, the general
relationship between topological electronic structures and transverse
thermoelectric effect remains unclear, restricting the rational design of novel
transverse thermoelectric materials. Herein, we demonstrate a topological
transition-induced giant transverse thermoelectric effect in polycrystalline
Mn-doped Mg3+{\delta}Bi2 material, which has a competitively large transverse
thermopower (617 uV/K), power factor (20393 uWm-1K-2), magnetoresistance
(16600%), and electronic mobility (35280cm2V-1S-1). The high performance is
triggered by the modulation of chemical pressure and disorder effects in the
presence of Mn doping, which induces the transition from a topological
insulator to a Dirac semimetal. The high-performance polycrystalline Mn-doped
Mg3+{\delta} Bi2 described in this work robustly boosts transverse
thermoelectric effect through topological phase transition, paving a new avenue
for the material design of transverse thermoelectricity.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The past decade has witnessed the advances of artificial intelligence with
various applications in engineering. Recently, artificial neural network
empowered inverse design for metasurfaces has been developed that can design
on-demand meta-atoms with diverse shapes and high performance, where the design
process based on artificial intelligence is fast and automatic. However, once
the inverse-designed static meta-atom is fabricated, the function of the
metasurface is fixed. Reconfigurable metasurfaces can realize dynamic
functions, while applying artificial intelligence to design practical
reconfigurable meta-atoms inversely has not been reported yet. Here, we present
a deep-learning-empowered inverse design method for freeform reconfigurable
metasurfaces, which can generate on-demand reconfigurable coding meta-atoms at
self-defined frequency bands. To reduce the scale of dataset, a decoupling
method of the reconfigurable meta-atom based on microwave network theory is
proposed at first, which can convert the inverse design process for
reconfigurable coding meta-atoms to the inverse design for static structures. A
convolutional neural network model is trained to predict the responses of
free-shaped meta-atoms, and the genetic algorithm is applied to generate the
optimal structure patterns rapidly. As a demonstration of concept, several
inverse-designed examples are generated with different self-defined spectrum
responses in microwave band, and an inverse-designed wideband reconfigurable
metasurface prototype is fabricated and measured for beam scanning applications
with broad bandwidth. Our work paves the way for the fast and automatic design
process of high-performance reconfigurable metasurfaces.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The high demand for fabricating microresonators with desired optical
properties has led to various techniques to optimize geometries, mode
structures, nonlinearities and dispersion. Depending on applications, the
dispersion in such resonators counters their optical nonlinearities and
influences the intracavity optical dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate the
use of a machine learning (ML) algorithm as a tool to determine the geometry of
microresonators from their dispersion profiles. The training dataset with ~460
samples is generated by finite element simulations and the model is
experimentally verified using integrated silicon nitride microresonators. Two
ML algorithms are compared along with suitable hyperparameter tuning, out of
which Random Forest (RF) yields the best results. The average error on the
simulated data is well below 15%.</p>

    <p>This chapter illustrates the use of defect physics as a conceptual and
theoretical framework for understanding and designing battery materials. It
starts with a methodology for first-principles studies of defects in complex
transition-metal oxides. The chapter then considers defects that are activated
in a cathode material during synthesis, during measurements, and during battery
use. Through these cases, it discusses possible defect landscapes in the
material and their implications, guidelines for materials design via
defect-controlled synthesis, mechanisms for electronic and ionic conduction and
for electrochemical extraction and (re-)insertion, and effects of doping.
Although specific examples are taken from studies of battery cathode materials,
the computational approach and discussions are general and applicable to any
ionic, electronic, or mixed ionic-electronic conducting materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>There is an increasing need in our society to achieve faster advances in
Science to tackle urgent problems, such as climate changes, environmental
hazards, sustainable energy systems, pandemics, among others. In certain
domains like chemistry, scientific discovery carries the extra burden of
assessing risks of the proposed novel solutions before moving to the
experimental stage. Despite several recent advances in Machine Learning and AI
to address some of these challenges, there is still a gap in technologies to
support end-to-end discovery applications, integrating the myriad of available
technologies into a coherent, orchestrated, yet flexible discovery process.
Such applications need to handle complex knowledge management at scale,
enabling knowledge consumption and production in a timely and efficient way for
subject matter experts (SMEs). Furthermore, the discovery of novel functional
materials strongly relies on the development of exploration strategies in the
chemical space. For instance, generative models have gained attention within
the scientific community due to their ability to generate enormous volumes of
novel molecules across material domains. These models exhibit extreme
creativity that often translates in low viability of the generated candidates.
In this work, we propose a workbench framework that aims at enabling the
human-AI co-creation to reduce the time until the first discovery and the
opportunity costs involved. This framework relies on a knowledge base with
domain and process knowledge, and user-interaction components to acquire
knowledge and advise the SMEs. Currently,the framework supports four main
activities: generative modeling, dataset triage, molecule adjudication, and
risk assessment.</p>

    <p>The evaluation of synthetic micro-structure images is an emerging problem as
machine learning and materials science research have evolved together. Typical
state of the art methods in evaluating synthetic images from generative models
have relied on the Fr\'echet Inception Distance. However, this and other

features that characterize physically accurate micro-structures and limited
dataset sizes. In this study we evaluate a variety of methods on scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images of graphene-reinforced polyurethane foams. The
primary objective of this paper is to report our findings with regards to the
shortcomings of existing methods so as to encourage the machine learning
community to consider enhancements in metrics for assessing quality of
synthetic images in the material science domain.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In the process of finding high-performance organic semiconductors (OSCs), it
is of paramount importance in material development to identify important
functional units that play key roles in material performance and subsequently
establish substructure-property relationships. Herein, we describe a
polymer-unit fingerprint (PUFp) generation framework. Machine learning (ML)
models can be used to determine structure-mobility relationships by using PUFp
information as structural input with 678 pieces of collected OSC data. A
polymer-unit library consisting of 445 units is constructed, and the key
polymer units for the mobility of OSCs are identified. By investigating the
combinations of polymer units with mobility performance, a scheme for designing
polymer OSC materials by combining ML approaches and PUFp information is
proposed to not only passively predict OSC mobility but also actively provide
structural guidance for new high-mobility OSC material design. The proposed
scheme demonstrates the ability to screen new materials through pre-evaluation
and classification ML steps and is an alternative methodology for applying ML
in new high-mobility OSC discovery.</p>

    <p>We study the problem of generating diverse candidates in the context of
Multi-Objective Optimization. In many applications of machine learning such as
drug discovery and material design, the goal is to generate candidates which
simultaneously optimize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. Moreover,
these objectives are often imperfect evaluations of some underlying property of
interest, making it important to generate diverse candidates to have multiple
options for expensive downstream evaluations. We propose Multi-Objective
GFlowNets (MOGFNs), a novel method for generating diverse Pareto optimal
solutions, based on GFlowNets. We introduce two variants of MOGFNs: MOGFN-PC,
which models a family of independent sub-problems defined by a scalarization
function, with reward-conditional GFlowNets, and MOGFN-AL, which solves a
sequence of sub-problems defined by an acquisition function in an active
learning loop. Our experiments on wide variety of synthetic and benchmark tasks
demonstrate advantages of the proposed methods in terms of the Pareto
performance and importantly, improved candidate diversity, which is the main

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The high-dimesionality, non-linearity and emergent properties of complex
systems pose a challenge to identifying general laws in the same manner that
has been so successful in simpler physical systems. In Anderson's seminal work
on why "more is different" he pointed to how emergent, macroscale patterns
break symmetries of the underlying microscale laws. Yet, less recognized is
that these large-scale, emergent patterns must also retain some symmetries of
the microscale rules. Here we introduce a new, relational macrostate theory
(RMT) that defines macrostates in terms of symmetries between two mutually
predictive observations, and develop a machine learning architecture, MacroNet,
that identifies macrostates. Using this framework, we show how macrostates can
be identifed across systems ranging in complexity from the simplicity of the
simple harmonic oscillator to the much more complex spatial patterning
characteristic of Turing instabilities. Furthermore, we show how our framework
can be used for the inverse design of microstates consistent with a given
macroscopic property -- in Turing patterns this allows us to design underlying
rule with a given specification of spatial patterning, and to identify which
rule parameters most control these patterns. By demonstrating a general theory
for how macroscopic properties emerge from conservation of symmetries in the
mapping between observations, we provide a machine learning framework that
allows a unified approach to identifying macrostates in systems from the simple
to complex, and allows the design of new examples consistent with a given
macroscopic property.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The task of designing optical multilayer thin-films regarding a given target
is currently solved using gradient-based optimization in conjunction with
methods that can introduce additional thin-film layers. Recently, Deep Learning
and Reinforcement Learning have been been introduced to the task of designing
thin-films with great success, however a trained network is usually only able
to become proficient for a single target and must be retrained if the optical
targets are varied. In this work, we apply conditional Invertible Neural
Networks (cINN) to inversely designing multilayer thin-films given an optical
target. Since the cINN learns the energy landscape of all thin-film
configurations within the training dataset, we show that cINNs can generate a
stochastic ensemble of proposals for thin-film configurations that that are
reasonably close to the desired target depending only on random variables. By
refining the proposed configurations further by a local optimization, we show
that the generated thin-films reach the target with significantly greater
precision than comparable state-of-the art approaches. Furthermore, we tested
the generative capabilities on samples which are outside the training data
distribution and found that the cINN was able to predict thin-films for
out-of-distribution targets, too. The results suggest that in order to improve
the generative design of thin-films, it is instructive to use established and
new machine learning methods in conjunction in order to obtain the most
favorable results.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We develop an open-source python workflow package, $py$GWBSE to perform
automated first-principles calculations within the GW-BSE (Bethe-Salpeter)
framework. GW-BSE is a many body perturbation theory based approach to explore
the quasiparticle (QP) and excitonic properties of materials. The GW
approximation has proven to be effective in accurately predicting bandgaps of a
wide range of materials by overcoming the bandgap underestimation issues of the
more widely used density functional theory (DFT). The BSE formalism, in spite
of being computationally expensive, produces absorption spectra directly
comparable with experimental observations. The $py$GWBSE package achieves
complete automation of the entire multi-step GW-BSE computation, including the
convergence tests of several parameters that are crucial for the accuracy of
these calculations. $py$GWBSE is integrated with $Wannier90$, a program for
calculating maximally-localized wannier functions, allowing the generation of
QP bandstructures. $py$GWBSE also enables automated creation of databases of
metadata and data, including QP and excitonic properties, which can be
extremely useful for future material discovery studies in the field of
ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors, electronics, photovoltaics, and
photocatalysis.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow multi-elemental oxides (MEO) is
generally challenging, partly due to difficulty in stoichiometry control.
Occasionally, if one of the elements is volatile at the growth temperature,
stoichiometry control can be greatly simplified using adsorption-controlled
growth mode. Otherwise, stoichiometry control remains one of the main hurdles
to achieving high quality MEO film growths. Here, we report another kind of
self-limited growth mode, dubbed diffusion-assisted epitaxy, in which excess
species diffuses into the substrate and leads to the desired stoichiometry, in
a manner similar to the conventional adsorption-controlled epitaxy.
Specifically, we demonstrate that using diffusion-assisted epitaxy,
high-quality epitaxial CuCrO$_2$ films can be grown over a wide growth window
without precise flux control using MBE.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>From higher computational efficiency to enabling the discovery of novel and
complex structures, deep learning has emerged as a powerful framework for the
design and optimization of nanophotonic circuits and components. However, both
data-driven and exploration-based machine learning strategies have limitations
in their effectiveness for nanophotonic inverse design. Supervised machine
learning approaches require large quantities of training data to produce
high-performance models and have difficulty generalizing beyond training data
given the complexity of the design space. Unsupervised and reinforcement
learning-based approaches on the other hand can have very lengthy training or
optimization times associated with them. Here we demonstrate a hybrid
supervised learning and reinforcement learning approach to the inverse design
of nanophotonic structures and show this approach can reduce training data
dependence, improve the generalizability of model predictions, and shorten
exploratory training times by orders of magnitude. The presented strategy thus
addresses a number of contemporary deep learning-based challenges, while
opening the door for new design methodologies that leverage multiple classes of
machine learning algorithms to produce more effective and practical solutions
for photonic design.</p>

    <p>Biofilms pose significant problems for engineers in diverse fields, such as
marine science, bioenergy, and biomedicine, where effective biofilm control is
a long-term goal. The adhesion and surface mechanics of biofilms play crucial
roles in generating and removing biofilm. Designing customized nano-surfaces
with different surface topologies can alter the adhesive properties to remove
biofilms more easily and greatly improve long-term biofilm control. To rapidly
design such topologies, we employ individual-based modeling and Bayesian
optimization to automate the design process and generate different active
surfaces for effective biofilm removal. Our framework successfully generated
ideal nano-surfaces for biofilm removal through applied shear and vibration.
Densely distributed short pillar topography is the optimal geometry to prevent
biofilm formation. Under fluidic shearing, the optimal topography is to
sparsely distribute tall, slim, pillar-like structures. When subjected to
either vertical or lateral vibrations, thick trapezoidal cones are found to be
optimal. Optimizing the vibrational loading indicates a small vibration
magnitude with relatively low frequencies is more efficient in removing
biofilm. Our results provide insights into various engineering fields that
require surface-mediated biofilm control. Our framework can also be applied to
more general materials design and optimization.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Inverse design, the process of matching a device or process parameters to
exhibit a desired performance, is applied in many disciplines ranging from
material design over chemical processes and to engineering. Machine learning
has emerged as a promising approach to overcome current limitations imposed by
the dimensionality of the parameter space and multimodal parameter
distributions. Most traditional optimization routines assume an invertible
one-to-one mapping between the design parameters and the target performance.
However, comparable or even identical performance may be realized by different
designs, yielding a multimodal distribution of possible solutions to the
inverse design problem which confuses the optimization algorithm. Here, we show
how a generative modeling approach based on invertible neural networks can
provide the full distribution of possible solutions to the inverse design
problem and resolve the ambiguity of nanodevice inverse design problems
featuring multimodal distributions. We implement a Conditional Invertible
Neural Network (cINN) and apply it to a proof-of-principle nanophotonic
problem, consisting in tailoring the transmission spectrum of a metallic film
milled by subwavelength indentations. We compare our approach with the commonly
used conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) framework and show the superior
flexibility and accuracy of the proposed cINNs when dealing with multimodal
device distributions. Our work shows that invertible neural networks provide a
valuable and versatile toolkit for advancing inverse design in nanoscience and
nanotechnology.</p>

    <p>AI systems can create, propagate, support, and automate bias in
decision-making processes. To mitigate biased decisions, we both need to
understand the origin of the bias and define what it means for an algorithm to
make fair decisions. Most group fairness notions assess a model's equality of
outcome by computing statistical metrics on the outputs. We argue that these
output metrics encounter intrinsic obstacles and present a complementary
approach that aligns with the increasing focus on equality of treatment. By
Locating Unfairness through Canonical Inverse Design (LUCID), we generate a
canonical set that shows the desired inputs for a model given a preferred
output. The canonical set reveals the model's internal logic and exposes
potential unethical biases by repeatedly interrogating the decision-making
process. We evaluate LUCID on the UCI Adult and COMPAS data sets and find that
some biases detected by a canonical set differ from those of output metrics.
The results show that by shifting the focus towards equality of treatment and
looking into the algorithm's internal workings, the canonical sets are a
valuable addition to the toolbox of algorithmic fairness evaluation.</p>

    <p>Catalyst discovery is paramount to support access to energy and key chemical
feedstocks in a post fossil fuel era. Exhaustive computational searches of
large material design spaces using ab-initio methods like density functional
theory (DFT) are infeasible. We seek to explore large design spaces at
relatively low computational cost by leveraging large, generalized, graph-based
machine learning (ML) models, which are pretrained and therefore require no
upfront data collection or training. We present catlas, a framework that
distributes and automates the generation of adsorbate-surface configurations
and ML inference of DFT energies to achieve this goal. Catlas is open source,
making ML assisted catalyst screenings easy and available to all. To
demonstrate its efficacy, we use catlas to explore catalyst candidates for the
direct conversion of syngas to multi-carbon oxygenates. For this case study, we
explore 947 stable/ metastable binary, transition metal intermetallics as
possible catalyst candidates. On this subset of materials, we are able to
predict the adsorption energy of key descriptors, *CO and *OH, with near-DFT
accuracy (0.16, 0.14 eV MAE, respectively). Using the projected selectivity
towards C2+ oxygenates from an existing microkinetic model, we identified 144
candidate materials. For 10 promising candidates, DFT calculations reveal a
good correlation with our assessment using ML. Among the top elemental
combinations were Pt-Ti, Pd-V, Ni-Nb, and Ti-Zn, all of which appear unexplored
experimentally.</p>

    <p>Sampling the phase space of molecular systems -- and, more generally, of
complex systems effectively modeled by stochastic differential equations -- is
a crucial modeling step in many fields, from protein folding to materials
discovery. These problems are often multiscale in nature: they can be described
in terms of low-dimensional effective free energy surfaces parametrized by a
small number of "slow" reaction coordinates; the remaining "fast" degrees of
freedom populate an equilibrium measure on the reaction coordinate values.
Sampling procedures for such problems are used to estimate effective free
energy differences as well as ensemble averages with respect to the conditional
equilibrium distributions; these latter averages lead to closures for effective
reduced dynamic models. Over the years, enhanced sampling techniques coupled
with molecular simulation have been developed. An intriguing analogy arises
with the field of Machine Learning (ML), where Generative Adversarial Networks
can produce high dimensional samples from low dimensional probability
distributions. This sample generation returns plausible high dimensional space
realizations of a model state, from information about its low-dimensional
representation. In this work, we present an approach that couples physics-based
simulations and biasing methods for sampling conditional distributions with
ML-based conditional generative adversarial networks for the same task. The
"coarse descriptors" on which we condition the fine scale realizations can
either be known a priori, or learned through nonlinear dimensionality
reduction. We suggest that this may bring out the best features of both
approaches: we demonstrate that a framework that couples cGANs with
physics-based enhanced sampling techniques can improve multiscale SDE dynamical
systems sampling, and even shows promise for systems of increasing complexity.</p>

    <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful computational method used to
obtain physical and chemical properties of materials. In the materials
discovery framework, it is often necessary to virtually screen a large and
high-dimensional chemical space to find materials with desired properties.
However, grid searching a large chemical space with DFT is inefficient due to
its high computational cost. We propose an approach utilizing Bayesian
optimization (BO) with an artificial neural network kernel to enable smart
search. This method leverages the BO algorithm, where the neural network,
trained on a limited number of DFT results, determines the most promising
regions of the chemical space to explore in subsequent iterations. This
approach aims to discover materials with target properties while minimizing the
number of DFT calculations required. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method, we investigated 63 doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with sizes
ranging from 1 to 2 nm to find the structure with the highest light absorbance.
Using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) only 12 times, we achieved a significant
reduction in computational cost, approximately 20% of what would be required
for a full grid search, by employing the BO algorithm with a neural network
kernel. Considering that TDDFT calculations for a single GQD require about half
a day of wall time on high-performance computing nodes, this reduction is
substantial. Our approach can be generalized to the discovery of new drugs,
chemicals, crystals, and alloys with high-dimensional and large chemical
spaces, offering a scalable solution for various applications in materials
science.</p>

    <p>Inverse design of short single-stranded RNA and DNA sequences (aptamers) is
the task of finding sequences that satisfy a set of desired criteria. Relevant
criteria may be, for example, the presence of specific folding motifs, binding
to molecular ligands, sensing properties, etc. Most practical approaches to
aptamer design identify a small set of promising candidate sequences using
high-throughput experiments (e.g. SELEX), and then optimize performance by
introducing only minor modifications to the empirically found candidates.
Sequences that possess the desired properties but differ drastically in
chemical composition will add diversity to the search space and facilitate the
discovery of useful nucleic acid aptamers. Systematic diversification protocols
are needed. Here we propose to use an unsupervised machine learning model known
as the Potts model to discover new, useful sequences with controllable sequence
diversity. We start by training a Potts model using the maximum entropy
principle on a small set of empirically identified sequences unified by a
common feature. To generate new candidate sequences with a controllable degree
of diversity, we take advantage of the model's spectral feature: an energy
bandgap separating sequences that are similar to the training set from those
that are distinct. By controlling the Potts energy range that is sampled, we
generate sequences that are distinct from the training set yet still likely to
have the encoded features. To demonstrate performance, we apply our approach to
design diverse pools of sequences with specified secondary structure motifs in
30-mer RNA and DNA aptamers.</p>

    <p>A central aim of materials discovery is an accurate and numerically reliable
description of thermodynamic properties, such as the enthalpies of formation

appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA)
balances numerical stability with high general accuracy. To assess the
r$^2$SCAN description of solid-state thermodynamics, we evaluate the formation
and decomposition enthalpies, equilibrium volumes, and fundamental bandgaps of
more than 1,000 solids using r$^2$SCAN, SCAN, and PBE, as well as two
dispersion-corrected variants, SCAN+rVV10 and r$^2$SCAN+rVV10. We show that
r$^2$SCAN achieves accuracy comparable to SCAN and often improves upon SCAN's
already excellent accuracy. Whereas SCAN+rVV10 is often observed to worsen the
formation enthalpies of SCAN, and makes no substantial correction to SCAN's
cell volume predictions, r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 predicts marginally less-accurate
formation enthalpies than r$^2$SCAN, and slightly more-accurate cell volumes
than r$^2$SCAN. The average absolute errors in predicted formation enthalpies
are found to decrease by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 from the GGA level to the
meta-GGA level. Smaller decreases in error are observed for decomposition
enthalpies. For formation enthalpies r$^2$SCAN improves over SCAN for
intermetallic systems. For a few classes of systems -- transition metals,
intermetallics, weakly-bound solids, and enthalpies of decomposition into
compounds -- GGAs are comparable to meta-GGAs. In total, r$^2$SCAN and

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Data-driven machine learning methods have the potential to dramatically
accelerate the rate of materials design over conventional human-guided
approaches. These methods would help identify or, in the case of generative
models, even create novel crystal structures of materials with a set of
specified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the
laboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in
developing suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the
machine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations
used in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations
that are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while
remaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing
challenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking
existing non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and
developing an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through
gradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be
coupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials
within the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian
space. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach
using atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional
variational autoencoders as the generative model. We are able to successfully
generate novel and valid atomic structures of sub-nanometer Pt nanoparticles as
a proof of concept. Furthermore, this method can be readily extended to any
suitable structural representation, thereby providing a powerful, generalizable
framework towards structure-based generation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Liquid metals (LM) are embedded in an elastomer matrix to obtain soft
composites with unique thermal, dielectric, and mechanical properties. They
have applications in soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and wearable
electronics. By linking the structure to the properties of these materials, it
is possible to perform material design rationally. Liquid-metal embedded
elastomers (LMEEs) have been designed for targeted electro-thermo-mechanical
properties by semi-supervised learning of structure-property (SP) links in a
variational autoencoder network (VAE). The design parameters are the
microstructural descriptors that are physically meaningful and have affine
relationships with the synthetization of the studied particulate composite. The
machine learning (ML) model is trained on a generated dataset of
microstructural descriptors with their multifunctional property quantities as
their labels. Sobol sequence is used for in-silico Design of Experiment (DoE)
by sampling the design space to generate a comprehensive dataset of 3D
microstructure realizations via a packing algorithm. The mechanical responses
of the generated microstructures are simulated using a previously developed
Finite Element (FE) model, considering the surface tension induced by LM
inclusions, while the linear thermal and dielectric constants are homogenized
with the help of our in-house Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) package. Following
the training by minimization of an appropriate loss function, the VAE encoder
acts as the surrogate of numerical solvers of the multifunctional
homogenizations, and its decoder is used for the material design. Our results
indicate the satisfactory performance of the surrogate model and the inverse
calculator with respect to high-fidelity numerical simulations validated with
LMEE experimental results.</p>

the ideal case) compared to ~1100V designed with human domain expertise.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Deep learning surrogate models have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs). Among them, the Fourier neural operator (FNO)
achieves good accuracy, and is significantly faster compared to numerical
solvers, on a variety of PDEs, such as fluid flows. However, the FNO uses the
Fast Fourier transform (FFT), which is limited to rectangular domains with
uniform grids. In this work, we propose a new framework, viz., geo-FNO, to
solve PDEs on arbitrary geometries. Geo-FNO learns to deform the input
(physical) domain, which may be irregular, into a latent space with a uniform
grid. The FNO model with the FFT is applied in the latent space. The resulting
geo-FNO model has both the computation efficiency of FFT and the flexibility of
handling arbitrary geometries. Our geo-FNO is also flexible in terms of its
input formats, viz., point clouds, meshes, and design parameters are all valid
inputs. We consider a variety of PDEs such as the Elasticity, Plasticity,
Euler's, and Navier-Stokes equations, and both forward modeling and inverse
design problems. Geo-FNO is $10^5$ times faster than the standard numerical
solvers and twice more accurate compared to direct interpolation on existing
ML-based PDE solvers such as the standard FNO.</p>

    <p>The generation of molecules with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to
revolutionize materials discovery. Potential applications range from
development of potent drugs to efficient carbon capture and separation
technologies. However, existing computational frameworks lack automated
training data creation and physical performance validation at meso-scale where
complex properties of amorphous materials emerge. The methodological gaps have
so far limited AI design to small-molecule applications. Here, we report the
first automated discovery of complex materials through inverse molecular design
which is informed by meso-scale target features and process figures-of-merit.
We have entered the new discovery regime by computationally generating and
validating hundreds of polymer candidates designed for application in
post-combustion carbon dioxide filtration. Specifically, we have validated each
discovery step, from training dataset creation, via graph-based generative
design of optimized monomer units, to molecular dynamics simulation of gas
permeation through the polymer membranes. For the latter, we have devised a
Representative Elementary Volume (REV) enabling permeability simulations at
about 1,000x the volume of an individual, AI-generated monomer, obtaining
quantitative agreement. The discovery-to-validation time per polymer candidate
is on the order of 100 hours in a standard computing environment, offering a
computational screening alternative prior to lab validation.</p>

    <p>Pre-trained transformer language models on large unlabeled corpus have
produced state-of-the-art results in natural language processing, organic
molecule design, and protein sequence generation. However, no such models have
been applied to learn the composition patterns of inorganic materials. Here we
train a series of seven modern transformer language models (GPT, GPT-2,
GPT-Neo, GPT-J, BLMM, BART, and RoBERTa) using the expanded formulas from
material deposited in the ICSD, OQMD, and Materials Projects databases. Six
different datasets with/out non-charge-neutral or balanced electronegativity
samples are used to benchmark the performances and uncover the generation
biases of modern transformer models for the generative design of materials
compositions. Our extensive experiments showed that the causal language models
based materials transformers can generate chemically valid materials
compositions with as high as 97.54\% to be charge neutral and 91.40\% to be
electronegativity balanced, which has more than 6 times higher enrichment
compared to a baseline pseudo-random sampling algorithm. These models also
demonstrate high novelty and their potential in new materials discovery has
been proved by their capability to recover the leave-out materials. We also
find that the properties of the generated samples can be tailored by training
the models with selected training sets such as high-bandgap materials. Our
experiments also showed that different models each have their own preference in
terms of the properties of the generated samples and their running time
complexity varies a lot. We have applied our materials transformer models to
discover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations.</p>

    <p>Efficient algorithms to generate candidate crystal structures with good
stability properties can play a key role in data-driven materials discovery.
Here we show that a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) is
capable of generating two-dimensional (2D) materials of high chemical and
structural diversity and formation energies mirroring the training structures.
Specifically, we train the CDVAE on 2615 2D materials with energy above the
convex hull $\Delta H_{\mathrm{hull}}< 0.3$ eV/atom, and generate 5003
materials that we relax using density functional theory (DFT). We also generate
14192 new crystals by systematic element substitution of the training
structures. We find that the generative model and lattice decoration approach
are complementary and yield materials with similar stability properties but
very different crystal structures and chemical compositions. In total we find
11630 predicted new 2D materials, where 8599 of these have $\Delta
H_{\mathrm{hull}}< 0.3$ eV/atom as the seed structures, while 2004 are within
50 meV of the convex hull and could potentially be synthesized. The relaxed
atomic structures of all the materials are available in the open Computational
2D Materials Database (C2DB). Our work establishes the CDVAE as an efficient
and reliable crystal generation machine, and significantly expands the space of
2D materials.</p>

    <p>Recognition of structure prototypes from tremendous known inorganic crystal
structures has been an important subject beneficial for material science
research and new materials design. The existing databases of inorganic crystal
structure prototypes were mostly constructed by classifying materials in terms
of the crystallographic space group information. Herein, we employed a distinct
strategy to construct the inorganic crystal structure prototype database,
relying on the classification of materials in terms of local atomic
environments (LAE) accompanied by unsupervised machine learning method.
Specifically, we adopted a hierarchical clustering approach onto all
experimentally known inorganic crystal structures data to identify structure
prototypes. The criterion for hierarchical clustering is the LAE represented by
the state-of-the-art structure fingerprints of the improved bond-orientational
order parameters and the smooth overlap of atomic positions. This allows us to
build up a LAE-based Inorganic Crystal Structure Prototype Database (LAE-ICSPD)
containing 15,613 structure prototypes with defined stoichiometries. In
addition, we have developed a Structure Prototype Generator Infrastructure
(SPGI) package, which is a useful toolkit for structure prototype generation.
Our developed SPGI toolkit and LAE-ICSPD are beneficial for investigating
inorganic materials in a global way as well as accelerating materials discovery

    <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) occurs in solids with broken inversion
symmetry and refers to DC current generation due to uniform illumination,
without the need of heterostructures or interfaces, a feature that is distinct
from the traditional photovoltaic effect. Its existence has been demonstrated
almost 50 years ago, but predictive theories only appeared in the last ten
years, allowing for the identification of different mechanisms and the
determination of their relative importance in real materials. It is now
generally accepted that there is an intrinsic mechanism that is insensitive to
scattering, called shift current, where first-principles calculations can now
give highly accurate predictions. Another important but more extrinsic
mechanism, called ballistic current, is also attracting a lot of attention, but
due to the complicated scattering processes, its numerical calculation for real
materials is only made possible quite recently. In addition, an intrinsic
ballistic current, usually referred to as injection current, will appear under
circularly-polarized light and has wide application in experiments. In this
article, experiments that are pertinent to the theory development are reviewed,
and a significant portion is devoted to discussing the recent progress in the
theories of BPVE and their numerical implementations. As a demonstration of the
capability of the newly developed theories, a brief review of the materials
design strategies enabled by the theory development is given. Finally,
remaining questions in the BPVE field and possible future directions are
discussed to inspire further investigations.</p>

    <p>Modern advanced manufacturing and advanced materials design often require
searches of relatively high-dimensional process control parameter spaces for
settings that result in optimal structure, property, and performance
parameters. The mapping from the former to the latter must be determined from
noisy experiments or from expensive simulations. We abstract this problem to a
mathematical framework in which an unknown function from a control space to a
design space must be ascertained by means of expensive noisy measurements,
which locate optimal control settings generating desired design features within
specified tolerances, with quantified uncertainty. We describe targeted
adaptive design (TAD), a new algorithm that performs this sampling task
efficiently. TAD creates a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown
mapping at each iterative stage, proposing a new batch of control settings to
sample experimentally and optimizing the updated log-predictive likelihood of
the target design. TAD either stops upon locating a solution with uncertainties
that fit inside the tolerance box or uses a measure of expected future
information to determine that the search space has been exhausted with no
solution. TAD thus embodies the exploration-exploitation tension in a manner
that recalls, but is essentially different from, Bayesian optimization and
optimal experimental design.</p>

    <p>A key problem in network theory is how to reconfigure a graph in order to
optimize a quantifiable objective. Given the ubiquity of networked systems,
such work has broad practical applications in a variety of situations, ranging
from drug and material design to telecommunications. The large decision space
of possible reconfigurations, however, makes this problem computationally
intensive. In this paper, we cast the problem of network rewiring for
optimizing a specified structural property as a Markov Decision Process (MDP),
in which a decision-maker is given a budget of modifications that are performed
sequentially. We then propose a general approach based on the Deep Q-Network
(DQN) algorithm and graph neural networks (GNNs) that can efficiently learn
strategies for rewiring networks. We then discuss a cybersecurity case study,
i.e., an application to the computer network reconfiguration problem for
intrusion protection. In a typical scenario, an attacker might have a (partial)
map of the system they plan to penetrate; if the network is effectively
"scrambled", they would not be able to navigate it since their prior knowledge
would become obsolete. This can be viewed as an entropy maximization problem,
in which the goal is to increase the surprise of the network. Indeed, entropy
acts as a proxy measurement of the difficulty of navigating the network
topology. We demonstrate the general ability of the proposed method to obtain
better entropy gains than random rewiring on synthetic and real-world graphs
while being computationally inexpensive, as well as being able to generalize to
larger graphs than those seen during training. Simulations of attack scenarios
confirm the effectiveness of the learned rewiring strategies.</p>

    <p>Deep graph learning has achieved remarkable progresses in both business and

various reliability and safety aspects of the graph learning framework
including but not limited to robustness, explainability, and privacy. In this

    <p>Transformer models have been developed in molecular science with excellent
performance in applications including quantitative structure-activity
relationship (QSAR) and virtual screening (VS). Compared with other types of
models, however, they are large, which results in a high hardware requirement
to abridge time for both training and inference processes. In this work,
cross-layer parameter sharing (CLPS), and knowledge distillation (KD) are used
to reduce the sizes of transformers in molecular science. Both methods not only
have competitive QSAR predictive performance as compared to the original BERT
model, but also are more parameter efficient. Furthermore, by integrating CLPS
and KD into a two-state chemical network, we introduce a new deep lite chemical
transformer model, DeLiCaTe. DeLiCaTe captures general-domains as well as
task-specific knowledge, which lead to a 4x faster rate of both training and
inference due to a 10- and 3-times reduction of the number of parameters and
layers, respectively. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable performance in QSAR and
VS modeling. Moreover, we anticipate that the model compression strategy
provides a pathway to the creation of effective generative transformer models
for organic drug and material design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Deep Generative Machine Learning Models have been growing in popularity
across the design community thanks to their ability to learn and mimic complex
data distributions. While early works are promising, further advancement will
depend on addressing several critical considerations such as design quality,
feasibility, novelty, and targeted inverse design. We propose the Design Target
Achievement Index (DTAI), a differentiable, tunable metric that scores a
design's ability to achieve designer-specified minimum performance targets. We
demonstrate that DTAI can drastically improve the performance of generated
designs when directly used as a training loss in Deep Generative Models. We
apply the DTAI loss to a Performance-Augmented Diverse GAN (PaDGAN) and
demonstrate superior generative performance compared to a set of baseline Deep
Generative Models including a Multi-Objective PaDGAN and specialized tabular
generation algorithms like the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN). We further
enhance PaDGAN with an auxiliary feasibility classifier to encourage feasible
designs. To evaluate methods, we propose a comprehensive set of evaluation
metrics for generative methods that focus on feasibility, diversity, and
satisfaction of design performance targets. Methods are tested on a challenging
benchmarking problem: the FRAMED bicycle frame design dataset featuring
mixed-datatype parametric data, heavily skewed and multimodal distributions,
and ten competing performance objectives.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of high-$T_c$ conventional superconductivity in high-pressure
hydrides has helped establish computational methods as a formidable tool to
guide material discoveries in a field traditionally dominated by serendipitous
experimental search. This paves the way to an ever-increasing use of
data-driven approaches to the study and design of superconductors. In this
work, we propose a new method to generate meaningful datasets of
superconductors, based on element substitution into a small set of
representative structural templates, generated by crystal structure prediction
methods (MultiTemplate-HighThroughput approach). Our approach realizes an
optimal compromise between structural variety and computational efficiency, and
can be easily generalized to other elements and compositions. As a first
application, we apply it to binary hydrides at high pressure, realizing a
database of 880 hypothetical structures, characterized with a set of
electronic, vibrational and chemical descriptors. 139 structures of our
$Superhydra$ Database are superconducting according to the McMillan-Allen-Dynes
approximation. Studying the distribution of $T_c$ and other properties across
the database with advanced statistical and visualization techniques, we are
able to obtain comprehensive material maps of the phase space of binary
hydrides. The $Superhydra$ database can be thought as a first step of a
generalized effort to map conventional superconductivity.</p>

    <p>Non-Hermitian systems offer new platforms for unusual physical properties
that can be flexibly manipulated by redistribution of the real and imaginary
parts of refractive indices, whose presence breaks conventional wave
propagation symmetries, leading to asymmetric reflection and symmetric
transmission with respect to the wave propagation direction. Here, we use
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for knowledge acquisition in
non-Hermitian systems which accelerate the inverse design process. In
particular, we construct a deep learning model that relates the transmission
and asymmetric reflection in non-conservative settings and proposes
sub-manifold learning to recognize non-Hermitian features from transmission
spectra. The developed deep learning framework determines the feasibility of a
desired spectral response for a given structure and uncovers the role of
effective gain-loss parameters to tailor the spectral response. These findings
pave the way for intelligent inverse design and shape our understanding of the
physical mechanism in general non-Hermitian systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of novel inhibitor molecules for emerging drug-target proteins
is widely acknowledged as a challenging inverse design problem: Exhaustive
exploration of the vast chemical search space is impractical, especially when
the target structure or active molecules are unknown. Here we validate
experimentally the broad utility of a deep generative framework trained
at-scale on protein sequences, small molecules, and their mutual interactions
-- that is unbiased toward any specific target. As demonstrators, we consider
two dissimilar and relevant SARS-CoV-2 targets: the main protease and the spike
protein (receptor binding domain, RBD). To perform target-aware design of novel
inhibitor molecules, a protein sequence-conditioned sampling on the generative
foundation model is performed. Despite using only the target sequence
information, and without performing any target-specific adaptation of the
generative model, micromolar-level inhibition was observed in in vitro
experiments for two candidates out of only four synthesized for each target.
The most potent spike RBD inhibitor also exhibited activity against several
variants in live virus neutralization assays. These results therefore establish
that a single, broadly deployable generative foundation model for accelerated
hit discovery is effective and efficient, even in the most general case where
neither target structure nor binder information is available.</p>

    <p>This work harnesses interpretable machine learning methods to address the
challenging inverse design problem of origami-inspired systems. We show that a
decision tree-random forest method is particularly suitable for fitting origami
databases, containing both design features and functional performance, to
generate human-understandable decision rules for the inverse design of
functional origami. First, the tree method is unique because it can handle
complex interactions between categorical features and continuous features,
allowing it to compare different origami patterns for a design. Second, this
interpretable method can tackle multi-objective problems for designing
functional origami with multiple and multi-physical performance targets.
Finally, the method can extend existing shape-fitting algorithms for origami to
consider non-geometrical performance. The proposed framework enables holistic
inverse design of origami, considering both shape and function, to build novel
reconfigurable structures for various applications such as metamaterials,
deployable structures, soft robots, biomedical devices, and many more.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we introduce an approach for the prediction of capacity for
over 100,000 spinel compounds relevant for battery materials, from which we
propose the 20 most promising candidate materials. In the design of batteries,
selecting the proper material is difficult because there are so many metrics to
consider, including capacity which is a fundamental engineering property. Using
reported experimental data as our starting point, we demonstrate how we can
build a dataset that provides a guide for the selection of battery materials.
Although we focus on capacity of Li based spinel structures for electrode
materials relevant for usage in batteries, the methodology developed and
demonstrated here can be adapted to other properties, structures, and site
occupancies. Further, theoretical capacity is often used as a guideline for
material design of battery materials. In this paper, we show how this is
insufficient for representing experimental measurements, while our methodology
closes this gap and provides an accurate computational representation of
experimental data.</p>

    <p>The braking performance of the brake system is a target performance that must
be considered for vehicle development. Apparent piston travel (APT) and drag
torque are the most representative factors for evaluating braking performance.
In particular, as the two performance factors have a conflicting relationship
with each other, a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) approach is
required for brake design. However, the computational cost of MDO increases as
the number of disciplines increases. Recent studies on inverse design that use
deep learning (DL) have established the possibility of instantly generating an
optimal design that can satisfy the target performance without implementing an
iterative optimization process. This study proposes a DL-based
multidisciplinary inverse design (MID) that simultaneously satisfies multiple
targets, such as the APT and drag torque of the brake system. Results show that
the proposed inverse design can find the optimal design more efficiently
compared with the conventional optimization methods, such as backpropagation
and sequential quadratic programming. The MID achieved a similar performance to
the single-disciplinary inverse design in terms of accuracy and computational
cost. A novel design was derived on the basis of results, and the same
performance was satisfied as that of the existing design.</p>

    <p>The design of materials structure for optimizing functional properties and
potentially, the discovery of novel behaviors is a keystone problem in
materials science. In many cases microstructural models underpinning materials
functionality are available and well understood. However, optimization of
average properties via microstructural engineering often leads to
combinatorically intractable problems. Here, we explore the use of the
reinforcement learning (RL) for microstructure optimization targeting the
discovery of the physical mechanisms behind enhanced functionalities. We
illustrate that RL can provide insights into the mechanisms driving properties
of interest in a 2D discrete Landau ferroelectrics simulator. Intriguingly, we
find that non-trivial phenomena emerge if the rewards are assigned to favor
physically impossible tasks, which we illustrate through rewarding RL agents to
rotate polarization vectors to energetically unfavorable positions. We further
find that strategies to induce polarization curl can be non-intuitive, based on
analysis of learned agent policies. This study suggests that RL is a promising
machine learning method for material design optimization tasks, and for better
understanding the dynamics of microstructural simulations.</p>

    <p>The ultimate goal of various fields is to directly generate molecules with
desired properties, such as finding water-soluble molecules in drug development
and finding molecules suitable for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) or
photosensitizers in the field of development of new organic materials. In this
respect, this study proposes a molecular graph generative model based on the
autoencoder for de novo design. The performance of molecular graph conditional
variational autoencoder (MGCVAE) for generating molecules having specific
desired properties is investigated by comparing it to molecular graph
variational autoencoder (MGVAE). Furthermore, multi-objective optimization for
MGCVAE was applied to satisfy two selected properties simultaneously. In this
study, two physical properties -- logP and molar refractivity -- were used as
optimization targets for the purpose of designing de novo molecules, especially
in drug discovery. As a result, it was confirmed that among generated
molecules, 25.89% optimized molecules were generated in MGCVAE compared to
0.66% in MGVAE. Hence, it demonstrates that MGCVAE effectively produced
drug-like molecules with two target properties. The results of this study
suggest that these graph-based data-driven models are one of the effective
methods of designing new molecules that fulfill various physical properties,

    <p>Designing physical artifacts that serve a purpose - such as tools and other
functional structures - is central to engineering as well as everyday human
behavior. Though automating design has tremendous promise, general-purpose
methods do not yet exist. Here we explore a simple, fast, and robust approach
to inverse design which combines learned forward simulators based on graph
neural networks with gradient-based design optimization. Our approach solves
high-dimensional problems with complex physical dynamics, including designing
surfaces and tools to manipulate fluid flows and optimizing the shape of an
airfoil to minimize drag. This framework produces high-quality designs by
propagating gradients through trajectories of hundreds of steps, even when
using models that were pre-trained for single-step predictions on data
substantially different from the design tasks. In our fluid manipulation tasks,
the resulting designs outperformed those found by sampling-based optimization
techniques. In airfoil design, they matched the quality of those obtained with
a specialized solver. Our results suggest that despite some remaining
challenges, machine learning-based simulators are maturing to the point where
they can support general-purpose design optimization across a variety of
domains.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Despite significant progress of generative models in the natural sciences,
their controllability remains challenging. One fundamentally missing aspect of
molecular or protein generative models is an inductive bias that can reflect
continuous properties of interest. To that end, we propose the Regression
Transformer (RT), a novel method that abstracts regression as a conditional
sequence modeling problem. This introduces a new paradigm of multitask language
models which seamlessly bridge sequence regression and conditional sequence
generation.
  We thoroughly demonstrate that, despite using a nominal-scale training
objective, the RT matches or surpasses the performance of conventional
regression models in property prediction tasks of small molecules, proteins and
chemical reactions. Critically, priming the same model with continuous
properties yields a highly competitive conditional generative model that
outperforms specialized approaches in a substructure-constrained,
property-driven molecule generation benchmark. Our dichotomous approach is
facilitated by a novel, alternating training scheme that enables the model to
decorate seed sequences by desired properties, e.g., to optimize reaction
yield.
  In sum, the RT is the first report of a multitask model that concurrently
excels at predictive and generative tasks in biochemistry. This finds
particular application in property-driven, local exploration of the chemical or
protein space and could pave the road toward foundation models in material
design.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We introduce a new method for inverse design of nanophotonic devices which
guarantees that resulting designs satisfy strict length scale constraints -
including minimum width and spacing constraints required by commercial
semiconductor foundries. The method adopts several concepts from machine
learning to transform the problem of topology optimization with strict length
scale constraints to an unconstrained stochastic gradient optimization problem.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional generator for feasible designs and
adopt a straight-through estimator for backpropagation of gradients to a latent
design. We demonstrate the performance and reliability of our method by
designing several common integrated photonic components.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Periodic graphs are graphs consisting of repetitive local structures, such as
crystal nets and polygon mesh. Their generative modeling has great potential in
real-world applications such as material design and graphics synthesis.
Classical models either rely on domain-specific predefined generation
principles (e.g., in crystal net design), or follow geometry-based prescribed
rules. Recently, deep generative models has shown great promise in
automatically generating general graphs. However, their advancement into
periodic graphs have not been well explored due to several key challenges in 1)
maintaining graph periodicity; 2) disentangling local and global patterns; and
3) efficiency in learning repetitive patterns. To address them, this paper
proposes Periodical-Graph Disentangled Variational Auto-encoder (PGD-VAE), a
new deep generative models for periodic graphs that can automatically learn,
disentangle, and generate local and global graph patterns. Specifically, we
develop a new periodic graph encoder consisting of global-pattern encoder and
local-pattern encoder that ensures to disentangle the representation into
global and local semantics. We then propose a new periodic graph decoder
consisting of local structure decoder, neighborhood decoder, and global
structure decoder, as well as the assembler of their outputs that guarantees
periodicity. Moreover, we design a new model learning objective that helps
ensure the invariance of local-semantic representations for the graphs with the
same local structure. Comprehensive experimental evaluations have been
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code of
proposed PGD-VAE is availabe at https://github.com/shi-yu-wang/PGD-VAE.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine-learning generative methods for material design are constructed by
representing a given chemical structure, either a solid or a molecule, over
appropriate atomic features, generally called structural descriptors. These
must be fully descriptive of the system, must facilitate the training process
and must be invertible, so that one can extract the atomic configurations
corresponding to the output of the model. In general, this last requirement is
not automatically satisfied by the most efficient structural descriptors,
namely the representation is not directly invertible. Such drawback severely
limits our freedom of choice in selecting the most appropriate descriptors for
the problem, and thus our flexibility to construct generative models. In this
work, we present a general optimization method capable of inverting any local
many-body descriptor of the chemical environment, back to a cartesian
representation. The algorithm is then implemented together with the bispectrum
representation of the local structure and demonstrated for a number of
molecules. The scheme presented here, thus, represents a general approach to
the inversion of structural descriptors, enabling the construction of efficient
structural generative models.</p>

optimistic extrapolative predictive performance. Smaller datasets relying on AD
are typically able to identify new materials with desired properties but do so
in a constrained design space. In larger datasets, the low-hanging fruit of
materials optimization is typically already discovered, and the models are
generally less successful at extrapolating to new materials, especially when
the model training data favors a particular type of material. The large

    <p>Understanding ferroelectricity is of both fundamental and technological
importance to further stimulate the development of new materials designs and
manipulations. Here, we perform an in-depth first-principle study on the
well-known ferroelectric barium titanate BaTiO$_{3}$ under a hydrostatic
negative pressure, showing an isosymmetric phase transition to a
supertetragonal phase with high $c/a$ ratio of $\sim1.3$. The microscopic
origin and driving mechanisms of this phase transition are identified as a
drastic change of the covalently $\pi$-bonded electrons. These findings provide
guidance in the search for new supertetragonal phases, with great opportunities
for novel multiferroic materials; and can be generalized in the understanding
of other isosymmetric phase transitions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Knowledge of phase diagrams is essential for material design as it helps in
understanding microstructure evolution during processing. The determination of
phase diagrams is thus one of the central tasks in materials science. When
exploring new materials for which the phase diagram is unknown,
experimentalists often try to determine the key experiments that should be
performed by referencing known phase diagrams of similar systems. To enhance
this practical strategy, we attempted to estimate unknown phase diagrams based
on known phase diagrams using a machine learning-based classification approach.
As a proof of concept, we focused on predicting the number of coexisting phases
across the 800 K isothermal section of each of the 10 ternaries of the
Al-Cu-Mg-Si-Zn system from the other 9 sections. To increase the prediction
accuracy, we introduced new descriptors generated from the thermodynamic
properties of the elements and CALPHAD extrapolations from lower-order systems.
Using the random forest method, the presence of single-, two-, and three-phase
domains was predicted with an average accuracy of 84% across all 10 considered
sections with a standard deviation of 11%. The proposed approach represents a
promising tool for assisting the investigator in developing new materials and
determining phase equilibria efficiently.</p>

    <p>Deep learning (DL) inverse techniques have increased the speed of artificial
electromagnetic material (AEM) design and improved the quality of resulting
devices. Many DL inverse techniques have succeeded on a number of AEM design
tasks, but to compare, contrast, and evaluate assorted techniques it is
critical to clarify the underlying ill-posedness of inverse problems. Here we
review state-of-the-art approaches and present a comprehensive survey of deep
learning inverse methods and invertible and conditional invertible neural
networks to AEM design. We produce easily accessible and rapidly implementable
AEM design benchmarks, which offers a methodology to efficiently determine the
DL technique best suited to solving different design challenges. Our
methodology is guided by constraints on repeated simulation and an easily
integrated metric, which we propose expresses the relative ill-posedness of any
AEM design problem. We show that as the problem becomes increasingly ill-posed,
the neural adjoint with boundary loss (NA) generates better solutions faster,
regardless of simulation constraints. On simpler AEM design tasks, direct
neural networks (NN) fare better when simulations are limited, while geometries
predicted by mixture density networks (MDN) and conditional variational
auto-encoders (VAE) can improve with continued sampling and re-simulation.</p>

    <p>Designing new industrial materials with desired properties can be very
expensive and time consuming. The main difficulty is to generate compounds that
correspond to realistic materials. Indeed, the description of compounds as
vectors of components' proportions is characterized by discrete features and a
severe sparsity. Furthermore, traditional generative model validation processes
as visual verification, FID and Inception scores are tailored for images and
cannot then be used as such in this context. To tackle these issues, we develop
an original Binded-VAE model dedicated to the generation of discrete datasets
with high sparsity. We validate the model with novel metrics adapted to the
problem of compounds generation. We show on a real issue of rubber compound
design that the proposed approach outperforms the standard generative models
which opens new perspectives for material design optimization.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Data driven generative machine learning models have recently emerged as one
of the most promising approaches for new materials discovery. While the
generator models can generate millions of candidates, it is critical to train
fast and accurate machine learning models to filter out stable, synthesizable
materials with desired properties. However, such efforts to build supervised
regression or classification screening models have been severely hindered by
the lack of unstable or unsynthesizable samples, which usually are not
collected and deposited in materials databases such as ICSD and Materials
Project (MP). At the same time, there are a significant amount of unlabelled
data available in these databases. Here we propose a semi-supervised deep
neural network (TSDNN) model for high-performance formation energy and
synthesizability prediction, which is achieved via its unique teacher-student
dual network architecture and its effective exploitation of the large amount of
unlabeled data. For formation energy based stability screening, our
semi-supervised classifier achieves an absolute 10.3\% accuracy improvement
compared to the baseline CGCNN regression model. For synthesizability
prediction, our model significantly increases the baseline PU learning's true
positive rate from 87.9\% to 97.9\% using 1/49 model parameters.
  To further prove the effectiveness of our models, we combined our
TSDNN-energy and TSDNN-synthesizability models with our CubicGAN generator to
discover novel stable cubic structures. Out of 1000 recommended candidate
samples by our models, 512 of them have negative formation energies as
validated by our DFT formation energy calculations. Our experimental results
show that our semi-supervised deep neural networks can significantly improve
the screening accuracy in large-scale generative materials design.</p>

    <p>2D materials find promising applications in next-generation devices, however,
large-scale, low-defect, and reproducible synthesis of 2D materials remains a
challenging task. To assist in the selection of suitable substrates for the
synthesis of as-yet hypothetical 2D materials, we have developed an open-source
high-throughput workflow package, $Hetero2d$, that searches for low-lattice
mismatched substrate surfaces for any 2D material and determines the stability
of these 2D-substrate heterostructures using density functional theory (DFT)
simulations. $Hetero2d$ automates the generation of 2D-substrate
heterostructures, the creation of DFT input files, the submission and
monitoring of computational jobs on supercomputing facilities, and the storage
of relevant parameters alongside the post-processed results in a MongoDB
database. We demonstrate the capability of $Hetero2d$ in identifying stable
2D-substrate heterostructures for four 2D materials, namely $2H$-MoS$_2$, $1T$-
and $2H$-NbO$_2$, and hexagonal-ZnTe, considering 50 cubic elemental
substrates. We find Cu, Hf, Mn, Nd, Ni, Pd, Re, Rh, Sc, Ta, Ti, V, W, Y, and Zr
substrates sufficiently stabilize the formation energies of these 2D materials,
with binding energies in the range of ~0.1 - 0.6 eV/atom. Upon examining the
$z$-separation, the charge transfer, and the electronic density of states at
the 2D-substrate interface, we find a covalent type bonding at the interface
which suggests that these substrates can be used as contact materials for the
2D materials. $Hetero2d$ (https://github.com/cmdlab/Hetero2d) is available on

    <p>Deep generative models of molecules have grown immensely in popularity,
trained on relevant datasets, these models are used to search through chemical
space. The downstream utility of generative models for the inverse design of
novel functional compounds depends on their ability to learn a training
distribution of molecules. The most simple example is a language model that
takes the form of a recurrent neural network and generates molecules using a
string representation. More sophisticated are graph generative models, which
sequentially construct molecular graphs and typically achieve state of the art
results. However, recent work has shown that language models are more capable
than once thought, particularly in the low data regime. In this work, we
investigate the capacity of simple language models to learn distributions of
molecules. For this purpose, we introduce several challenging generative
modeling tasks by compiling especially complex distributions of molecules. On
each task, we evaluate the ability of language models as compared with two
widely used graph generative models. The results demonstrate that language
models are powerful generative models, capable of adeptly learning complex
molecular distributions -- and yield better performance than the graph models.
Language models can accurately generate: distributions of the highest scoring
penalized LogP molecules in ZINC15, multi-modal molecular distributions as well
as the largest molecules in PubChem.</p>

    <p>Photo-acid generators (PAGs) are compounds that release acids ($H^+$ ions)
when exposed to light. These compounds are critical components of the
photolithography processes that are used in the manufacture of semiconductor
logic and memory chips. The exponential increase in the demand for

widely employed for drug discovery and material design, its application to the
creation of novel photo-acid generators poses several unique challenges, such
as lack of property labels. In this paper, we highlight these challenges and
propose a generative modeling approach that utilizes conditional generation
from a pre-trained deep autoencoder and expert-in-the-loop techniques. The
validity of the proposed approach was evaluated with the help of subject matter
experts, indicating the promise of such an approach for applications beyond the
creation of novel photo-acid generators.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topologically protected whirling magnetic textures could emerge as data
carriers in next-generation post-Moore computing. Such textures are abundantly
observed in ferromagnets (FMs); however, their antiferromagnetic (AFM)
counterparts are expected to be even more relevant for device applications, as
they promise ultra-fast, deflection-free dynamics whilst being robust against
external fields. Unfortunately, they have remained elusive, hence identifying
materials hosting such textures is key to developing this technology. Here, we
present comprehensive micromagnetic and analytical models investigating
topological textures in the broad material class of A-type antiferromagnets,
specifically focusing on the prototypical case of $\alpha \text{-Fe}_2
\text{O}_3$,an emerging candidate for AFM spintronics. By exploiting a symmetry
breaking interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI), it is possible
to stabilize a wide topological family, including AFM (anti)merons and bimerons
and the hitherto undiscovered AFM skyrmions. Whilst iDMI enforces homochirality
and improves the stability of these textures, the widely tunable anisotropy and
exchange interactions enable unprecedented control of their core dimensions. We
then present a unifying framework to model the scaling of texture sizes based
on a simple dimensional analysis. As the parameters required to host and tune
homochiral AFM textures may be obtained by rational materials design of $\alpha
\text{-Fe}_2 \text{O}_3$, it could emerge as a promising platform to initiate
AFM topological spintronics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Fast and accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms and web
servers are highly desirable for exploring and discovering new materials out of
the infinite design space. However, currently, the computationally expensive
first principle calculation based crystal structure prediction algorithms are
applicable to relatively small systems and are out of reach of most materials
researchers due to the requirement of high computing resources or the software
cost related to ab initio code such as VASP. Several computational teams have
used an element substitution approach for generating or predicting new
structures, but usually in an ad hoc way. Here we develop a template based
crystal structure prediction algorithm (TCSP) and its companion web server,
which makes this tool to be accessible to all materials researchers. Our
algorithm uses elemental/chemical similarity and oxidation states to guide the
selection of template structures and then rank them based on the substitution
compatibility and can return multiple predictions with ranking scores in a few
minutes. Benchmark study on the ~98,290 formulas of the Materials Project
database using leave-one-out evaluation shows that our algorithm can achieve
high accuracy (for 13,145 target structures, TCSP predicted their structures
with RMSD < 0.1) for a large portion of the formulas. We have also used TCSP to
discover new materials of the Ga-B-N system showing its potential for
high-throughput materials discovery. Our user-friendly web app TCSP can be
accessed freely at \url{www.materialsatlas.org/crystalstructure} on our
MaterialsAtlas.org web app platform.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Data based materials science is the new promise to accelerate materials
design. Especially in computational materials science, data generation can
easily be automatized. Usually, the focus is on processing and evaluating the
data to derive rules or to discover new materials, while less attention is
being paid on the strategy to generate the data. In this work, we show that by
a sequential design of experiment scheme, the process of generating and
learning from the data can be combined to discover the relevant sections of the
parameter space. Our example is the energy of grain boundaries as a function of
their geometric degrees of freedom, calculated via atomistic simulations. The
sampling of this grain boundary energy space, or even subspaces of it,
represents a challenge due to the presence of deep cusps of the energy, which
are located at irregular intervals of the geometric parameters. Existing
approaches to sample grain boundary energy subspaces therefore either need a
huge amount of datapoints or a~priori knowledge of the positions of these
cusps. We combine statistical methods with atomistic simulations and a
sequential sampling technique and compare this strategy to a regular sampling
technique. We thereby demonstrate that this sequential design is able to sample
a subspace with a minimal amount of points while finding unknown cusps
automatically.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topology optimization of modular structures and mechanisms enables balancing
the performance of automatically-generated individualized designs, as required
by Industry 4.0, with enhanced sustainability by means of component reuse. For
optimal modular design, two key questions must be answered: (i) what should the
topology of individual modules be like and (ii) how should modules be arranged
at the product scale? We address these challenges by proposing a bi-level
sequential strategy that combines free material design, clustering techniques,
and topology optimization. First, using free material optimization enhanced
with post-processing for checkerboard suppression, we determine the
distribution of elasticity tensors at the product scale. To extract the
sought-after modular arrangement, we partition the obtained elasticity tensors
with a novel deterministic clustering algorithm and interpret its outputs
within Wang tiling formalism. Finally, we design interiors of individual
modules by solving a single-scale topology optimization problem with the design
space reduced by modular mapping, conveniently starting from an initial guess
provided by free material optimization. We illustrate these developments with
three benchmarks first, covering compliance minimization of modular structures,
and, for the first time, the design of non-periodic compliant modular
mechanisms. Furthermore, we design a set of modules reusable in an inverter and
in gripper mechanisms, which ultimately pave the way towards the rational
design of modular architectured (meta)materials.</p>

    <p>Machine learning models can assist with metamaterials design by approximating
computationally expensive simulators or solving inverse design problems.
However, past work has usually relied on black box deep neural networks, whose
reasoning processes are opaque and require enormous datasets that are expensive
to obtain. In this work, we develop two novel machine learning approaches to
metamaterials discovery that have neither of these disadvantages. These
approaches, called shape-frequency features and unit-cell templates, can
discover 2D metamaterials with user-specified frequency band gaps. Our
approaches provide logical rule-based conditions on metamaterial unit-cells
that allow for interpretable reasoning processes, and generalize well across
design spaces of different resolutions. The templates also provide design
flexibility where users can almost freely design the fine resolution features
of a unit-cell without affecting the user's desired band gap.</p>

    <p>Mechanical metamaterials are periodic lattice structures with complex unit
cell architectures that can achieve extraordinary mechanical properties beyond
the capability of bulk materials. A new class of metamaterials is proposed,
whose mechanical properties rely on deformation-induced transitions in
nodal-topology by formation of internal self-contact. The universal nature of
the principle presented, is demonstrated for tension, compression, shear and
torsion. In particular, it is shown that by frustration of soft deformation
modes, large highly non-linear stiffening effects can be generated. Tunable
non-linear elasticity can be exploited to design materials mimicking the

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning (ML)-accelerated discovery requires large amounts of
high-fidelity data to reveal predictive structure-property relationships. For
many properties of interest in materials discovery, the challenging nature and
high cost of data generation has resulted in a data landscape that is both
scarcely populated and of dubious quality. Data-driven techniques starting to
overcome these limitations include the use of consensus across functionals in
density functional theory, the development of new functionals or accelerated
electronic structure theories, and the detection of where computationally
demanding methods are most necessary. When properties cannot be reliably
simulated, large experimental data sets can be used to train ML models. In the
absence of manual curation, increasingly sophisticated natural language
processing and automated image analysis are making it possible to learn
structure-property relationships from the literature. Models trained on these
data sets will improve as they incorporate community feedback.</p>

    <p>Machine learning (ML) has emerged into formidable force for identifying

subsequent generation of automated predictive behavior. In the recent years, it
is safe to conclude that ML and its close cousin deep learning (DL) have

chemistry. Not only the classical variants of ML , even those trainable on
near-term quantum hardwares have been developed with promising outcomes. Such
algorithms have revolutionzed material design and performance of
photo-voltaics, electronic structure calculations of ground and excited states
of correlated matter, computation of force-fields and potential energy surfaces
informing chemical reaction dynamics, reactivity inspired rational strategies
of drug designing and even classification of phases of matter with accurate
identification of emergent criticality. In this review we shall explicate a
subset of such topics and delineate the contributions made by both classical
and quantum computing enhanced machine learning algorithms over the past few
years. We shall not only present a brief overview of the well-known techniques
but also highlight their learning strategies using statistical physical

    <p>Deep learning (DL) is one of the fastest growing topics in materials data
science, with rapidly emerging applications spanning atomistic, image-based,
spectral, and textual data modalities. DL allows analysis of unstructured data
and automated identification of features. Recent development of large materials
databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in
particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely
leveraged synthetic data enabled by high quality forward models as well as by
generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level
overview of deep-learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent
developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging,
spectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we
discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical
modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly
available software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of
recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field
and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas
for DL methods in materials science. The application of DL methods in materials
science presents an exciting avenue for future materials discovery and design.</p>

    <p>The optimization along the chain processing-structure-properties-performance
is one of the core objectives in data-driven materials science. In this sense,
processes are supposed to manufacture workpieces with targeted material
microstructures. These microstructures are defined by the material properties
of interest and identifying them is a question of materials design. In the
present paper, we addresse this issue and introduce a generic multi-task
learning-based optimization approach. The approach enables the identification
of sets of highly diverse microstructures for given desired properties and
corresponding tolerances. Basically, the approach consists of an optimization
algorithm that interacts with a machine learning model that combines multi-task
learning with siamese neural networks. The resulting model (1) relates
microstructures and properties, (2) estimates the likelihood of a
microstructure of being producible, and (3) performs a distance preserving
microstructure feature extraction in order to generate a lower dimensional
latent feature space to enable efficient optimization. The proposed approach is
applied on a crystallographic texture optimization problem for rolled steel
sheets given desired properties.</p>

    <p>Microstructure reconstruction is an important cornerstone to the inverse
materials design concept. In this work, a general algorithm is developed to
reconstruct a three-dimensional microstructure from given descriptors. Based on
two-dimensional (2D) micrographs, this reconstruction algorithm allows valuable
insight through spatial visualization of the microstructure and in silico
studies of structure-property linkages. The formulation ensures computational
efficiency by casting microstructure reconstruction as a gradient-based
optimization problem. Herein, the descriptors can be chosen freely, such as
spatial correlations or Gram matrices, as long as they are differentiable with
respect to the microstructure. Because real microstructure samples are commonly
available as 2D microscopy images only, the desired descriptors for the
reconstruction process are prescribed on orthogonal 2D slices. This adds a
source of noise, which is handled in a new, superior and interpretable manner.
The efficiency and applicability of this formulation is demonstrated by various
numerical experiments.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning for materials discovery has largely focused on predicting an
individual scalar rather than multiple related properties, where spectral
properties are an important example. Fundamental spectral properties include
the phonon density of states (phDOS) and the electronic density of states
(eDOS), which individually or collectively are the origins of a breadth of
materials observables and functions. Building upon the success of graph
attention networks for encoding crystalline materials, we introduce a
probabilistic embedding generator specifically tailored to the prediction of
spectral properties. Coupled with supervised contrastive learning, our
materials-to-spectrum (Mat2Spec) model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for
predicting ab initio phDOS and eDOS for crystalline materials. We demonstrate
Mat2Spec's ability to identify eDOS gaps below the Fermi energy, validating
predictions with ab initio calculations and thereby discovering candidate
thermoelectrics and transparent conductors. Mat2Spec is an exemplar framework
for predicting spectral properties of materials via strategically incorporated
machine learning techniques.</p>

    <p>Automated design synthesis has the potential to revolutionize the modern

customized products across countless industries. Successfully adapting
generative Machine Learning to design engineering may enable such automated
design synthesis and is a research subject of great importance. We present a
review and analysis of Deep Generative Machine Learning models in engineering
design. Deep Generative Models (DGMs) typically leverage deep networks to learn
from an input dataset and synthesize new designs. Recently, DGMs such as
feedforward Neural Networks (NNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and certain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
frameworks have shown promising results in design applications like structural
optimization, materials design, and shape synthesis. The prevalence of DGMs in
engineering design has skyrocketed since 2016. Anticipating continued growth,
we conduct a review of recent advances to benefit researchers interested in
DGMs for design. We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms,
datasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current
literature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new
techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related
domain, or directly supported the development of DGMs through datasets or
auxiliary methods. We further identify key challenges and limitations currently
seen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity, handling
constraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance
simultaneously. In our discussion, we identify possible solution pathways as
key areas on which to target future work.</p>

    <p>Deep learning techniques have been increasingly applied to the natural
sciences, e.g., for property prediction and optimization or material discovery.
A fundamental ingredient of such approaches is the vast quantity of labelled
data needed to train the model; this poses severe challenges in data-scarce
settings where obtaining labels requires substantial computational or labor
resources. Here, we introduce surrogate- and invariance-boosted contrastive
learning (SIB-CL), a deep learning framework which incorporates three
``inexpensive'' and easily obtainable auxiliary information sources to overcome
data scarcity. Specifically, these are: 1)~abundant unlabeled data, 2)~prior
knowledge of symmetries or invariances and 3)~surrogate data obtained at
near-zero cost. We demonstrate SIB-CL's effectiveness and generality on various
scientific problems, e.g., predicting the density-of-states of 2D photonic
crystals and solving the 3D time-independent Schrodinger equation. SIB-CL
consistently results in orders of magnitude reduction in the number of labels
needed to achieve the same network accuracies.</p>

    <p>Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing
challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because
stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible
periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy
minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the
structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between
different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and
often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational
Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material
stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the
decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic
coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy
bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes
interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation,
rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in
three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid,
diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a
specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation
metrics for the broader machine learning community.</p>

analysis hold the promise to accelerate large-scale simulations and their
analysis to hitherto unattainable scales. Machine learning is a rapidly growing
field for the processing of such complex datasets. It has recently gained
traction in the domain of electronic structure simulations, where density
functional theory takes the prominent role of the most widely used electronic
structure method. Thus, DFT calculations represent one of the largest loads on
academic high-performance computing systems across the world. Accelerating
these with machine learning can reduce the resources required and enables
simulations of larger systems. Hence, the combination of density functional
theory and machine learning has the potential to rapidly advance electronic
structure applications such as in-silico materials discovery and the search for
new chemical reaction pathways. We provide the theoretical background of both
density functional theory and machine learning on a generally accessible level.
This serves as the basis of our comprehensive review including research
articles up to December 2020 in chemistry and materials science that employ
machine-learning techniques. In our analysis, we categorize the body of
research into main threads and extract impactful results. We conclude our
review with an outlook on exciting research directions in terms of a citation

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>An overwhelmingly large amount of knowledge in the materials domain is
generated and stored as text published in peer-reviewed scientific literature.
Recent developments in natural language processing, such as bidirectional
encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models, provide promising
tools to extract information from these texts. However, direct application of
these models in the materials domain may yield suboptimal results as the models
themselves may not be trained on notations and jargon that are specific to the
domain. Here, we present a materials-aware language model, namely, MatSciBERT,
which is trained on a large corpus of scientific literature published in the
materials domain. We further evaluate the performance of MatSciBERT on three
downstream tasks, namely, abstract classification, named entity recognition,
and relation extraction, on different materials datasets. We show that
MatSciBERT outperforms SciBERT, a language model trained on science corpus, on
all the tasks. Further, we discuss some of the applications of MatSciBERT in
the materials domain for extracting information, which can, in turn, contribute
to materials discovery or optimization. Finally, to make the work accessible to
the larger materials community, we make the pretrained and finetuned weights
and the models of MatSciBERT freely accessible.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recently many efforts have been devoted to applying graph neural networks
(GNNs) to molecular property prediction which is a fundamental task for
computational drug and material discovery. One of major obstacles to hinder the
successful prediction of molecule property by GNNs is the scarcity of labeled
data. Though graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have achieved
extraordinary performance with insufficient labeled data, most focused on
designing data augmentation schemes for general graphs. However, the
fundamental property of a molecule could be altered with the augmentation
method (like random perturbation) on molecular graphs. Whereas, the critical
geometric information of molecules remains rarely explored under the current
GNN and GCL architectures. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive
learning method utilizing the geometry of the molecule across 2D and 3D views,
which is named GeomGCL. Specifically, we first devise a dual-view geometric
message passing network (GeomMPNN) to adaptively leverage the rich information
of both 2D and 3D graphs of a molecule. The incorporation of geometric
properties at different levels can greatly facilitate the molecular
representation learning. Then a novel geometric graph contrastive scheme is
designed to make both geometric views collaboratively supervise each other to
improve the generalization ability of GeomMPNN. We evaluate GeomGCL on various
downstream property prediction tasks via a finetune process. Experimental
results on seven real-life molecular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed GeomGCL against state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The need for efficient computational screening of molecular candidates that
possess desired properties frequently arises in various scientific and
engineering problems, including drug discovery and materials design. However,
the large size of the search space containing the candidates and the
substantial computational cost of high-fidelity property prediction models
makes screening practically challenging. In this work, we propose a general
framework for constructing and optimizing a virtual screening (HTVS) pipeline
that consists of multi-fidelity models. The central idea is to optimally
allocate the computational resources to models with varying costs and accuracy
to optimize the return-on-computational-investment (ROCI). Based on both
simulated as well as real data, we demonstrate that the proposed optimal HTVS
framework can significantly accelerate screening virtually without any
degradation in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, it enables an adaptive
operational strategy for HTVS, where one can trade accuracy for efficiency.</p>

    <p>Phase transition is one of the most important phenomena in nature and plays a
central role in materials design. All phase transitions are characterized by
suitable order parameters, including the order-disorder phase transition.
However, finding a representative order parameter for complex systems is
nontrivial, such as for high-entropy alloys. Given variational autoencoder's
(VAE) strength of reducing high dimensional data into few principal components,
here we coin a new concept of "VAE order parameter". We propose that the
Manhattan distance in the VAE latent space can serve as a generic order
parameter for order-disorder phase transitions. The physical properties of the
order parameter are quantitatively interpreted and demonstrated by multiple
refractory high-entropy alloys. Assisted by it, a generally applicable alloy
design concept is proposed by mimicking the nature mixing of elements. Our
physically interpretable "VAE order parameter" lays the foundation for the
understanding of and alloy design by chemical ordering.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The inverse approach is computationally efficient in aerodynamic design as
the desired target performance distribution is prespecified. However, it has
some significant limitations that prevent it from achieving full efficiency.
First, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target
distribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to
clarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional
problems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due
to parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic
distribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical
predictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric
constraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization
framework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational
autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target
distribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from
the generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution
optimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed
framework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve
accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through
aerodynamic shape optimizations of the wind turbine airfoil. Their results show
that this framework is accurate, efficient, and flexible to be applied to other
inverse design engineering applications.</p>

    <p>Electron correlations amplify quantum fluctuations and, as such, they have
been recognized as the origin of a rich landscape of quantum phases. Whether
and how they lead to gapless topological states is an outstanding question, and
a framework that allows for determining novel phases and identifying new
materials is in pressing need. Here we advance a general approach, in which
strong correlations cooperate with crystalline symmetry to drive gapless
topological states. We test this materials design principle by exploring Kondo
lattice models and materials whose space group symmetries may promote different
kinds of electronic degeneracies, with a particular focus on square-net
systems. Weyl-Kondo nodal-line semimetals -- with nodes pinned to the Fermi
energy -- are identified. We describe how this approach can be applied to
discover strongly correlated topological semimetals, identify three heavy
fermion compounds as new candidates, provide first direct experimental evidence
for our prediction in Ce$_2$Au$_3$In$_5$, and discuss how our approach may lead
to many more. Our findings illustrate the potential of the proposed materials
design principle to guide the search for new topological metals in a broad
range of strongly correlated systems.</p>

diverse set of virtual structures used to attain the universality. We
demonstrated the applicability of PFP in selected domains: lithium diffusion in
LiFeSO${}_4$F, molecular adsorption in metal-organic frameworks, an
order-disorder transition of Cu-Au alloys, and material discovery for a

    <p>Silicon (Si) is one of the most abundant elements on Earth, and it is the
most important and widely used semiconductor, constituting the basis of modern
electronic devices. Despite extensive study, some properties of Si remain
elusive. For example, the behaviour of Si under high pressure, in particular at
the ultra-high strain rates characteristic of dynamic compression, has been a
matter of debate for decades. A detailed understanding of how Si deforms is
crucial for a variety of fields, ranging from planetary science to materials
design. Simulations suggest that in Si the shear stress generated during shock
compression is released inelastically, i.e., via a high-pressure phase
transition, challenging the classical picture of relaxation via defect-mediated
plasticity. However, experiments at the short timescales characteristic of
shock compression are challenging, and direct evidence supporting either
deformation mechanism remain elusive. Here, we use sub-picosecond,
highly-monochromatic x-ray diffraction to study (100)-oriented single-crystal
Si under laser-driven shock compression. We provide the first unambiguous,
time-resolved picture of Si deformation at ultra-high strain rates,
demonstrating the predicted inelastic shear release. Our results resolve the
longstanding controversy on silicon deformation under dynamic compression, and
provide direct proof of strain rate-dependent deformation mechanisms in a
non-metallic system, which is key for the study of planetary-relevant
materials.</p>

    <p>Deep generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for learning useful
molecular representations and designing novel molecules with desired

most existing deep generative models are restricted due to lack of spatial
information. Here we propose augmentation of deep generative models with
topological data analysis (TDA) representations, known as persistence images,
for robust encoding of 3D molecular geometry. We show that the TDA augmentation
of a character-based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) outperforms
state-of-the-art generative neural nets in accurately modeling the structural
composition of the QM9 benchmark. Generated molecules are valid, novel, and
diverse, while exhibiting distinct electronic property distribution, namely
higher sample population with small HOMO-LUMO gap. These results demonstrate
that TDA features indeed provide crucial geometric signal for learning abstract
structures, which is non-trivial for existing generative models operating on
string, graph, or 3D point sets to capture.</p>

    <p>Variable-density cellular structures can overcome connectivity and
manufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly
those represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such
cellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past
work addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume
fraction of single-type unit cells but ignores the effects of unit cell
geometry on properties, or considers the geometry-property relation but builds
this relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more
principled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a
conditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative
Adversarial Network (IH-GAN). It learns the conditional distribution of unit
cell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from
properties to geometries. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using
the implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries.
Results show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy
given material properties with high accuracy ($R^2$-scores between target
properties and properties of generated unit cells $>98\%$) and 2) improve the
optimized structural performance over the conventional variable-density
single-type structure. In the minimum compliance example, our IH-GAN generated
structure achieves a $79.7\%$ reduction in concentrated stress and an extra
$3.03\%$ reduction in displacement. In the target deformation examples, our
IH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by $86.4\%$ and
$79.6\%$ for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the
connectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer
blending.</p>

generated strings simultaneously satisfy the multiple target properties and
vary for a single condition set. These advances will contribute to improving
the quality of human life by accelerating the process of desired material
discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for the next generation
lithium-ion battery technology. Large scale screening of polymer electrolytes
is hindered by the significant cost of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in
amorphous systems: the amorphous structure of polymers requires multiple,
repeated sampling to reduce noise and the slow relaxation requires long
simulation time for convergence. Here, we accelerate the screening with a
multi-task graph neural network that learns from a large amount of noisy,
unconverged, short MD data and a small number of converged, long MD data. We
achieve accurate predictions of 4 different converged properties and screen a
space of 6247 polymers that is orders of magnitude larger than previous
computational studies. Further, we extract several design principles for
polymer electrolytes and provide an open dataset for the community. Our
approach could be applicable to a broad class of material discovery problems
that involve the simulation of complex, amorphous materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials property predictions have improved from advances in machine
learning algorithms, delivering materials discoveries and novel insights
through data-driven models of structure-property relationships. Nearly all
available models rely on featurization of materials composition, however,
whether the exclusive use of structural knowledge in such models has the
capacity to make comparable predictions remains unknown. Here we employ a deep
neural network model to decode structure-property relationships in crystalline
materials without explicitly considering chemical compositions. The focus is on
classification of crystal systems, mechanical elasticity, electronic band gap,
and phase stability. Our model utilizes a three-dimensional (3D) momentum space
representation of structure from elastic x-ray scattering theory that exhibits
rotation and permutation invariance. We perform novel ablation studies to help
interpret the model performance by perturbing the physically meaningful input
features (i.e., the diffraction patterns) instead of tuning the architecture of
the learning model as in conventional ablation methods. We find that the
spatial symmetry of the 3D diffraction patterns, which reflects crystalline
symmetry operations, is more important than the diffraction intensities
contained within for the model to make a successful classification. Our work
showcases the potential of using statistical learning models to help understand
materials physics, rather than performing predictive and generative tasks as in
most materials informatics research. We also argue that learning the crystal
structure genome in a chemistry-agnostic manner demonstrates that some crystal
structures inherently host high propensities for optimal materials properties,
which enables the decoupling of structure and composition for future codesign
of multifunctionality.</p>

    <p>Crystal structure search is a long-standing challenge in materials design. We
present a dataset of more than 100,000 structural relaxations of potential
battery anode materials from randomized structures using density functional
theory calculations. We illustrate the usage of the dataset by training graph
neural networks to predict structural relaxations from randomly generated
structures. Our models directly predict stresses in addition to forces, which
allows them to accurately simulate relaxations of both ionic positions and
lattice vectors. We show that models trained on the molecular dynamics
simulations fail to simulate relaxations from random structures, while training
on our data leads to up to two orders of magnitude decrease in error for the
same task. Our model is able to find an experimentally verified structure of a
stoichiometry held out from training. We find that randomly perturbing atomic
positions during training improves both the accuracy and out of domain
generalization of the models.</p>

    <p>Large-scale electrification is vital to addressing the climate crisis, but
several scientific and technological challenges remain to fully electrify both
the chemical industry and transportation. In both of these areas, new
electrochemical materials will be critical, but their development currently
relies heavily on human-time-intensive experimental trial and error and
computationally expensive first-principles, meso-scale and continuum
simulations. We present an automated workflow, AutoMat, that accelerates these
computational steps by introducing both automated input generation and
management of simulations across scales from first principles to continuum
device modeling. Furthermore, we show how to seamlessly integrate
multi-fidelity predictions such as machine learning surrogates or automated
robotic experiments "in-the-loop". The automated framework is implemented with
design space search techniques to dramatically accelerate the overall materials
discovery pipeline by implicitly learning design features that optimize device
performance across several metrics. We discuss the benefits of AutoMat using
examples in electrocatalysis and energy storage and highlight lessons learned.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Autonomous materials discovery with desired properties is one of the ultimate
goals for materials science, and the current studies have been focusing mostly
on high-throughput screening based on density functional theory calculations
and forward modelling of physical properties using machine learning. Applying
the deep learning techniques, we have developed a generative model which can
predict distinct stable crystal structures by optimizing the formation energy
in the latent space. It is demonstrated that the optimization of physical
properties can be integrated into the generative model as on-top screening or
backwards propagator, both with their own advantages. Applying the generative
models on the binary Bi-Se system reveals that distinct crystal structures can
be obtained covering the whole composition range, and the phases on the convex
hull can be reproduced after the generated structures are fully relaxed to the
equilibrium. The method can be extended to multicomponent systems for
multi-objective optimization, which paves the way to achieve the inverse design
of materials with optimal properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Realizing general inverse design could greatly accelerate the discovery of
new materials with user-defined properties. However, state-of-the-art
generative models tend to be limited to a specific composition or crystal
structure. Herein, we present a framework capable of general inverse design
(not limited to a given set of elements or crystal structures), featuring a
generalized invertible representation that encodes crystals in both real and
reciprocal space, and a property-structured latent space from a variational
autoencoder (VAE). In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new
crystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE)
power factor, and combinations thereof. These generated crystals, absent in the
training database, are validated by first-principles calculations. The success
rates (number of first-principles-validated target-satisfying crystals/number
of designed crystals) ranges between 7.1% and 38.9%. These results represent a
significant step toward property-driven general inverse design using generative
models, although practical challenges remain when coupled with experimental
synthesis.</p>
