    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction
approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally
expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum
mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative
models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more
rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and
periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling
structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a
symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment
Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these
limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on
an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning
structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known
low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the
ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy
for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as
metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.</p>

    <p>We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials are the foundation of modern society, underpinning advancements in
energy, electronics, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure. The
ability to discover and design new materials with tailored properties is
critical to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. In recent
years, the growing availability of high-quality materials data combined with
rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for
accelerating materials discovery. Data-driven generative models provide a
powerful tool for materials design by directly create novel materials that
satisfy predefined property requirements. Despite the proliferation of related
work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this
area. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent
progress in AI-driven materials generation. We first organize various types of
materials and illustrate multiple representations of crystalline materials. We
then provide a detailed summary and taxonomy of current AI-driven materials
generation approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the common evaluation metrics
and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude
with potential future directions and challenges in this fast-growing field. The

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accelerating inverse design of crystalline materials with generative models
has significant implications for a range of technologies. Unlike other atomic
systems, 3D crystals are invariant to discrete groups of isometries called the
space groups. Crucially, these space group symmetries are known to heavily
influence materials properties. We propose SGEquiDiff, a crystal generative
model which naturally handles space group constraints with space group
invariant likelihoods. SGEquiDiff consists of an SE(3)-invariant, telescoping
discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based
autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of
symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic
coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically
live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by
quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific
properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis,
energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion
principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance
constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process.
However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures
often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel
inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is
based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize
the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired
performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the
InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96%
improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models.
Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of
low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate
materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously
expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative
model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove
the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors
under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we
successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor
with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides
strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials
science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has
revolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often
struggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized
through kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between
theoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a
synthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure
derivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the
efficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable
structures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based
synthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized
structures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab
initio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The
framework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn,
Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting
synthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the
554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising
synthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X =
Ti, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$
candidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for
experimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally
observed temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a
data-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials
synthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational
predictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for
the targeted discovery of novel functional materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and
topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical
design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate
promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are
restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion
(BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D
all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding
crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database,
BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms
with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental
databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented
metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of
magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was
synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2
sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical
pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials
discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials
with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for
crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to
separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These
methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising,
which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we
introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that
jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline
materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices,
DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules,
enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and
lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic
symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it
to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied
DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high
saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable,
diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.</p>

Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units.

    <p>We present Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen), a diffusion-based
framework for crystal structure prediction. Unconditional generation with
diffusion models demonstrates limited efficacy in identifying symmetric
crystals as the unit cell size increases. CHGGen addresses this limitation
through conditional generation with the inpainting method, which optimizes a
fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host
structure. We demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical
systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric
structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen
extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures,
particularly for systems with partial occupancy, surface absorption and
defects. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other
generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials
discovery.</p>

scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are labour-intensive, subjective, and
time-consuming, limiting their scalability for high-throughput analysis. In
this study, we present an automated methodology integrating edge detection with
generative diffusion models to effectively identify grains, eliminate noise,
and connect broken segments in alignment with predicted grain boundaries. Due
to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep
machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate
synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data
approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is
a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average
grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from
low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced
and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs)
are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery
highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials,
particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations
of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on
the generation of new topological materials through a generative model.
Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained
generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material
design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's
ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of
the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a
large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a
representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the
largest known in this category.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a
profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and
the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase
transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport
measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light
of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic
interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using
first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron
correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization
in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry,
which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation
transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the
calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the
L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental
observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display
a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two
inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic
interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and
antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the
magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical
aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase
diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the
magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the
experimentally observed phase transformations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Solving black-box optimization problems with Ising machines is increasingly
common in materials science. However, their application to crystal structure
prediction (CSP) is still ineffective due to symmetry agnostic encoding of
atomic coordinates. We introduce CRYSIM, an algorithm that encodes the space
group, the Wyckoff positions combination, and coordinates of independent atomic
sites as separate variables. This encoding reduces the search space
substantially by exploiting the symmetry in space groups. When CRYSIM is
interfaced to Fixstars Amplify, a GPU-based Ising machine, its prediction
performance was competitive with CALYPSO and Bayesian optimization for crystals
containing more than 150 atoms in a unit cell. Although it is not realistic to
interface CRYSIM to current small-scale quantum devices, it has the potential
to become the standard CSP algorithm in the coming quantum age.</p>

    <p>Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to
account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process,
enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to
slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a
stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established
dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model
and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation
density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of
such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models
can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation
density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences
material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena,
we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian
crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based
CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale
materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical
devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</p>

    <p>Reinforcement fine-tuning has instrumental enhanced the instruction-following

applications of reinforcement fine-tuning to the autoregressive
transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer (arXiv:2403.15734)
using discriminative machine learning models such as interatomic potentials and
property prediction models. By optimizing reward signals-such as energy above
the convex hull and material property figures of merit-reinforcement
fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative
models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in
generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet
conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and
band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning
enables not only the property-guided novel material design ability of
generative pre-trained model but also unlocks property-driven material
retrieval from the unsupervised pre-training dataset. Leveraging rewards from
discriminative models to fine-tune materials generative models opens an
exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for

    <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific
research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system
sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on
reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for
solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In
this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework
based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly
updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by
traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various
systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid,
demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural,
dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows
for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps,
generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than
4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended
timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical
phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An
open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under

    <p>Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal
structures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic
simulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced
the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures
across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a
significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based
CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to
efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of
crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between
convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization.
Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware
random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials.
We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP
(PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT
calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal
structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal
NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in
materials discovery.</p>

    <p>Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial for efficient thermal
management in electronics and energy conversion technologies. Traditional
methods for predicting \k{appa}L are often computationally expensive, limiting
their scalability for large-scale material screening. Empirical models, such as
the Slack model, offer faster alternatives but require time-consuming
calculations for key parameters such as sound velocity and the Gruneisen
parameter. This work presents a high-throughput framework, physical-informed
kappa (PINK), which combines the predictive power of crystal graph
convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs) with the physical interpretability of
the Slack model to predict \k{appa}L directly from crystallographic information
files (CIFs). Unlike previous approaches, PINK enables rapid, batch predictions
by extracting material properties such as bulk and shear modulus from CIFs
using a well-trained CGCNN model. These properties are then used to compute the
necessary parameters for $\kappa_L$ calculation through a simplified physical
formula. PINK was applied to a dataset of 377,221 stable materials, enabling
the efficient identification of promising candidates with ultralow $\kappa_L$
values, such as Ag$_3$Te$_4$W and Ag$_3$Te$_4$Ta. The platform, accessible via

We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain

    <p>Accelerated materials discovery is an urgent demand to drive advancements in
fields such as energy conversion, storage, and catalysis. Property-directed
generative design has emerged as a transformative approach for rapidly
discovering new functional inorganic materials with multiple desired properties
within vast and complex search spaces. However, this approach faces two primary
challenges: data scarcity for functional properties and the multi-objective
optimization required to balance competing tasks. Here, we present a
multi-property-directed generative framework designed to overcome these

(translational) symmetry. By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data
augmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse
and small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials
simultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation
energy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically
and lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and
cubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their
thermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability
for thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions
have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding
through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical
role of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science,
these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods
remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction.
At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses
3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It
then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details,
capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in
microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance
efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression
strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a
masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token
positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these
strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single
autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D
GU tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its
effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous
state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to
256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x
faster. The code is publicly available at

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning has revolutionized the study of crystalline materials for
enabling rapid predictions and discovery. However, most AI-for-Materials
research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials
inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional
technologies. The defects and dopants break geometric symmetry and increase
interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models.
Addressing these challenges requires models that are able to capture sparse
defect-driven effects in crystals while maintaining adaptability and precision.
Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet),
a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions
and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. Trained on 14,866
defect structures, DefiNet achieves highly accurate structural predictions in a
single step, avoiding the time-consuming iterative processes in modern ML
relaxation models and possible error accumulation from iteration. We further
validates DefiNet's accuracy by using density functional theory (DFT)
relaxation on DefiNet-predicted structures. For most defect structures,
regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required
to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability
and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a groundbreaking tool
for defect-focused materials research.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of
electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the
anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio
evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under
pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O
structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above
900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an
instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$).
Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer
at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the
hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters
within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the
hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive
superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic
fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion
magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three
directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the
system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to
re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under
high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and
Neptune.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin
liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via
the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field
splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic
structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect
due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the
presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange
interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the
strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field
theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of
Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the
trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted
hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators,
resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively.
Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation
effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in
this and related materials.</p>

    <p>An excitonic insulator$^{1,2}$ (EI) is a correlated many-body state of
electron-hole pairs, potentially leading to high-temperature condensate and
superfluidity$^{3-7}$. Despite ever-growing experiments suggesting possible EI
states in various materials, direct proofs remain elusive and debated. Here we
address the problem by introducing an ab initio methodology, enabling the
parameter-free determination of electron-hole pairing order parameter and
single-particle excitations within a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type

is an unconventional EI with a transition temperature ~900K, breaking
spontaneously the crystal's inversion, rotation, and mirror symmetries, while
maintaining odd parity and unitarity. We identify several telltale
spectroscopic signatures emergent in this EI phase that distinguish it from the
band insulator (BI) phase, exemplified with a giant $\textbf{k}$-dependent
$\textit{p}$-wave spin texture.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal
structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering
novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as
proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored
area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this
paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address
CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary
foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy
prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that
our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all
metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in
generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and
energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's
performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors
($\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, $ \text{Zr}_{16}\text{Rh}_8\text{O}_4$ and
$\text{Zr}_{16}\text{Pd}_8\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to
analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature
predictions and structure generations. For instance, on
$\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the
experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with
high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast,
conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the
structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE
is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times
slower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our
approach for advancing materials science research and development.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g.,
materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches
primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models,
each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations.
Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to
multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like
VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their
direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high
precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other
hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data,
such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy.
Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as
general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we
propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token
prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the
strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional
diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision
of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on
material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in
state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and
establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure
prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX
demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences
for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for
scientific data generation.</p>

    <p>Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting

transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From
first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we
determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral
($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials
($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational
space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and
their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy
configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we
construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of
all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect
configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that
link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for
$\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the
Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors
D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both
$\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest
diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The
predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with
previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments,

    <p>Equivariant diffusion models have emerged as the prevailing approach for
generating novel crystal materials due to their ability to leverage the
physical symmetries of periodic material structures. However, current models do
not effectively learn the joint distribution of atom types, fractional
coordinates, and lattice structure of the crystal material in a cohesive
end-to-end diffusion framework. Also, none of these models work under realistic
setups, where users specify the desired characteristics that the generated
structures must match. In this work, we introduce TGDMat, a novel text-guided
diffusion model designed for 3D periodic material generation. Our approach
integrates global structural knowledge through textual descriptions at each
denoising step while jointly generating atom coordinates, types, and lattice
structure using a periodic-E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN).
Extensive experiments using popular datasets on benchmark tasks reveal that
TGDMat outperforms existing baseline methods by a good margin. Notably, for the
structure prediction task, with just one generated sample, TGDMat outperforms
all baseline models, highlighting the importance of text-guided diffusion.
Further, in the generation task, TGDMat surpasses all baselines and their
text-fusion variants, showcasing the effectiveness of the joint diffusion
paradigm. Additionally, incorporating textual knowledge reduces overall
training and sampling computational overhead while enhancing generative
performance when utilizing real-world textual prompts from experts.</p>

    <p>We consider the problem of crystal materials generation using language models
(LMs). A key step is to convert 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences to be
processed by LMs. Prior studies used the crystallographic information framework
(CIF) file stream, which fails to ensure SE(3) and periodic invariance and may
not lead to unique sequence representations for a given crystal structure.
Here, we propose a novel method, known as Mat2Seq, to tackle this challenge.
Mat2Seq converts 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences and ensures that
different mathematical descriptions of the same crystal are represented in a
single unique sequence, thereby provably achieving SE(3) and periodic

achieves promising performance in crystal structure generation as compared with

    <p>Crystal structure generation is fundamental to materials discovery, enabling

on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate

achieving a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic
potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability via quantum mechanical
calculations, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond
crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework can be
readily adapted to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure
prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation
energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish
pre-trained LLMs as versatile and effective tools for materials discovery,

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming materials science, enabling both
theoretical advancements and accelerated materials discovery. Recent progress
in crystal generation models, which design crystal structures for targeted
properties, and foundation atomic models (FAMs), which capture interatomic
interactions across the periodic table, has significantly improved inverse
materials design. However, an efficient integration of these two approaches
remains an open challenge. Here, we present an active learning framework that
combines crystal generation models and foundation atomic models to enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of inverse design. As a case study, we employ Con-CDVAE
to generate candidate crystal structures and MACE-MP-0 FAM as one of the
high-throughput screeners for bulk modulus evaluation. Through iterative active
learning, we demonstrate that Con-CDVAE progressively improves its accuracy in
generating crystals with target properties, highlighting the effectiveness of a
property-driven fine-tuning process. Our framework is general to accommodate
different crystal generation and foundation atomic models, and establishes a
scalable approach for AI-driven materials discovery. By bridging generative
modeling with atomic-scale simulations, this work paves the way for more
accurate and efficient inverse materials design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>As with many parts of the natural sciences, machine learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the modeling of molecular crystals.
However, challenges remain for the accurate and efficient calculation of
sublimation enthalpies - a key thermodynamic quantity measuring the stability
of a molecular crystal. Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the
need for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate
training data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional
theory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent
developments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science
alongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising
path forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of
describing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with
sub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\sim 200$ data structures; an order of
magnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this
framework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting
for anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy
with respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be
generalized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and
aspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the
case of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this
work paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological
systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte
lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical
energy density and improved safety. However, their adoption is currently
hindered by their lower effective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs
charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using
conventional theoretical calculations and experimental validation is both
time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise
to expedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is
scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a domain-expert-curated database of $\sim$600
synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room
temperature ionic conductivities gathered from literature. Each material is
described by their measured composition, space group and lattice parameters. A
full-crystal description in the form of a crystallographic information file
(CIF) is provided for ~320 structures for which atomic positions were
available. We discuss various statistics and features of the dataset and
provide training and testing splits that avoid data leakage. Finally, we
benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity
and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facilitate the use
of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery.</p>

    <p>To retrieve and compare scientific data of simulations and experiments in
materials science, data needs to be easily accessible and machine readable to
qualify and quantify various materials science phenomena. The recent progress
in open science leverages the accessibility to data. However, a majority of
information is encoded within scientific documents limiting the capability of
finding suitable literature as well as material properties. This manuscript
showcases an automated workflow, which unravels the encoded information from
scientific literature to a machine readable data structure of texts, figures,
tables, equations and meta-data, using natural language processing and language
as well as vision transformer models to generate a machine-readable database.
The machine-readable database can be enriched with local data, as e.g.
unpublished or private material data, leading to knowledge synthesis. The study
shows that such an automated workflow accelerates information retrieval,
proximate context detection and material property extraction from multi-modal
input data exemplarily shown for the research field of microstructural analyses
of face-centered cubic single crystals. Ultimately, a Retrieval-Augmented

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th
century, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the
microscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures
and phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the
need for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of
complex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first
algorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to
computational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family
of differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics --
and assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall
diversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis
at scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine
learning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein
universe, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that
AlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute
most to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database
led to similar findings: more than $85\%$ of the crystals with formation energy
data are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance
diversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as
memorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized
training samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the
best-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least
to diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a
powerful tool for data-driven science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>With the rapid development of energy storage technology, high-performance
solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have become critical for next-generation
lithium-ion batteries. These materials require high ionic conductivity,
excellent electrochemical stability, and good mechanical properties to meet the
demands of electric vehicles and portable electronics. However, traditional
methods like density functional theory (DFT) and empirical force fields face
challenges such as high computational costs, poor scalability, and limited
accuracy across material systems. Universal machine learning interatomic
potentials (uMLIPs) offer a promising solution with their efficiency and
near-DFT-level accuracy.This study systematically evaluates six advanced uMLIP
models (MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, CHGNet, M3GNet, and ORBFF) in terms of
energy, forces, thermodynamic properties, elastic moduli, and lithium-ion
diffusion behavior. The results show that MatterSim outperforms others in
nearly all metrics, particularly in complex material systems, demonstrating
superior accuracy and physical consistency. Other models exhibit significant
deviations due to issues like energy inconsistency or insufficient training
data coverage.Further analysis reveals that MatterSim achieves excellent
agreement with reference values in lithium-ion diffusivity calculations,
especially at room temperature. Studies on Li3YCl6 and Li6PS5Cl uncover how
crystal structure, anion disorder levels, and Na/Li arrangements influence
ionic conductivity. Appropriate S/Cl disorder levels and optimized Na/Li
arrangements enhance diffusion pathway connectivity, improving overall ionic
transport performance.</p>

    <p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks.

    <p>Crystal structure forms the foundation for understanding the physical and
chemical properties of materials. Generative models have emerged as a new
paradigm in crystal structure prediction(CSP), however, accurately capturing
key characteristics of crystal structures, such as periodicity and symmetry,
remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Crystal Structure Prediction
(TransVAE-CSP), who learns the characteristic distribution space of stable
materials, enabling both the reconstruction and generation of crystal
structures. TransVAE-CSP integrates adaptive distance expansion with
irreducible representation to effectively capture the periodicity and symmetry
of crystal structures, and the encoder is a transformer network based on an
equivariant dot product attention mechanism. Experimental results on the
carbon_24, perov_5, and mp_20 datasets demonstrate that TransVAE-CSP
outperforms existing methods in structure reconstruction and generation tasks
under various modeling metrics, offering a powerful tool for crystal structure
design and optimization.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recent advancements in AI have revolutionized property prediction in
materials science and accelerating material discovery. Graph neural networks
(GNNs) stand out due to their ability to represent crystal structures as
graphs, effectively capturing local interactions and delivering superior
predictions. However, these methods often lose critical global information,
such as crystal systems and repetitive unit connectivity. To address this, we
propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal fusion model that integrates
graph and text modalities to preserve essential material information. CAST
combines node- and token-level features using cross-attention mechanisms,
surpassing previous approaches reliant on material-level embeddings like graph
mean-pooling or [CLS] tokens. A masked node prediction pretraining strategy
further enhances atomic-level information integration. Our method achieved up
to 22.9\% improvement in property prediction across four crystal properties
including band gap compared to methods like CrysMMNet and MultiMat. Pretraining
was key to aligning node and text embeddings, with attention maps confirming
its effectiveness in capturing relationships between nodes and tokens. This
study highlights the potential of multimodal learning in materials science,
paving the way for more robust predictive models that incorporate both local

    <p>Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to
advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The
defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central
role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal
generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the
symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information
from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a
novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates
crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals
into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1)
the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the
whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry
transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We
also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations,
enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We
showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials
Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and

    <p>The discovery of new crystalline materials is essential to scientific and
technological progress. However, traditional trial-and-error approaches are
inefficient due to the vast search space. Recent advancements in machine
learning have enabled generative models to predict new stable materials by
incorporating structural symmetries and to condition the generation on desired
properties. In this work, we introduce SymmBFN, a novel symmetry-aware Bayesian
Flow Network (BFN) for crystalline material generation that accurately
reproduces the distribution of space groups found in experimentally observed
crystals. SymmBFN substantially improves efficiency, generating stable
structures at least 50 times faster than the next-best method. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its capability for property-conditioned generation, enabling the
design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings establish BFNs as an
effective tool for accelerating the discovery of crystalline materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Diamond, the hardest natural crystal, has attracted significant attention for
its plasticity, which is reported to be determined by its stacking faults.
Studies mainly focused on one-dimensional linear pathways in stacking
transitions, neglecting its transverse freedom on the main slip plane. However,
in an actual stacking procedure, stacking faults can follow curve line along
the slip plane rather than constrained to straight lines. In this study, using
ab initio calculations, we mapped the {\gamma}-surface, defined as the
landscape of generalized stacking fault energies, along the weakest direction
of the {111} orientation in diamond. We then applied the Nudged Elastic Band
(NEB) method to determine the minimum energy paths, finding significantly
reduced stacking energy barriers compared to previous reports (for the
glide-set, our energy barrier is only one-third of that for the traditional
direct path). Our calculations reveal that the glide-set can round its
high-energy peak, with a lower energy barrier within the entire stacking plane
than the shuffle-set. By employing the NEB method, we have constructed the
minimum energy path (MEP) for both the stacking and dislocation procedures. Our
results provide new insights into the plasticity and stacking faults of
diamond, advancing the understanding of superhard carbon material transition,
especially the diamond under shear stress.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological
advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must
effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite
design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMG), a unifying
framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline
materials. OMG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base
distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class
of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow
matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by
integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and
extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell
representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates
and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We
benchmark OMG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)
for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering
stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMG,
we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMG
establishes a new state-of-the-art in generative modeling for materials
discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.
These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning
frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative modeling of crystal data distribution is an important yet
challenging task due to the unique periodic physical symmetry of crystals.
Diffusion-based methods have shown early promise in modeling crystal
distribution. More recently, Bayesian Flow Networks were introduced to
aggregate noisy latent variables, resulting in a variance-reduced parameter
space that has been shown to be advantageous for modeling Euclidean data
distributions with structural constraints (Song et al., 2023). Inspired by
this, we seek to unlock its potential for modeling variables located in
non-Euclidean manifolds e.g. those within crystal structures, by overcoming
challenging theoretical issues. We introduce CrysBFN, a novel crystal
generation method by proposing a periodic Bayesian flow, which essentially
differs from the original Gaussian-based BFN by exhibiting non-monotonic
entropy dynamics. To successfully realize the concept of periodic Bayesian
flow, CrysBFN integrates a new entropy conditioning mechanism and empirically
demonstrates its significance compared to time-conditioning. Extensive
experiments over both crystal ab initio generation and crystal structure
prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of CrysBFN, which consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art on all benchmarks. Surprisingly, we found that
CrysBFN enjoys a significant improvement in sampling efficiency, e.g., ~100x
speedup 10 v.s. 2000 steps network forwards) compared with previous
diffusion-based methods on MP-20 dataset. Code is available at

    <p>Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet
challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this
process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding
spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties
and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are
human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast
materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training
(CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces
between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings
that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between
crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via
user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of
sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP
leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and
corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for
training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal
structure screening and embedding space visualization.</p>

    <p>Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically
stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central
challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a
diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel
crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density
functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates,
atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian
manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion
process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an
equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and
translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates
the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their
ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling
conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group.
These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by
offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental

    <p>Increasing photovoltaic conversion efficiency, or PCE, has proven to be a
critical factor in the transition to renewable energy. There exist strong
interdependencies between the perovskite crystals and multijunction
architectures within photovoltaic cell research. In present literature, there
is a lack of intersection in investigating crystallographic geometry and
compositional engineering with representation of computational modeling
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the rapid discovery of
high-efficiency perovskite-based multijunction cells, specifically with silicon
as the low band gap absorbing semiconductor material. We model the spatial
geometries of potential perovskite candidates for high-efficiency cells using
the Schrodinger Material Science Maestro, optimizing the periodic boundary
conditions on the unit cell to minimize edge-bound errors. Band structure
calculations using density functional theory become effective to approximate
the PCE. After careful adjustments to the ibrav lattice parameter and
parallelization, Quantum ESPRESSO was optimized for perovskite multijunction
band structure calculations. Computational results on the six test-perovskite
configurations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed
representation and method, with a calculated efficiency of about 46% for one of
the modeled perovskites, placing it at the top of high-efficiency perovskite-Si
multijunction cells. With this method, the potential exists to bring forth a
new generation of photovoltaic cells that are easily manufacturable, highly
efficient, and economical.</p>

    <p>We review the recent development of machine-learning (ML) force-field
frameworks for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics simulations of itinerant
electron magnets, focusing on the general theory and implementations of
symmetry-invariant representations of spin configurations. The crucial
properties that such magnetic descriptors must satisfy are differentiability
with respect to spin rotations and invariance to both lattice point-group
symmetry and internal spin rotation symmetry. We propose an efficient
implementation based on the concept of reference irreducible representations,
modified from the group-theoretical power-spectrum and bispectrum methods. The
ML framework is demonstrated using the s-d models, which are widely applied in
spintronics research. We show that LLG simulations based on local fields
predicted by the trained ML models successfully reproduce representative
non-collinear spin structures, including 120$^\circ$, tetrahedral, and skyrmion
crystal orders of the triangular-lattice s-d models. Large-scale thermal quench
simulations enabled by ML models further reveal intriguing freezing dynamics
and glassy stripe states consisting of skyrmions and bi-merons. Our work

    <p>The original theory of phonon polariton is Huang's equation which is suitable
for diatomic polar crystals only. We proposed a generalized Huang's equation
without fitting parameters for phonon polariton in polyatomic polar crystals.
We obtained the dispersions of phonon polariton in GaP (bulk), hBN (bulk and
2D), {\alpha}-MoO3 (bulk and 2D) and ZnTeMoO6 (2D), which agree with the
experimental results in the literature and of ourselves. We also obtained the
eigenstates of the phonon polariton. We found that the circular polarization of
the ion vibration component of these eigenstates is nonzero in hBN flakes. The
result is different from that of the phonon in hBN.</p>

    <p>Generative models generate vast numbers of hypothetical materials,
necessitating fast, accurate models for property prediction. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) excel in this domain but face challenges like high training
costs, domain adaptation issues, and over-smoothing. We introduce DenseGNN,
which employs Dense Connectivity Network (DCN), Hierarchical Node-Edge-Graph
Residual Networks (HRN), and Local Structure Order Parameters Embedding (LOPE)
to address these challenges. DenseGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets such as JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and QM9, improving the
performance of models like GIN, Schnet, and Hamnet on materials datasets. By
optimizing atomic embeddings and reducing computational costs, DenseGNN enables
deeper architectures and surpasses other GNNs in crystal structure distinction,

work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration

ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although
many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast,
generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when
sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties
such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability

structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained
machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This
low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates
of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Graph neural network universal interatomic potentials (GNN-UIPs) have
demonstrated remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities in material
discovery and property prediction. These models can accelerate molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation by several orders of magnitude while maintaining
\textit{ab initio} accuracy, making them a promising new paradigm in material
simulations. One notable example is Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network
(CHGNet), pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments
from the MPtrj dataset, representing a state-of-the-art GNN-UIP model for
charge-informed MD simulations. However, training the CHGNet model is
time-consuming(8.3 days on one A100 GPU) for three reasons: (i) requiring
multi-layer propagation to reach more distant atom information, (ii) requiring
second-order derivatives calculation to finish weights updating and (iii) the
implementation of reference CHGNet does not fully leverage the computational
capabilities. This paper introduces FastCHGNet, an optimized CHGNet, with three
contributions: Firstly, we design innovative Force/Stress Readout modules to
decompose Force/Stress prediction. Secondly, we adopt massive optimizations
such as kernel fusion, redundancy bypass, etc, to exploit GPU computation power
sufficiently. Finally, we extend CHGNet to support multiple GPUs and propose a
load-balancing technique to enhance GPU utilization. Numerical results show
that FastCHGNet reduces memory footprint by a factor of 3.59. The final
training time of FastCHGNet can be decreased to \textbf{1.53 hours} on 32 GPUs
without sacrificing model accuracy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative model for 2D materials has shown significant promise in
accelerating the material discovery process. The stability and performance of
these materials are strongly influenced by their underlying symmetry. However,
existing generative models for 2D materials often neglect symmetry constraints,
which limits both the diversity and quality of the generated structures. Here,
we introduce a symmetry-constrained diffusion model (SCDM) that integrates
space group symmetry into the generative process. By incorporating Wyckoff
positions, the model ensures adherence to symmetry principles, leading to the
generation of 2,000 candidate structures. DFT calculations were conducted to
evaluate the convex hull energies of these structures after structural
relaxation. From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy
stability criteria (Ehull < 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six
candidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band
structure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which
exhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a
symmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure
prediction model. The results highlight that incorporating symmetry constraints
enhances the effectiveness of generated 2D materials, making a contribution to
the discovery of 2D materials through generative modeling.</p>

    <p>Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for
modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples,
offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration

flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of
crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to
model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are
trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate
choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant
neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of
crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables
high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and
exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing
structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material
properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic
crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient
framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and
surface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically
exhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these
traces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it
generally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT)
model that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive
and quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be
harnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of
synthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large
span of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with
it. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally
output the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route
step by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most
instructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met
unexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the
NN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and
augmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra
efforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to
the sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials
substrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to
rationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.</p>

    <p>Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next-generation
piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to
engineer tailor-made solid-state assemblies. Using crystal engineering
principles, and techniques such as co-crystallisation, these materials can be
engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials
that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X-Ray Diffraction,
computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical
properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and
identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our
database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT)
predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT
(https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of
electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular,
the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal d33
constant. This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for
several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence
of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal
piezoelectricity to date.</p>

    <p>Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of
amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune

simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much
stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the
mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across
a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable
parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our
formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter
changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Material discovery is a cornerstone of modern science, driving advancements
in diverse disciplines from biomedical technology to climate solutions.
Predicting synthesizability, a critical factor in realizing novel materials,
remains a complex challenge due to the limitations of traditional heuristics
and thermodynamic proxies. While stability metrics such as formation energy
offer partial insights, they fail to account for kinetic factors and
technological constraints that influence synthesis outcomes. These challenges
are further compounded by the scarcity of negative data, as failed synthesis
attempts are often unpublished or context-specific.
  We present SynCoTrain, a semi-supervised machine learning model designed to
predict the synthesizability of materials. SynCoTrain employs a co-training
framework leveraging two complementary graph convolutional neural networks:
SchNet and ALIGNN. By iteratively exchanging predictions between classifiers,
SynCoTrain mitigates model bias and enhances generalizability. Our approach
uses Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning to address the absence of explicit
negative data, iteratively refining predictions through collaborative learning.
  The model demonstrates robust performance, achieving high recall on internal
and leave-out test sets. By focusing on oxide crystals, a well-characterized
material family with extensive experimental data, we establish SynCoTrain as a
reliable tool for predicting synthesizability while balancing dataset
variability and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of
co-training to advance high-throughput materials discovery and generative
research, offering a scalable solution to the challenge of synthesizability
prediction.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new
energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances
in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal
structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling
without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to
identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties.
In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes
multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures
with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate
constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated
by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which
considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a
subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation
process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a
probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of
existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals
strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of
supply chain during production.</p>

    <p>The discovery of new materials is very important to the field of materials
science. When researchers explore new materials, they often have expected
performance requirements for their crystal structure. In recent years,
data-driven methods have made great progress in the direction plane of crystal
structure generation, but there is still a lack of methods that can effectively
map material properties to crystal structure. In this paper, we propose a
Crystal DiT model to generate the crystal structure from the expected material

    <p>Machine learning has become a crucial tool for predicting the properties of
crystalline materials. However, existing methods primarily represent material
information by constructing multi-edge graphs of crystal structures, often
overlooking the chemical and physical properties of elements (such as atomic
radius, electronegativity, melting point, and ionization energy), which have a
significant impact on material performance. To address this limitation, we
first constructed an element property knowledge graph and utilized an embedding
model to encode the element attributes within the knowledge graph. Furthermore,
we propose a multimodal fusion framework, ESNet, which integrates element
property features with crystal structure features to generate joint multimodal
representations. This provides a more comprehensive perspective for predicting
the performance of crystalline materials, enabling the model to consider both
microstructural composition and chemical characteristics of the materials. We
conducted experiments on the Materials Project benchmark dataset, which showed
leading performance in the bandgap prediction task and achieved results on a
par with existing benchmarks in the formation energy prediction task.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Discovering new solid-state materials requires rapidly exploring the vast
space of crystal structures and locating stable regions. Generating stable
materials with desired properties and compositions is extremely difficult as we
search for very small isolated pockets in the exponentially many possibilities,
considering elements from the periodic table and their 3D arrangements in
crystal lattices. Materials discovery necessitates both optimized solution
structures and diversity in the generated material structures. Existing methods
struggle to explore large material spaces and generate diverse samples with
desired properties and requirements. We propose the Symmetry-aware Hierarchical
Architecture for Flow-based Traversal (SHAFT), a novel generative model
employing a hierarchical exploration strategy to efficiently exploit the
symmetry of the materials space to generate crystal structures given desired
properties. In particular, our model decomposes the exponentially large
materials space into a hierarchy of subspaces consisting of symmetric space
groups, lattice parameters, and atoms. We demonstrate that SHAFT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art iterative generative methods, such as Generative
Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoders
(CDVAE), in crystal structure generation tasks, achieving higher validity,
diversity, and stability of generated structures optimized for target

    <p>For a very long time, computational approaches to the design of new materials
have relied on an iterative process of finding a candidate material and
modeling its properties. AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping
to accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and
structures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven
approaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the
process of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches
to the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse
problem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without
utilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1)
conditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an
arbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most
energetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2)
conditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that
includes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types,
chemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss
function was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of
crystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching,
usual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches.
As a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare
target structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our
modifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy
41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency,
inference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new
structures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine-learning interatomic potential models based on graph neural network
architectures have the potential to make atomistic materials modeling widely
accessible due to their computational efficiency, scalability, and broad
applicability. The training datasets for many such models are derived from
density-functional theory calculations, typically using a semilocal
exchange-correlation functional. As a result, long-range interactions such as
London dispersion are often missing in these models. We investigate whether
this missing component can be addressed by combining a graph deep learning
potential with semiempirical dispersion models. We assess this combination by
deriving the equations of state for layered pnictogen chalcohalides BiTeBr and
BiTeI and performing crystal structure optimizations for a broader set of
V-VI-VII compounds with various stoichiometries, many of which possess van der
Waals gaps. We characterize the optimized crystal structures by calculating
their X-ray diffraction patterns and radial distribution function histograms,
which are also used to compute Earth mover's distances to quantify the
dissimilarity between the optimized and corresponding experimental structures.
We find that dispersion-corrected graph deep learning potentials generally
(though not universally) provide a more realistic description of these
compounds due to the inclusion of van der Waals attractions. In particular,
their use results in systematic improvements in predicting not only the van der
Waals gap but also the layer thickness in layered V-VI-VII compounds. Our
results demonstrate that the combined potentials studied here, derived from a
straightforward approach that neither requires fine-tuning the training nor
refitting the potential parameters, can significantly improve the description
of layered polar crystals.</p>

    <p>Material discovery is a critical area of research with the potential to
revolutionize various fields, including carbon capture, renewable energy, and
electronics. However, the immense scale of the chemical space makes it
challenging to explore all possible materials experimentally. In this paper, we
introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models
(LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline
materials. FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base
distribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting
to a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and
iteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation
rate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for
stable, unique, and novel crystals by $\sim50\%$ - a huge improvement on a
difficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much
closer to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model,
significantly reducing post-hoc computational cost.</p>

    <p>In recent years, the realm of crystalline materials has witnessed a surge in
the development of generative models, predominantly aimed at the inverse design
of crystals with tailored physical properties. However, spatial symmetry, which
serves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the
design process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry,
potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional
materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of
SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and
generation have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and
robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES.
Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we
have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical
properties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore
autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot
learning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of
computational materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Meso-scale calculations of pore collapse and hotspot formation in energetic
crystals provide closure models to macro-scale hydrocodes for predicting the
shock sensitivity of energetic materials. To this end, previous works obtained
atomistics-consistent material models for two common energetic crystals, HMX
and RDX, such that pore collapse calculations adhered closely to molecular
dynamics (MD) results on key features of energy localization, particularly the
profiles of the collapsing pores, appearance of shear bands, and the transition
from viscoplastic to hydrodynamic collapse. However, some important aspects
such as the temperature distributions in the hotspot were not as well captured.
One potential issue was noted but not resolved adequately in those works,
namely the grid resolution that should be employed in the meso-scale
calculations for various pore sizes and shock strengths. Conventional
computational mechanics guidelines for selecting meshes as fine as possible,
balancing computational effort, accuracy and grid independence, were shown not
to produce physically consistent features associated with shear localization.
Here, we examine the physics of pore collapse, shear band evolution and
structure, and hotspot formation, for both HMX and RDX; we then evaluate under
what conditions atomistics-consistent models yield physically correct
(considering MD as ground truth) hotspots for a range of pore diameters, from
nm to microns, and for a wide range of shock strengths. The study provides
insights into the effects of pore size and shock strength on pore collapse and
hotspots, identifying aspects such as size-independent behaviors, and
proportion of energy contained in shear as opposed to jet impact-heated regions
of the hotspot. Areas for further improvement of atomistics-consistent material
models are also indicated.</p>

raises accuracy from under 40% with pretrained models, to under 80% using
conventional fine-tuning, and further to around 90% with our proposed
generalized Tanimoto similarity, while maintaining robust to additional
synthesis steps. Our model further demonstrates comparable performance across
materials with varying degrees of quantumness quantified using quantum weight,
indicating that LLMs offer a powerful tool to predict balanced chemical

    <p>MXenes are a large family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and
nitrides that possess excellent electrical conductivity, high volumetric
capacitance, great mechanical properties, and hydrophilicity. In this work, we
generalize the concept of multihyperuniformity (MH), an exotic state that can
exist in a disordered multi-component system, to two-dimensional materials
MXenes. Disordered hyperuniform systems possess an isotropic local structure
that lacks traditional translational and orientational order, yet they
completely suppress infinite-wavelength density fluctuations as in perfect
crystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range order. In particular,
we evaluate the static structure factor of the individual components present in
the high entropy (HE) MXene experimental sample TiVCMoCr based on high-solution
SEM imaging data, which suggests this HE MXene system is at least effectively
multihyperuniform. We then devise a packing algorithm to generate
multihyperuniform models of HE MXene systems. The MH HE MXenes are predicted to
be energetically more stable compared to the prevailing (quasi)random models of
the HE MXenes due to the hidden long-range order. Moreover, the MH structure
exhibits a distinctly smaller lattice distortion, which has a vital effect on
the electronic properties of HE MXenes, such as the density of states and
charge distribution. This systematic study of HE MXenes strengthens our
fundamental understanding of these systems, and suggests possible exotic
physical properties, as endowed by the multihyperuniformity.</p>

    <p>The shape of nanocrystals is crucial in determining their surface area,
reactivity, optical properties, mechanical strength, and self-assembly
behavior. Traditionally, shape control has been achieved through empirical
methods, highlighting the need for a more refined theoretical framework. A
comprehensive model should account for the kinetic factors at distinct stages
of the shape-formation process to identify the key determinants of nanocrystal
morphology. By modulating kinetics at terraces, ledges, and kinks, we reveal
that the primary factors are the adatom nucleation energies and the geometry of
growth islands. Transient sites dominate the growth process, leading to
kinetically trapped, metastable shapes. We illustrate these concepts with
face-centered cubic nanocrystals, demonstrating diverse shape evolutions,
including surface roughening and the preservation of crystal symmetry in cubes,
octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and their truncated variants. This study
reveals the mechanisms driving the formation of cubic nanocrystal shapes and
offers guidance for their precise synthesis.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials
design by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained
property predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is
hindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such
as charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local
minima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these
issues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive
Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and
template-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid
poor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without
retraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional
targets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal
systems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced
with gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five
target properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and
Bayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite
structures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at
which the other methods fail entirely.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In materials science, finding crystal structures that have targeted
properties is crucial. While recent methodologies such as Bayesian optimization
and deep generative models have made some advances on this issue, these methods
often face difficulties in adaptively incorporating various constraints, such
as electrical neutrality and targeted properties optimization, while keeping
the desired specific crystal structure. To address these challenges, we have
developed the Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal
Synthesizer (SMOACS), which utilizes state-of-the-art property prediction
models and their gradients to directly optimize input crystal structures for
targeted properties simultaneously. SMOACS enables the integration of adaptive
constraints into the optimization process without necessitating model
retraining. Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously
optimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even
with models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap
optimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining
electrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites,
where the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging. The
properties of the most promising materials have been confirmed by density
functional theory calculations.</p>

    <p>Despite an artificial intelligence-assisted modeling of disordered crystals

its robustness, reliability, and stability are still not resolved and even not

machine learning models on them correspondingly. Our qualitative and, what is
more important, quantitative assessment of the difference in the predictions
clearly shows that different reasonable changes in the training sample can lead
to the completely different set of the predicted potentially new materials. We
also showed the advantage of pre-training and proposed a simple yet effective
trick of sequential training to increase stability.</p>

allow the inverse design of materials, i.e., assessing the

    <p>The electronic structure and the band gap behavior of

calculated band gap sizes for the CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$ series
were found to be similar to the experimentally measured values. While the
change of the optimized lattice parameter with an increasing Br content can be
described by a linear fit, the calculated band gap variation exhibits rather a
quadratic-like behavior over the $x$ region of the cubic crystal structure.
While the experimental reports are divided on whether the bowing parameter

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice
structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional
atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building
blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and
strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$.
Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and
fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and
large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic
band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band
edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the
acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption
enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively,
while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can
separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally,
the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more
than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing
spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work
provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of
fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A new method is presented to generate atomic structures that reproduce the
essential characteristics of arbitrary material systems, phases, or ensembles.
Previous methods allow one to reproduce the essential characteristics (e.g.
chemical disorder) of a large random alloy within a small crystal structure.
The ability to generate small representations of random alloys, with the
restriction to crystal systems, results from using the fixed-lattice cluster
correlations to describe structural characteristics. A more general description
of the structural characteristics of atomic systems is obtained using complete
sets of atomic environment descriptors. These are used within for generating
representative atomic structures without restriction to fixed lattices. A
general data-driven approach is provided utilizing the atomic cluster
expansion(ACE) basis. The N-body ACE descriptors are a complete set of atomic
environment descriptors that span both chemical and spatial degrees of freedom
and are used within for describing atomic structures. The generalized
representative structure(GRS) method presented within generates small atomic
structures that reproduce ACE descriptor distributions corresponding to
arbitrary structural and chemical complexity. It is shown that systematically
improvable representations of crystalline systems on fixed parent lattices,
amorphous materials, liquids, and ensembles of atomic structures may be
produced efficiently through optimization algorithms. We highlight reduced
representations of atomistic machine-learning training datasets that contain
similar amounts of information and small 40-72 atom representations of liquid
phases. The ability to use GRS methodology as a driver for informed novel
structure generation is also demonstrated. The advantages over other
data-driven methods and state-of-the-art methods restricted to high-symmetry
systems are highlighted.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning
workhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields
such as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures.
Multicomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can
exhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a
variety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to
fully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability,
strength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on
orderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure
GCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the
ordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we
benchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the
ordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made
dataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional
symmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference
between the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same
material, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently
preserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various
orderings.</p>

    <p>We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating

unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural

speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of
free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also
modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid

    <p>Most of the novel energy materials contain multiple elements occupying a
single site in their lattice. The exceedingly large configurational space of
these materials imposes challenges in determining their ground-state
structures. Coulomb energies of possible configurations generally show a
satisfactory correlation to computed energies at higher levels of theory and
thus allow to screen for minimum-energy structures. Employing a second-order
cluster expansion, we obtain an efficient Coulomb energy optimizer using Monte
Carlo and Genetic Algorithms. The presented optimization package, GOAC (Global
Optimization of Atomistic Configurations by Coulomb), can achieve a speed up of
several orders of magnitude compared to existing software. Our code is able to
find low-energy configurations of complex systems involving up to $10^{920}$
structural configurations. The GOAC package thus provides an efficient method

    <p>Generative models trained at scale can now produce text, video, and more
recently, scientific data such as crystal structures. In applications of
generative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal
structures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level
instructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate
crystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate
end-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization
problem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for
controllable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language
model that takes high-level natural language as input and generates
intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and
(2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and
generates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally
uses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from
the generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three
components to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible
structures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of
directly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user
request and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able
to generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels,
solely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more
complex structure generation in near future.</p>

    <p>Numerical modeling of polycrystal plasticity is computationally intensive. We
employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries
for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We
present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge
distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and
combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress
tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh
graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created
between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with
complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity
theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for
both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach
speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also
apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN
generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts
the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and
generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions
demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations

    <p>Application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been ubiquitous in the growth
of research in the areas of basic sciences. Frequent use of machine learning
(ML) and deep learning (DL) based methodologies by researchers has resulted in
significant advancements in the last decade. These techniques led to notable
performance enhancements in different tasks such as protein structure
prediction, drug-target binding affinity prediction, and molecular property
prediction. In material science literature, it is well-known that crystalline
materials exhibit topological structures. Such topological structures may be
represented as graphs and utilization of graph neural network (GNN) based
approaches could help encoding them into an augmented representation space.
Primarily, such frameworks adopt supervised learning techniques targeted
towards downstream property prediction tasks on the basis of electronic
properties (formation energy, bandgap, total energy, etc.) and crystalline
structures. Generally, such type of frameworks rely highly on the handcrafted
atom feature representations along with the structural representations. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised framework namely, CrysAtom, using untagged
crystal data to generate dense vector representation of atoms, which can be
utilized in existing GNN-based property predictor models to accurately predict
important properties of crystals. Empirical results show that our dense

Here we use density-functional theory calculations, mass approximation, and the
Raman intensity weighted $\Gamma$-point density of state approach to analyze
Raman scattering and vibrational modes in zincblende, wurtzite, and hexagonal
BX (X = N, P, and As) structures. The influence of crystal structure and boron
isotope disorder on Raman line shapes is examined. Our results demonstrate that
long-range Coulomb interactions significantly influence the evolution of Raman
spectra in cubic and wurtzite BN compounds. With the evolution of the
compositional rate from $^{11}$B to $^{10}$B, a shift toward higher
frequencies, as well as the maximum broadening and asymmetry of the Raman
peaks, is expected around the 1:1 ratio. The calculated results are in
excellent agreement with the available experimental data. This study serves as
a guide for understanding how crystal symmetry and isotope disorder affect
phonons in BX compounds, which are relevant to quantum single-photon emitters,
heat management, and crystal quality assessments.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The crystal structure can be simplified as a periodic point set repeating
across the entire three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice.
Traditionally, methods for representing crystals rely on descriptors like
lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups to characterize the structure.
However, in reality, atoms in material always vibrate above absolute zero,
causing continuous fluctuations in their positions. This dynamic behavior
disrupts the underlying periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based
on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under
even slight perturbations. To this end, chemists proposed the Pairwise Distance
Distribution (PDD) method, which has been used to distinguish all periodic
structures in the world's largest real materials collection, the Cambridge
Structural Database. However, achieving the completeness of PDD requires
defining a large number of neighboring atoms, resulting in high computational
costs. Moreover, it does not account for atomic information, making it
challenging to directly apply PDD to crystal material property prediction
tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the atom-Weighted Pairwise
Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution
(UPDD) for the first time, incorporating them into the construction of
multi-edge crystal graphs. Based on this, we further developed WPDDFormer and
UPDDFormer, graph transformer architecture constructed using WPDD and UPDD
crystal graphs. We demonstrate that this method maintains the continuity and
completeness of crystal graphs even under slight perturbations in atomic
positions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In a recent class of phase field crystal (PFC) models, the density order
parameter is coupled to powers of its mean field. This effectively introduces a
phenomenology of higher-order direct correlation functions acting on long
wavelengths, which is required for modelling solid-liquid-vapor systems. The
present work generalizes these models by incorporating, into a single-field
theory, higher-order direct correlations, systematically constructed in
reciprocal space to operate across long {\it and} short wavelengths. The
correlation kernels introduced are also readily adaptable to describe distinct
crystal structures. We examine the three-phase equilibrium properties and phase
diagrams of the proposed model, and reproduce parts of the aluminum phase
diagram as an example of its versatile parametrization. We assess the dynamics
of the model, showing that it allows robust control of the interface energy
between the vapor and condensed phases (liquid and solid). We also examine the
dynamics of solid-vapor interfaces over a wide range of parameters and find
that dynamical artifacts reported in previous PFC models do not occur in the
present formalism. Additionally, we demonstrate the capacity of the proposed
formalism for computing complex microstructures and defects such as
dislocations, grain boundaries, and voids in solid-liquid-vapor systems, all of
which are expected to be crucial for investigating rapid solidification
processes.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The accurate prediction of material properties is crucial in a wide range of
scientific and engineering disciplines. Machine learning (ML) has advanced the
state of the art in this field, enabling scientists to discover novel materials
and design materials with specific desired properties. However, one major
challenge that persists in material property prediction is the generalization
of models to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples,i.e., samples that differ
significantly from those encountered during training. In this paper, we explore
the application of advancements in OOD learning approaches to enhance the
robustness and reliability of material property prediction models. We propose
and apply the Crystal Adversarial Learning (CAL) algorithm for OOD materials
property prediction,which generates synthetic data during training to bias the
training towards those samples with high prediction uncertainty. We further
propose an adversarial learning based targeting finetuning approach to make the
model adapted to a particular OOD dataset, as an alternative to traditional
fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate the success of our CAL algorithm with
its high effectiveness in ML with limited samples which commonly occurs in
materials science. Our work represents a promising direction toward better OOD
learning and materials property prediction.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties represents a
formidable challenge in materials science. Although recent generative models
have demonstrated potential, their adoption has been hindered by limitations
such as inefficiency, architectural constraints and restricted open-source
availability. The representation of crystal structures using the SLICES
(Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) notation as a string of
characters enables the use of state-of-the-art natural language processing
models, such as Transformers, for crystal design. Drawing inspiration from the
success of GPT models in generating coherent text, we trained a generative
Transformer on the next-token prediction task to generate solid-state materials
with targeted properties. We demonstrate MatterGPT's capability to generate de
novo crystal structures with targeted single properties, including both
lattice-insensitive (formation energy) and lattice-sensitive (band gap)
properties. Furthermore, we extend MatterGPT to simultaneously target multiple
properties, addressing the complex challenge of multi-objective inverse design
of crystals. Our approach showcases high validity, uniqueness, and novelty in
generated structures, as well as the ability to generate materials with
properties beyond the training data distribution. This work represents a
significant step forward in computational materials discovery, offering a
powerful and open tool for designing materials with tailored properties for
various applications in energy, electronics, and beyond.</p>

    <p>We have developed an efficient crystal structure prediction (CSP) method for
desired chemical compositions, specifically suited for compounds featuring
recurring molecules or rigid bodies. We applied this method to two metal
chalcogenides: $\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ and
$\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$, treating $\text{PS}_4$ as a tetrahedral
rigid body and $\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ as an ethane-like dimer rigid body.
Initial trials not only identified the experimentally observed structures of
these compounds but also uncovered several novel phases, including a new
stannite-type $\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ structure and a potential metastable
structure for $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ that exhibits significantly
lower energy than the observed phase, as evaluated by density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. We compared our results with those obtained using USPEX, a
popular CSP package leveraging genetic algorithms. Both methods predicted the
same lowest energy structures in both compounds. However, our method
demonstrated better performance in predicting metastable structures. The method
is implemented with Python code which is available at

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The phase-field crystal (PFC) model describes crystal structures at diffusive
timescales through a periodic, microscopic density field. It has been proposed
to model elasticity in crystal growth and encodes most of the phenomenology
related to the mechanical properties of crystals like dislocation nucleation
and motion, grain boundaries, and elastic or interface-energy anisotropies. To
overcome limitations to small systems, a coarse-grained formulation focusing on
slowly varying complex amplitudes of the microscopic density field has been
devised. This amplitude-PFC (APFC) model describes well elasticity and
dislocations while approximating microscopic features and being limited in
describing large-angle grain boundaries. We present here seminal concepts for a
hybrid multiscale PFC-APFC framework that combines the coarse-grained
description of the APFC model in bulk-like crystallites while exploiting PFC
resolution at dislocations, grain boundaries, and interfaces or surfaces. This
is achieved by coupling the two models via an advanced discretization based on
the Fourier spectral method and allowing for local solution updates. This
discretization also generalizes the description of boundary conditions for PFC
models. We showcase the framework capabilities through two-dimensional
benchmark simulations. We also show that the proposed formulation allows for
overcoming the limitations of the APFC model in describing large-angle grain
boundaries.</p>

    <p>The ionic bonding across the lattice and ordered microscopic structures endow
crystals with unique symmetry and determine their macroscopic properties.
Unconventional crystals, in particular, exhibit non-traditional lattice
structures or possess exotic physical properties, making them intriguing
subjects for investigation. Therefore, to accurately predict the physical and
chemical properties of crystals, it is crucial to consider long-range orders.
While GNN excels at capturing the local environment of atoms in crystals, they
often face challenges in effectively capturing longer-ranged interactions due
to their limited depth. In this paper, we propose CrysToGraph
($\textbf{Crys}$tals with $\textbf{T}$ransformers $\textbf{o}$n
$\textbf{Graph}$s), a novel transformer-based geometric graph network designed
specifically for unconventional crystalline systems, and UnconvBench, a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate models' predictive performance on
unconventional crystal materials such as defected crystals, low-dimension
crystals and MOF. CrysToGraph effectively captures short-range interactions
with transformer-based graph convolution blocks as well as long-range
interactions with graph-wise transformer blocks. CrysToGraph proofs its
effectiveness in modelling unconventional crystal materials in multiple tasks,
and moreover, it outperforms most existing methods, achieving new
state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of both unconventional crystals and

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge
distributions in compounds. In elemental crystalline materials, chemical bonds
between atoms of the same element favor symmetrically distributed electron
charges and centrosymmetric structures, making elemental ferroelectrics rare.
Compared to atoms, elemental clusters are intrinsically less symmetric and can
have various preferred orientations when they are assembled to form crystals.
Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to
break the inversion symmetry. By exploiting this concept, we show that sliding
ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP)
C$_{60}$, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Compared
to many metallic or semi-metallic elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP
C$_{60}$'s have sizable band gaps and several ferroelectric structures, which
are distinguishable by measuring their second-harmonic generation (SHG)
responses. Some of these phases show both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane
polarizations on the order of 0.2 pC/m. The out-of-plane and in-plane
polarizations can be switched independently and enable an easy-to-implement
construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable

    <p>Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline
assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard
protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from
experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer
simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long
history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real
space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the
crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this
problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates
obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known
facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context
of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination
polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors
for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be
systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas,
along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex
hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all
crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is
capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals
with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real
Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals
with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires
minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to
the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of
condensed matter physics and computational materials science.</p>

This mission requires lightsail materials that challenge the fundamentals of nanotechnology, requiring innovations in optics, material science and structural engineering. Unlike the microchip payload, which must be minimized in every dimension, such lightsails need meter-scale dimensions with nanoscale thickness and billions of nanoscale holes to enhance reflectivity and reduce mass. Our study employs neural topology optimization, revealing a novel pentagonal lattice-based photonic crystal (PhC) reflector. The optimized designs shorten acceleration times, therefore lowering launch costs significantly. Crucially, these designs also enable lightsail material fabrication with orders-of-magnitude reduction in costs. We have fabricated a 60 x 60 mm$^2$, 200nm thick, single-layer reflector perforated with over a billion nanoscale features; the highest aspect-ratio nanophotonic element to date. We achieve this with nearly 9,000 times cost reduction per m$^2$. Starshot lightsails will have several stringent requirements but will ultimately be driven by costs to build at scale.

    <p>The frequency-dependent optical spectrum is pivotal for a broad range of
applications, from material characterization to optoelectronics and energy

(DFT) data, have effectively alleviated the scalability limitations of DFT

prevailing machine learning (ML) efforts often focus on scalar properties such
as the band gap, overlooking the complexities of optical spectra. In this work,
we employ deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the frequency-dependent
complex-valued dielectric function across the infrared, visible, and
ultraviolet spectra directly from crystal structures. We explore multiple
architectures for multi-output spectral representation of the dielectric
function and utilize various multi-fidelity learning strategies, such as
transfer learning and fidelity embedding, to address the challenges associated
with the scarcity of high-fidelity DFT data. Additionally, we model key solar
cell absorption efficiency metrics, demonstrating that learning these
parameters is enhanced when integrated through a learning bias within the
learning of the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient. This study
demonstrates that leveraging multi-output and multi-fidelity ML techniques
enables accurate predictions of optical spectra from crystal structures,

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of
materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in
material science. Much interest is in material displaying critical displacive
behaviour, such as near a ferroelectric transition, charge-density waves, or in
general displacive second-order transitions. In these cases, molecular dynamics
suffer from a critical slowdown and emergent long-range fluctuations of the
order parameter. Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue:
Self-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent
Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods
that fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics
trajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP).
Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often
overlooked in the proximity of critical points.
  Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on
critical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static
correlation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours,
and dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal
transport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation
of dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the
standard TDEP approach.
  Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic
potential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and
the metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In the pursuit of advanced energy storage solutions, the crystal structure of
ionic conductors plays a pivotal role in facilitating ion transport. The
conventional structural design principle that compounds with the body-centered
cubic (BCC) anionic frameworks have high ionic conductivity is well known. We
have extended the conventional design principle by uncovering that many of the
anionic frameworks of Ag-ion conductors are characterized by tetrahedrally
packed (TP) structures. Leveraging our findings, we have virtually screened TP
framework compounds, uncovering their intrinsic potential for superior ionic
conductivity through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our
design principle is applicable to Ag$^+$ and other mobile ions, including
Li$^+$ and F$^-$. We proposed the Met2Ion method to generate ionic crystal
structures using metal crystal structures as templates and demonstrated that
new ionic conductors with TP frameworks can be discovered. This work paves the
way for the discovery and development of next-generation energy storage
materials with enhanced performance.</p>

    <p>Utilizations of silicon-based luminescent devices are restricted by the
indirect-gap nature of diamond silicon. In this study, the high-throughput
method is employed to expedite discoveries of direct-gap silicon crystals. The
machine learning (ML) potential is utilized to construct a dataset comprising
2637 silicon allotropes, which is subsequently screened using an ML Hamiltonian
model and density functional theory calculations, resulting in identification
of 47 direct-gap Si structures. We calculate transition dipole moments (TDM),
energies, and phonon bandstructures of these structures to validate their
performance. Additionally, we recalculate bandgaps of these structures
employing the HSE06 functional. 22 silicon allotropes are identified as
potential photovoltaic materials. Among them, the energy per atom of Si22-Pm,
which has a direct bandgap of 1.27 eV, is 0.026 eV/atom higher than diamond
silicon. Si18-C2/m, which has a direct bandgap of 0.796 eV, exhibits the
highest TDM among identified structures. Si16-P21/c, which has a direct bandgap
of 0.907 eV, has the mass density of 2.316 g/cm3, which is the highest among
identified structures and higher than that of diamond silicon. The structure
Si12-P1, which possesses a direct bandgap of 1.69 eV, exhibits the highest
spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) among identified structures at
32.28%, surpassing that of diamond silicon. This study offers insights into
properties of silicon crystals while presenting a systematic high-throughput

    <p>Effectively representing materials as text has the potential to leverage the
vast advancements of large language models (LLMs) for discovering new
materials. While LLMs have shown remarkable success in various domains, their
application to materials science remains underexplored. A fundamental challenge
is the lack of understanding of how to best utilize text-based representations
for materials modeling. This challenge is further compounded by the absence of
a comprehensive benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities and
limitations of these text representations in capturing the complexity of
material systems. To address this gap, we propose MatText, a suite of
benchmarking tools and datasets designed to systematically evaluate the
performance of language models in modeling materials. MatText encompasses nine
distinct text-based representations for material systems, including several
novel representations. Each representation incorporates unique inductive biases
that capture relevant information and integrate prior physical knowledge about
materials. Additionally, MatText provides essential tools for training and
benchmarking the performance of language models in the context of materials
science. These tools include standardized dataset splits for each
representation, probes for evaluating sensitivity to geometric factors, and
tools for seamlessly converting crystal structures into text. Using MatText, we
conduct an extensive analysis of the capabilities of language models in
modeling materials. Our findings reveal that current language models
consistently struggle to capture the geometric information crucial for
materials modeling across all representations. Instead, these models tend to
leverage local information, which is emphasized in some of our novel
representations. Our analysis underscores MatText's ability to reveal
shortcomings of text-based methods for materials design.</p>

    <p>A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure
of nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a
generative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that is trained
on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction
pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic
cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the
information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find
that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small
as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity,
including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can
successfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five
times, with average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by
post-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving
structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments.
We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical
simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of
previously unsolved nano-materials.</p>

    <p>Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the generation of realistic
data by training generative models on large datasets of text, images, and
audio. While these models have demonstrated exceptional performance in
generating novel and plausible data, it remains an open question whether they
can effectively accelerate scientific discovery through the data generation and
drive significant advancements across various scientific fields. In particular,
the discovery of new inorganic materials with promising properties poses a
critical challenge, both scientifically and for industrial applications.
However, unlike textual or image data, materials, or more specifically crystal
structures, consist of multiple types of variables - including lattice vectors,
atom positions, and atomic species. This complexity in data give rise to a
variety of approaches for representing and generating such data. Consequently,
the design choices of generative models for crystal structures remain an open
question. In this study, we explore a new type of diffusion model for the
generative inverse design of crystal structures, with a backbone based on a
Transformer architecture. We demonstrate our models are superior to previous
methods in their versatility for generating crystal structures with desired

sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to
representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps
of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states. The

    <p>Gap opening remains elusive in copper chalcogenides (Cu$_{2}X$, $X$ = S, Se
and Te), not least because Hubbard + $U$, hybrid functional and ${GW}$ methods
have also failed. In this work, we elucidate that their failure originates from
a severe underestimation of the 4$s$-3$d$ orbital splitting of the Cu atom,
which leads to a band-order inversion in the presence of an anionic crystal
field. As a result, the Fermi energy is pinned due to symmetry, yielding an
invariant zero gap. Utilizing the hybrid pseudopotentials to correct the
underestimation on the atomic side opens up gaps of experimental magnitude in
Cu$_{2}X$, suggesting their predominantly electronic nature. Our work not only
clarifies the debate about the Cu$_{2}X$ gap, but also provides a way to
identify which of the different methods really captures the physical essence
and which is the result of error cancellation.</p>

    <p>Crystalline materials are a fundamental component in next-generation
technologies, yet modeling their distribution presents unique computational
challenges. Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a
vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key
indicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental
tasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known
composition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their
stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve
state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more
flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit
the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and
periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the
flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning
crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard
benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry
calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of
integration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open

    <p>Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$)
provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing
transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating
self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are
particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic
states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate
determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In
practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior
knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive
first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based
on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as
descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical
environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the
prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative
linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation
theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data
from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our
model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and
$V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or
DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the
prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while
approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust
transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and
design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various
technological applications.</p>

    <p>Machine learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for generating new
molecular and material structures. The success of state-of-the-art models stems
from their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation,
rotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called
Response Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or
molecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently,
any perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure
back to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score
matching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine
learning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising
model, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects
permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first
model to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a
small organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project,
and one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.</p>

    <p>Polymorphism contributes to the diversity of nature, so that even materials
having identical chemical compositions exhibit variations in properties because
of different lattice symmetries. Thus, if stacked together into multilayers,
polymorphs may work as an alternative approach to the sequential deposition of
layers with different chemical compositions. However, selective polymorph
crystallization during conventional thin film synthesis is not trivial; e.g.
opting for step-like changes of temperature and/or pressure correlated with
switching from one polymorph to another during synthesis is tricky, since it
may cause degradation of the structural quality. In the present work, applying
the disorder-induced ordering approach we fabricated such multilayered
polymorph structures using ion beams. We show that during ion irradiation of
gallium oxide, the dynamic annealing of disorder may be tuned towards
self-assembling of several polymorph interfaces, consistently with theoretical
modelling. Specifically, we demonstrated multilayers with two polymorph
interface repetitions obtained in one ion beam assisted fabrication step.
Importantly, single crystal structure of the polymorphs was maintained in
between interfaces exhibiting repeatable crystallographic relationships,
correlating with optical cross-sectional maps. This data paves the way for
enhancing functionalities in materials with not previously thought capabilities
of ion beam technology.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The prototypical $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in zirconium is an ideal
test-bed for our understanding of polymorphism under extreme loading
conditions. After half a century of study, a consensus had emerged that the
transition is realized via one of two distinct displacive mechanisms, depending
on the nature of the compression path. However, recent dynamic-compression
experiments equipped with in situ diffraction diagnostics performed in the past
few years have revealed new transition mechanisms, demonstrating that our
understanding of the underlying atomistic dynamics and transition kinetics is
in fact far from complete. We present classical molecular dynamics simulations
of the $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in single-crystal zirconium
shock-compressed along the [0001] axis using a machine-learning-class
potential. The transition is predicted to proceed primarily via a modified
version of the two-stage Usikov-Zilberstein mechanism, whereby the
high-pressure $\omega$-phase heterogeneously nucleates at boundaries between
grains of an intermediate $\beta$-phase. We further observe the fomentation of
atomistic disorder at the junctions between $\beta$ grains, leading to the
formation of highly defective interstitial material between the $\omega$
grains. We directly compare synthetic x-ray diffraction patterns generated from
our simulations with those obtained using femtosecond diffraction in recent
dynamic-compression experiments, and show that the simulations produce the same
unique, anisotropic diffuse scattering signal unlike any previously seen from
an elemental metal. Our simulations suggest that the diffuse signal arises from
a combination of thermal diffuse scattering, nanoparticle-like scattering from
residual kinetically stabilized $\alpha$ and $\beta$ grains, and scattering
from interstitial defective structures.</p>

    <p>This paper presents a study on the integration of domain-specific knowledge in prompt engineering to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in scientific domains. A benchmark dataset is curated to encapsulate the intricate physical-chemical properties of small molecules, their drugability for pharmacology, alongside the functional attributes of enzymes and crystal materials, underscoring the relevance and applicability across biological and chemical domains.The proposed domain-knowledge embedded prompt engineering method outperforms traditional prompt engineering strategies on various metrics, including capability, accuracy, F1 score, and hallucination drop. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies on complex materials including the MacMillan catalyst, paclitaxel, and lithium cobalt oxide. The results suggest that domain-knowledge prompts can guide LLMs to generate more accurate and relevant responses, highlighting the potential of LLMs as powerful tools for scientific discovery and innovation when equipped with domain-specific prompts.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The crystallographic texture is a key organization feature of many technical
and biological materials. In these materials, especially hierarchically
structured ones, the preferential alignment of the nano constituents is heavily
influencing the macroscopic behaviour of the material. In order to study local
crystallographic texture with both high spatial and angular resolution, we
developed Texture tomography (TexTOM). This approach allows to model the
diffraction data of polycrystalline materials by using the full reciprocal
space of the ensemble of crystals and describe the texture in each voxel via a
orientation distribution function. This means, it provides 3D reconstructions
of the local texture by measuring the probabilities of all crystal
orientations. The TexTOM approach addresses limitations associated with
existing models: It correlates the intensities from several Bragg reflections,
thus reduces ambiguities resulting from symmetry. Further, it yields
quantitative probability distributions of local real space crystal orientations
without further assumptions on the sample structure. Finally, its efficient
mathematical formulation enables reconstructions faster than the time-scale of
the experiment. In this manuscript, we present the mathematical model, the
inversion strategy and its current experimental implementation. We show
characterizations of simulated data as well as experimental data obtained from
a synthetic, inorganic model sample, the silica-witherite biomorph. In
conclusion, Tex-TOM provides a versatile framework to reconstruct 3D
quantitative texture information for polycrystalline samples. In this way, it
opens the door for unprecedented insights into the nanostructural makeup of
natural and technical materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The structural, dielectric, and thermodynamic properties of the
hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric crystal potassium dihydrogen phosphate
($\mathbf{KH_2PO_4}$), KDP for short, differ significantly from those of DKDP
($\mathbf{KD_2PO_4}$). It is well established that deuteration affects the
interplay of hydrogen-bond switches and heavy ion displacements that underlie
the emergence of macroscopic polarization, but a detailed microscopic model is
missing. Here we show that all-atom path integral molecular dynamics
simulations can predict the isotope effects, revealing the microscopic
mechanism that differentiates KDP and DKDP. Proton tunneling in the hydrogen
bonds generates phosphate configurations that do not contribute to the
polarization. These dipolar defects are always present in KDP, but disappear at
low temperatures in DKDP, which behaves more classically. Quantum disorder
confers residual entropy to ferroelectric KDP, explaining its lower spontaneous
polarization and transition entropy relative to DKDP. Tunneling should also
contribute to the anomalous heat capacity observed in KDP near absolute zero.
The prominent role of quantum fluctuations in KDP is related to the unusual
strength of the hydrogen bonds in this system and should be equally important
in the other crystals of the KDP family, which exhibit similar isotope effects.</p>

    <p>Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made
significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and
transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial
resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and
electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample
preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate
theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer
simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a
rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such
as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs,
nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and
computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur
when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single
and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the
generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the
irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio
methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion
systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in
energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for
the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative
approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and
secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and
dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of
irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>There is growing interest in engineering unconventional computing devices that leverage the intrinsic dynamics of physical substrates to perform fast and energy-efficient computations. Granular metamaterials are one such substrate that has emerged as a promising platform for building wave-based information processing devices with the potential to integrate sensing, actuation, and computation. Their high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics result in nontrivial and sometimes counter-intuitive wave responses that can be shaped by the material properties, geometry, and configuration of individual grains. Such highly tunable rich dynamics can be utilized for mechanical computing in special-purpose applications. However, there are currently no general frameworks for the inverse design of large-scale granular materials. Here, we build upon the similarity between the spatiotemporal dynamics of wave propagation in material and the computational dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks to develop a gradient-based optimization framework for harmonically driven granular crystals. We showcase how our framework can be utilized to design basic logic gates where mechanical vibrations carry the information at predetermined frequencies. We compare our design methodology with classic gradient-free methods and find that our approach discovers higher-performing configurations with less computational effort. Our findings show that a gradient-based optimization method can greatly expand the design space of metamaterials and provide the opportunity to systematically traverse the parameter space to find materials with the desired functionalities.</p>

    <p>Identifying local structural motifs and packing patterns of molecular solids
is a challenging task for both simulation and experiment. We demonstrate two
novel approaches to characterize local environments in different polymorphs of
molecular crystals using learning models that employ either flexibly learned or
handcrafted molecular representations. In the first case, we follow our earlier
work on graph learning in molecular crystals, deploying an atomistic graph
convolutional network, combined with molecule-wise aggregation, to enable
per-molecule environmental classification. For the second model, we develop a
new set of descriptors based on symmetry functions combined with a point-vector
representation of the molecules, encoding information about the positions as
well as relative orientations of the molecule. We demonstrate very high
classification accuracy for both approaches on urea and nicotinamide crystal
polymorphs, and practical applications to the analysis of dynamical trajectory
data for nanocrystals and solid-solid interfaces. Both architectures are
applicable to a wide range of molecules and diverse topologies, providing an
essential step in the exploration of complex condensed matter phenomena.</p>

    <p>We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model
specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline

the crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative
modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and
sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate
crystals by directly predicting the species and locations of
symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. We demonstrate the advantages of
CrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and
element substitution compared to conventional methods implemented in popular
crystal structure prediction software. Moreover, we showcase the application of
CrystalFormer of property-guided materials design in a plug-and-play manner.
Our analysis shows that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry
knowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling
systematic exploration of crystalline materials. The simplicity, generality,
and flexibility of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be
the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a

    <p>Recent advances in deep learning generative models (GMs) have created high

of viable structures. Coupling such capabilities with physically significant
data to construct trained models for materials discovery is crucial to moving

autoencoder (Cond-CDVAE) approach, which is tailored to allow user-defined
material and physical parameters such as composition and pressure. This model
is trained on an expansive dataset containing over 670,000 local minimum
structures, including a rich spectrum of high-pressure structures, along with
ambient-pressure structures in Materials Project database. We demonstrate that
the Cond-CDVAE model can generate physically plausible structures with high
fidelity under diverse pressure conditions without necessitating local
optimization, accurately predicting 59.3% of the 3,547 unseen ambient-pressure
experimental structures within 800 structure samplings, with the accuracy rate
climbing to 83.2% for structures comprising fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell.
These results meet or exceed those achieved via conventional CSP methods based

    <p>Predicting the strength of materials requires considering various length and
time scales, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Peierls stress
measures material strength by evaluating dislocation resistance to plastic
flow, reliant on elastic lattice responses and crystal slip energy landscape.
Computational challenges due to the non-local and non-equilibrium nature of
dislocations prohibit Peierls stress evaluation from state-of-the-art material
databases. We propose a data-driven framework that leverages neural networks
trained on force field simulations to understand crystal plasticity physics,
predicting Peierls stress from material parameters derived via density
functional theory computations, which are otherwise computationally intensive
for direct dislocation modeling. This physics transfer approach successfully
screen the strength of metallic alloys from a limited number of single-point
calculations with chemical accuracy. Guided by these predictions, we fabricate
high-strength binary alloys previously unexplored, utilizing high-throughput
ion beam deposition techniques. The framework extends to problems facing the
accuracy-performance dilemma in general by harnessing the hierarchy of physics

    <p>First-principles calculations have been used to investigate the electronic

network, a graphene-like structure composed of not only hexagonal ring but also
octagonal and square rings. Nontrivial topological properties have been found
in two of them, with a stoichiometry of C4BN and C2(BN)2. The former C4BN is
predicted to be a type-II Dirac semimetal with a superconducting critical
temperature Tc=0.38K, which is similar to the pure carbon biphenylene network
(C-BPN). The latter shows a novel isolated edge state exists between the
conduction and valence bands. By regulation of strains and virtual-crystal
approximation calculations, we found the annihilation of two pairs of Dirac
points (DPs) in the non-high symmetric region (non-HSR) causes the two
corresponding edge states stick together to generate this isolated edge state.
In addition, we found that one pair of DPs arises from the shift of DPs in the
C-BPN, while another new pair of DPs emerges around the Time Reversal Invariant
Momenta (TRIM) point X due to the doping of boron and nitrogen. We constructed
a tight-binding (TB) model to reveal the mechanism of forming the isolated edge
state from the C-BPN to C2(BN)2. This study not only demonstrates the existence
and mechanism of forming the isolated edge state in semimetals, but also
provides an example in which the DPs can move away from the high-symmetry

to address. Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale
of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$). The bulk of
existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by
predicting target properties with graphs as input. However, the most exciting
applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is
currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.
  We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by
presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI)
nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M
edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal
types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B
edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal
structures (CHILI-100K). We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure
prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research. We
benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these
benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work. To the best of
our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial
datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset
as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and
elemental diversity.</p>

    <p>While density functional theory (DFT) serves as a prevalent computational
approach in electronic structure calculations, its computational demands and
scalability limitations persist. Recently, leveraging neural networks to
parameterize the Kohn-Sham DFT Hamiltonian has emerged as a promising avenue
for accelerating electronic structure computations. Despite advancements,
challenges such as the necessity for computing extensive DFT training data to
explore each new system and the complexity of establishing accurate ML models
for multi-elemental materials still exist. Addressing these hurdles, this study
introduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian
matrices obtained from first-principles DFT calculations of nearly all crystal
structures on the Materials Project. We demonstrate its generality in
predicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including
complex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\'e twisted
bilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we
utilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of
electronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940
crystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering
a reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this
universal Hamiltonian model lays the groundwork for advancements in diverse
fields, such as easily providing a huge data set of electronic structures and
also making the materials design across the whole periodic table possible.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Ultrafast heating of solids with modern X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs)
leads to a unique set of conditions that is characterized by the simultaneous
presence of heated electrons in a cold ionic lattice. In this work, we analyze
the effect of electronic heating on the dynamic structure factor (DSF) in bulk
Aluminium (Al) with a face-centered cubic lattice and in silicon (Si) with a
crystal diamond structure using first-principles linear-response time-dependent
density functional theory simulations. We find a thermally induced red shift of
the collective plasmon excitation in both materials. In addition, we show that
the heating of the electrons in Al can lead to the formation of a
double-plasmon peak due to the extension of the Landau damping region to
smaller wavenumbers. Finally, we demonstrate that thermal effects generate a
measurable and distinct signature (peak-valley structure) in the DSF of Si at
small frequencies. Our simulations indicate that there is a variety of new
features in the spectrum of X-ray-driven solids, specifically at finite
momentum transfer, which can probed in upcoming X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS)
experiments at various XFEL facilities.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We propose fine-tuning large language models for generation of stable
materials. While unorthodox, fine-tuning large language models on text-encoded
atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90% of sampled
structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using
energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and
gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned
LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice
the rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text
prompting's inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for
unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures
and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models' ability
to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale,
suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for
atomistic data.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystals are the foundation of numerous scientific and industrial
applications. While various learning-based approaches have been proposed for
crystal generation, existing methods seldom consider the space group constraint
which is crucial in describing the geometry of crystals and closely relevant to
many desirable properties. However, considering space group constraint is
challenging owing to its diverse and nontrivial forms. In this paper, we reduce
the space group constraint into an equivalent formulation that is more
tractable to be handcrafted into the generation process. In particular, we
translate the space group constraint into two parts: the basis constraint of
the invariant logarithmic space of the lattice matrix and the Wyckoff position
constraint of the fractional coordinates. Upon the derived constraints, we then
propose DiffCSP++, a novel diffusion model that has enhanced a previous work
DiffCSP by further taking space group constraint into account. Experiments on
several popular datasets verify the benefit of the involvement of the space
group constraint, and show that our DiffCSP++ achieves promising performance on
crystal structure prediction, ab initio crystal generation and controllable
generation with customized space groups.</p>

    <p>Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use
in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However,
LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and
inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and
data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can
dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data
on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput
workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage
ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science
concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data
(such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in
computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining
uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of
responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively
mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli,
electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data
sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and
run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning
force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free
approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a
pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models. Code

    <p>In this work, we propose a novel approach to generate universal atomic
embeddings, significantly enhancing the representational and accuracy aspects
of atomic embeddings, which ultimately improves the accuracy of property
prediction. Moreover, we demonstrate the excellent transferability of universal
atomic embeddings across different databases and various property tasks. Our
approach centers on developing the CrystalTransformer model. Unlike traditional
methods, this model does not possess a fundamental graph network architecture
but utilizes the Transformer architecture to extract latent atomic features.
This allows the CrystalTransformer to mitigate the inherent topological
information bias of graph neural networks while maximally preserving the atomic
chemical information, making it more accurate in encoding complex atomic
features and thereby offering a deeper understanding of the atoms in materials.
In our research, we highlight the advantages of CrystalTransformer in
generating universal atomic embeddings through comparisons with current
mainstream graph neural network models. Furthermore, we validate the
effectiveness of universal atomic embeddings in enhancing the accuracy of model
predictions for properties and demonstrate their transferability across
different databases and property tasks through various experiments. As another
key aspect of our study, we discover the strong physical interpretability
implied in universal atomic embeddings through clustering and correlation
analysis, indicating the immense potential of our universal atomic embeddings
as atomic fingerprints.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In engineering crystal plasticity inelastic mechanisms correspond to
tensorial zero-energy valleys in the space of macroscopic strains. The flat
nature of such valleys is in contradiction with the fact that plastic slips,
mimicking lattice-invariant shears, are inherently discrete. A reconciliation
has recently been achieved in the mesoscopic tensorial model (MTM) of crystal
plasticity, which introduces periodically modulated energy valleys while also
capturing in a geometrically exact way the crystallographically-specific
aspects of plastic slips. In this paper, we extend the MTM framework, which in
its original form had the appearance of a discretized nonlinear elasticity
theory, by explicitly introducing the concept of plastic deformation. The
ensuing model contains a novel matrix-valued spin variable, representing the
quantized plastic distortion, whose rate-independent evolution can be described
by a discrete (quasi-)automaton. The proposed reformulation of the MTM leads to
a considerable computational speedup associated with the use of a robust and
efficient hybrid Gauss-Newton--Cauchy energy minimization algorithm. To
illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach, we present a detailed
case-study focusing on the aspects of crystal plasticity that are beyond reach
for the classical continuum theory. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that
the re-formulated MTM is fully adequate to deal with the intermittency of
plastic response under quasi-static loading. In particular, our numerical
experiments show that the statistics of dislocational avalanches, associated
with plastic yield in 2D square crystals, exhibits a power-law tail with a
critical exponent matching the value predicted by general theoretical
considerations and also independently observed in discrete-dislocation-dynamics
(DDD) simulations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal dislocation dynamics, especially at high temperatures, represents a
subject where experimental phenomenological input is commonly required, and
parameter-free predictions, starting from quantum methods, have been beyond
reach. This is especially true for phenomena like stacking faults and
dislocation cross-slip, which are computationally intractable with methods like
density functional theory, as $\sim 10^5-10^6$ atoms are required to reliably
simulate such systems. Hence, this work extends quantum-mechanical accuracy to
mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations and opens unprecedented possibilities
in material design for extreme mechanical conditions with direct atomistic
insight at the deformation mesoscale. To accomplish this, we construct a
Bayesian machine-learned force field (MLFF) from ab initio quantum training
data, enabling direct observations of high-temperature and high-stress
dislocation dynamics in single-crystalline Cu with atomistic resolution. In
doing so, a generalizable training protocol is developed for construction of
MLFFs for dislocation kinetics, with wide-ranging applicability to other single
element systems and alloys. The resulting FLARE MLFF provides excellent
predictions of static bulk elastic properties, stacking fault widths and
energies, dynamic evolutions and mobilities of edge and screw dislocations, as
well as cross-slip energy barriers for screw dislocations, all of which are
compared to available experimental measurements. This work marks the first
reliable quantitative determination of dislocation mobilities and cross-slip
barriers, demonstrating a substantial advancement over previous empirical and

    <p>Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a prevalent technique in materials characterization. While the analysis of PXRD often requires extensive human manual intervention, and most automated method only achieved at coarse-grained level. The more difficult and important task of fine-grained crystal structure prediction from PXRD remains unaddressed. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant deep generative model for end-to-end crystal structure prediction from PXRD. Unlike previous crystal structure prediction methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet's effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 in conditional crystal structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet enables the direct prediction of crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for manual intervention and external databases.

    <p>Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the

research has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically
analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus
material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The
structural optimizations have been carried out using pseudopotential based
Quantum espresso code. Computed structural parameters are in good agreement
with literature reports. The optimized crystal structures were used for
computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric properties.
Dynamical stability predicts that this material can withstand up to 10% of
tensile strain. Computed electronic structure reveals material to be indirect
wide band gap ferromagnet with magnetic moment 1{\mu}B. With increase in the
biaxial tensile strain the band gap decreases. Furthermore, the computed
magneto-thermoelectric properties predict high Seebeck coefficient ~ 400
{\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity of ~ 0.93 W/m.K in LaBrI which results in
a high ZT ~ 1.84 for 4% strain at 800 K. The present study supports the fact
that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE
properties making it to be a promising material for TE applications at higher

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The revolution in materials in the past century was built on a knowledge of
the atomic arrangements and the structure-property relationship. The sine qua
non for obtaining quantitative structural information is single crystal
crystallography. However, increasingly we need to solve structures in cases
where the information content in our input signal is significantly degraded,
for example, due to orientational averaging of grains, finite size effects due
to nanostructure, and mixed signals due to sample heterogeneity. Understanding
the structure property relationships in such situations is, if anything, more
important and insightful, yet we do not have robust approaches for
accomplishing it. In principle, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
are promising approaches since they augment information in the degraded input
signal with prior knowledge learned from large databases of already known
structures. Here we present a novel ML approach, a variational query-based
multi-branch deep neural network that has the promise to be a robust but
general tool to address this problem end-to-end. We demonstrate the approach on
computed powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), along with partial chemical

modified electron density we call the Cartesian mapped electron density (CMED),
that straightforwardly allows our ML model to learn material structures across
different chemistries, symmetries and crystal systems. When evaluated on
theoretically simulated data for the cubic and trigonal crystal systems, the
system achieves up to $93.4\%$ average similarity with the ground truth on
unseen materials, both with known and partially-known chemical composition

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Particle tracking is commonly used to study time-dependent behavior in many
different types of physical and chemical systems involving constituents that
span many length scales, including atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, granular
particles, etc. Behaviors of interest studied using particle tracking
information include disorder-order transitions, thermodynamic phase
transitions, structural transitions, protein folding, crystallization,
gelation, swarming, avalanches and fracture. A common challenge in studies of
these systems involves change detection. Change point detection discerns when a
temporal signal undergoes a change in distribution. These changes can be local
or global, instantaneous or prolonged, obvious or subtle. Moreover, system-wide
changes marking an interesting physical or chemical phenomenon (e.g.
crystallization) are often preceded by events (e.g. pre-nucleation clusters)
that are localized and can occur anywhere at anytime in the system. For these
reasons, detecting events in particle trajectories generated by molecular
simulation is challenging and typically accomplished via ad hoc solutions
unique to the behavior and system under study. Consequently, methods for event
detection lack generality, and those used in one field are not easily used by
scientists in other fields. Here we present a new Python-based tool, dupin,
that allows for event detection from particle trajectory data irrespective of
the system details. dupin works by creating a signal representing the
simulation and partitioning the signal based on events (changes within the
trajectory). This approach allows for studies where manual annotating of event
boundaries would require a prohibitive amount of time. Furthermore, dupin can
serve as a tool in automated and reproducible workflows. We demonstrate the
application of dupin using two examples and discuss its applicability to a
wider class of problems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Discovering crystal structures with specific chemical properties has become
an increasingly important focus in material science. However, current models
are limited in their ability to generate new crystal lattices, as they only
consider atomic positions or chemical composition. To address this issue, we
propose a probabilistic diffusion model that utilizes a geometrically
equivariant GNN to consider atomic positions and crystal lattices jointly. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we introduce a new generation metric
inspired by Frechet Inception Distance, but based on GNN energy prediction
rather than InceptionV3 used in computer vision. In addition to commonly used
metrics like validity, which assesses the plausibility of a structure, this new
metric offers a more comprehensive evaluation of our model's capabilities. Our
experiments on existing benchmarks show the significance of our diffusion
model. We also show that our method can effectively learn meaningful
representations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal structure design is important for the discovery of new highly
functional materials because crystal structure strongly influences material
properties. Crystal structures are composed of space-filling polyhedra, which
affect material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant.
However, most conventional methods of crystal structure prediction use random
structure generation methods that do not take space-filling polyhedra into
account, contributing to the inefficiency of materials development. In this
work, we propose a crystal structure generation method based on discrete
geometric analysis of polyhedra information. In our method, the shape and
connectivity of a space-filling polyhedron are represented as a dual periodic
graph, and the crystal structure is generated by the standard realization of
this graph. We demonstrate that this method can correctly generate
face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic structures
from dual periodic graphs. This work is a first step toward generating
undiscovered crystal structures based on the target polyhedra, leading to major
advances in materials design in areas including electronics and energy storage.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in
driving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and
carbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design
by directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property
constraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low
success rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited
set of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates
stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further
be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property
constraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative
process that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,
coordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to
enable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled
dataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen
are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times
closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully
generates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as
mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate
multi-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have
both high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain
risk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of
MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a
universal generative model for materials design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative design marks a significant data-driven advancement in the
exploration of novel inorganic materials, which entails learning the symmetry
equivalent to the crystal structure prediction (CSP) task and subsequent
learning of their target properties. Generative models have been developed in
the last few years that use custom Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion models. While periodicity and global
Euclidian symmetry in three dimensions through translations, rotations and
reflections have recently been accounted for, symmetry constraints within
allowed space groups have not. This is especially important because the final
step involves energy relaxation on the generated crystal structures to find the
relaxed crystal structure, typically using Density Functional Theory (DFT). To
address this explicitly, we introduce a generative design framework (WyCryst),
composed of three pivotal components: 1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic
crystal representation, 2) a property-directed VAE model and 3) an automated
DFT workflow for structure refinement. Our model selectively generates
materials that follow the ground truth of unit cell space group symmetry by
encoding the Wyckoff representation for each space group. We successfully
reproduce a variety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and
221), CsPbI3 (SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both
ground state as well as polymorphic structure predictions. We also generate
several new ternary materials not found in the inorganic materials database
(Materials Project), which are proved to be stable, retaining their symmetry,
and we also check their phonon stability, using our automated DFT workflow
highlighting the validity of our approach. We believe our symmetry-aware
WyCryst takes a vital step towards AI-driven inorganic materials discovery.</p>

    <p>Machine learning (ML) has seen promising developments in materials science,
yet its efficacy largely depends on detailed crystal structural data, which are
often complex and hard to obtain, limiting their applicability in real-world
material synthesis processes. An alternative, using compositional descriptors,
offers a simpler approach by indicating the elemental ratios of compounds
without detailed structural insights. However, accurately representing
materials solely with compositional descriptors presents challenges due to
polymorphism, where a single composition can correspond to various structural
arrangements, creating ambiguities in its representation. To this end, we
introduce PCRL, a novel approach that employs probabilistic modeling of
composition to capture the diverse polymorphs from available structural
information. Extensive evaluations on sixteen datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of PCRL in learning compositional representation, and our
analysis highlights its potential applicability of PCRL in material discovery.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) techniques and atomistic modeling have rapidly
transformed materials design and discovery. Specifically, generative models can
swiftly propose promising materials for targeted applications. However, the
predicted properties of materials through the generative models often do not
match with calculated properties through ab initio calculations. This
discrepancy can arise because the generated coordinates are not fully relaxed,
whereas the many properties are derived from relaxed structures. Neural
network-based potentials (NNPs) can expedite the process by providing relaxed
structures from the initially generated ones. Nevertheless, acquiring data to
train NNPs for this purpose can be extremely challenging as it needs to
encompass previously unknown structures. This study utilized extended ensemble
molecular dynamics (MD) to secure a broad range of liquid- and solid-phase
configurations in one of the metallic systems, nickel. Then, we could
significantly reduce them through active learning without losing much accuracy.
We found that the NNP trained from the distilled data could predict different
energy-minimized closed-pack crystal structures even though those structures
were not explicitly part of the initial data. Furthermore, the data can be
translated to other metallic systems (aluminum and niobium), without repeating
the sampling and distillation processes. Our approach to data acquisition and
distillation has demonstrated the potential to expedite NNP development and
enhance materials design and discovery by integrating generative models.</p>

    <p>Reticular materials, including metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic
frameworks, combine relative ease of synthesis and an impressive range of
applications in various fields, from gas storage to biomedicine. Diverse
properties arise from the variation of building units$\unicode{x2013}$metal
centers and organic linkers$\unicode{x2013}$in almost infinite chemical space.
Such variation substantially complicates experimental design and promotes the
use of computational methods. In particular, the most successful artificial
intelligence algorithms for predicting properties of reticular materials are
atomic-level graph neural networks, which optionally incorporate domain
knowledge. Nonetheless, the data-driven inverse design involving these models
suffers from incorporation of irrelevant and redundant features such as full
atomistic graph and network topology. In this study, we propose a new way of
representing materials, aiming to overcome the limitations of existing methods;
the message passing is performed on a coarse-grained crystal graph that
comprises molecular building units. To highlight the merits of our approach, we
assessed predictive performance and energy efficiency of neural networks built
on different materials representations, including composition-based and
crystal-structure-aware models. Coarse-grained crystal graph neural networks
showed decent accuracy at low computational costs, making them a valuable
alternative to omnipresent atomic-level algorithms. Moreover, the presented
models can be successfully integrated into an inverse materials design pipeline
as estimators of the objective function. Overall, the coarse-grained crystal
graph framework is aimed at challenging the prevailing atom-centric perspective

energy. That is, DOS is not solely determined by the crystalline material but
also by the energy levels, which has been neglected in previous works. In this
paper, we propose to integrate heterogeneous information obtained from the
crystalline materials and the energies via a multi-modal transformer, thereby
modeling the complex relationships between the atoms in the crystalline
materials and various energy levels for DOS prediction. Moreover, we propose to
utilize prompts to guide the model to learn the crystal structural
system-specific interactions between crystalline materials and energies.
Extensive experiments on two types of DOS, i.e., Phonon DOS and Electron DOS,
with various real-world scenarios demonstrate the superiority of
DOSTransformer. The source code for DOSTransformer is available at

    <p>Two-dimensional materials with Rashba split bands near the Fermi level are
key to developing upcoming next-generation spintronics. They enable generating,
detecting, and manipulating spin currents without an external magnetic field.
Here, we propose BiAs as a novel layered semiconductor with large Rashba
splitting in bulk and monolayer forms. Using first-principles calculations, we
determined the lowest energy structure of BiAs and its basic electronic
properties. Bulk BiAs has a layered crystal structure with two atoms in a
rhombohedral primitive cell, similar to the parent Bi and As elemental phases.
It is a semiconductor with a narrow and indirect band gap. The spin-orbit
coupling leads to Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting and characteristic spin
texture around the L-point in the Brillouin zone of the hexagonal conventional
unit cell, with Rashba energy and Rashba coupling constant for valence
(conduction) band of $E_R$= 137 meV (93 meV) and $\alpha_R$= 6.05 eV\AA~(4.6
eV{\AA}). In monolayer form (i.e., composed of a BiAs bilayer), BiAs has a much
larger and direct band gap at $\Gamma$, with a circular spin texture
characteristic of a pure Rashba effect. The Rashba energy $E_R$= 18 meV and
Rashba coupling constant $\alpha_R$= 1.67 eV{\AA} of monolayer BiAs are quite
large compared to other known 2D materials, and these values are shown to
increase under tensile biaxial strain.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative models trained on internet-scale data are capable of generating novel and realistic texts, images, and videos. A natural next question is whether these models can advance science, for example by generating novel stable materials. Traditionally, models with explicit structures (e.g., graphs) have been used in modeling structural relationships in scientific data (e.g., atoms and bonds in crystals), but generating structures can be difficult to scale to large and complex systems. Another challenge in generating materials is the mismatch between standard generative modeling metrics and downstream applications. For instance, common metrics such as the reconstruction error do not correlate well with the downstream goal of discovering stable materials. In this work, we tackle the scalability challenge by developing a unified crystal representation that can represent any crystal structure (UniMat), followed by training a diffusion probabilistic model on these UniMat representations. Our empirical results suggest that despite the lack of explicit structure modeling, UniMat can generate high fidelity crystal structures from larger and more complex chemical systems, outperforming previous graph-based approaches under various generative modeling metrics. To better connect the generation quality of materials to downstream applications, such as discovering novel stable materials, we propose additional metrics for evaluating generative models of materials, including per-composition formation energy and stability with respect to convex hulls through decomposition energy from Density Function Theory (DFT). Lastly, we show that conditional generation with UniMat can scale to previously established crystal datasets with up to millions of crystals structures, outperforming random structure search (the current leading method for structure discovery) in discovering new stable materials.</p>

    <p>The discovery of new functional and stable materials is a big challenge due
to its complexity. This work aims at the generation of new crystal structures
with desired properties, such as chemical stability and specified chemical
composition, by using machine learning generative models. Compared to the
generation of molecules, crystal structures pose new difficulties arising from
the periodic nature of the crystal and from the specific symmetry constraints
related to the space group. In this work, score-based probabilistic models
based on annealed Langevin dynamics, which have shown excellent performance in
various applications, are adapted to the task of crystal generation. The
novelty of the presented approach resides in the fact that the lattice of the
crystal cell is not fixed. During the training of the model, the lattice is
learned from the available data, whereas during the sampling of a new chemical
structure, two denoising processes are used in parallel to generate the lattice
along the generation of the atomic positions. A multigraph crystal
representation is introduced that respects symmetry constraints, yielding
computational advantages and a better quality of the sampled structures. We
show that our model is capable of generating new candidate structures in any
chosen chemical system and crystal group without any additional training. To
illustrate the functionality of the proposed method, a comparison of our model
to other recent generative models, based on descriptor-based metrics, is
provided.</p>

    <p>Accelerating material discovery holds the potential to greatly help mitigate
the climate crisis. Discovering new solid-state materials such as
electrocatalysts, super-ionic conductors or photovoltaic materials can have a
crucial impact, for instance, in improving the efficiency of renewable energy
production and storage. In this paper, we introduce Crystal-GFN, a generative
model of crystal structures that sequentially samples structural properties of
crystalline materials, namely the space group, composition and lattice
parameters. This domain-inspired approach enables the flexible incorporation of
physical and structural hard constraints, as well as the use of any available
predictive model of a desired physicochemical property as an objective
function. To design stable materials, one must target the candidates with the
lowest formation energy. Here, we use as objective the formation energy per
atom of a crystal structure predicted by a new proxy machine learning model
trained on MatBench. The results demonstrate that Crystal-GFN is able to sample
highly diverse crystals with low (median -3.1 eV/atom) predicted formation
energy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Equivariant graph neural networks force fields (EGraFFs) have shown great
promise in modelling complex interactions in atomic systems by exploiting the
graphs' inherent symmetries. Recent works have led to a surge in the
development of novel architectures that incorporate equivariance-based
inductive biases alongside architectural innovations like graph transformers
and message passing to model atomic interactions. However, thorough evaluations
of these deploying EGraFFs for the downstream task of real-world atomistic
simulations, is lacking. To this end, here we perform a systematic benchmarking
of 6 EGraFF algorithms (NequIP, Allegro, BOTNet, MACE, Equiformer, TorchMDNet),
with the aim of understanding their capabilities and limitations for realistic
atomistic simulations. In addition to our thorough evaluation and analysis on
eight existing datasets based on the benchmarking literature, we release two
new benchmark datasets, propose four new metrics, and three challenging tasks.
The new datasets and tasks evaluate the performance of EGraFF to
out-of-distribution data, in terms of different crystal structures,
temperatures, and new molecules. Interestingly, evaluation of the EGraFF models
based on dynamic simulations reveals that having a lower error on energy or
force does not guarantee stable or reliable simulation or faithful replication
of the atomic structures. Moreover, we find that no model clearly outperforms
other models on all datasets and tasks. Importantly, we show that the
performance of all the models on out-of-distribution datasets is unreliable,
pointing to the need for the development of a foundation model for force fields
that can be used in real-world simulations. In summary, this work establishes a
rigorous framework for evaluating machine learning force fields in the context
of atomic simulations and points to open research challenges within this
domain.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Due to the vast chemical space, discovering materials with a specific
function is challenging. Chemical formulas are obligated to conform to a set of
exacting criteria such as charge neutrality, balanced electronegativity,
synthesizability, and mechanical stability. In response to this formidable
task, we introduce a deep learning-based generative model for material
composition and structure design by learning and exploiting explicit and
implicit chemical knowledge. Our pipeline first uses deep diffusion language
models as the generator of compositions and then applies a template-based
crystal structure prediction algorithm to predict their corresponding
structures, which is then followed by structure relaxation using a universal
graph neural network-based potential. The density functional theory (DFT)
calculations of the formation energies and energy-above-the-hull analysis are
used to validate new structures generated through our pipeline. Based on the
DFT calculation results, six new materials, including Ti2HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,
TaReO4, HfTiO2, and HfMnO2, with formation energy less than zero have been
found. Remarkably, among these, four materials, namely Ti2$HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,
and TaReO4, exhibit an e-above-hull energy of less than 0.3 eV. These findings
have proved the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

    <p>Materials design has traditionally evolved through trial-error approaches,
mainly due to the non-local relationship between microstructures and properties
such as strength and toughness. We propose 'alloy informatics' as a machine
learning based prototype predictive approach for alloys and compounds, using
electron charge density profiles derived from first-principle calculations. We
demonstrate this framework in the case of hydrogen interstitials in
face-centered cubic crystals, showing that their differential electron charge
density profiles capture crystal properties and defect-crystal interaction
properties. Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) of defect-induced differential
charge density perturbations highlight the resulting screening effect, and,
together with hydrogen Bader charges, strongly correlate to a large set of
atomic properties of the metal species forming the bulk crystal. We observe the
spontaneous emergence of classes of charge responses while coarse-graining over
crystal compositions. Nudge-Elastic-Band calculations show that RDFs and charge
features also connect to hydrogen migration energy barriers between
interstitial sites. Unsupervised machine-learning on RDFs supports
classification, unveiling compositional and configurational non-localities in
the similarities of the perturbed densities. Electron charge density
perturbations may be considered as bias-free descriptors for a large variety of
defects.</p>

    <p>We review the topological gauge theory of Josephson junction arrays and thin film superconductors, stressing the role of the usually forgotten quantum phase slips, and we derive their quantum phase structure. A quantum phase transition from a superconducting to the dual, superinsulating phase with infinite resistance (even at finite temperatures) is either direct or goes through an intermediate bosonic topological insulator phase, which is typically also called Bose metal. We show how, contrary to a widely held opinion, disorder is not relevant for the electric response in these quantum phases because excitations in the spectrum are either symmetry-protected or neutral due to confinement. The quantum phase transitions are driven only by the electric interaction growing ever stronger. First, this prevents Bose condensation, upon which out-of-condensate charges and vortices form a topological quantum state owing to mutual statistics interactions. Then, at even stronger couplings, an electric flux tube dual to Abrikosov vortices induces a linearly confining potential between charges, giving rise to superinsulation.</p>

    <p>The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is an antisymmetric exchange interaction, which is responsible for the formation of topologically protected spin textures in chiral magnets. Here, by measuring the dispersion relation of the DM energy, we quantify the atomistic DMI in a model system, i.e., a Co double layer on Ir(001). We unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a chirality-inverted DMI, i.e., a sign change in the chirality index of DMI from negative to positive, when comparing the interaction between nearest neighbors to that between neighbors located at longer distances. The effect is in analogy to the change in the character of the Heisenberg exchange interaction from, e.g., ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic. We show that the pattern of the atomistic DMI in epitaxial magnetic structures can be very complex and provide critical insights into the nature of DMI. We anticipate that the observed effect is general and occurs in many magnetic nanostructures grown on heavy-element metallic substrates.</p>

Helicity-resolved steady-state photoluminescence (PL) reveals no optical degree of polarization. Time-resolved PL shows a photocarrier lifetime on the order of nanoseconds. From simultaneaously recorded time-resolved differential reflectivity (TR$Œî$R) and time-resolved Kerr ellipticity (TRKE), a photocarrier lifetime of a few nanoseconds and a spin dephasing time on the order of picoseconds was found. This stark contrast in lifetimes clearly explains the lack of spin polarization in steady-state PL. While we observe clear temperature-dependent effects on the PL dynamics that can be related to structural dynamics, the spin dephasing is nearly T-independent. Our results highlight that spin dephasing in 2D (BA)(MA)PbI occurs at time scales faster than the exciton recombination time, which poses a bottleneck for applications aimingto utilize this degree of freedom.</p>

    <p>The dimensionality of quantum materials strongly affects their physical
properties. Although many emergent phenomena, such as charge-density wave and
Luttinger liquid behavior, are well understood in one-dimensional (1D) systems,
the generalization to explore them in higher dimensional systems is still a
challenging task. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by systematically
investigating the crystal and electronic structures of molybdenum-oxide family
compounds, where the contexture of 1D chains facilitates rich emergent
properties. While the quasi-1D chains in these materials share general
similarities, such as the motifs made up of MoO6 octahedrons, they exhibit vast
complexity and remarkable tunability. We disassemble the 1D chains in
molybdenum oxides with different dimensions and construct effective models to
excellently fit their low-energy electronic structures obtained by ab initio
calculations. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of such chains on other
physical properties of the materials and the practical significance of the
effective models. Our work establishes the molybdenum oxides as simple and
tunable model systems for studying and manipulating the dimensionality in

    <p>Nanomechanical resonances of two-dimensional (2D) materials are sensitive probes for condensed-matter physics, offering new insights into magnetic and electronic phase transitions. Despite extensive research, the influence of the spin dynamics near a second-order phase transition on the nonlinear dynamics of 2D membranes has remained largely unexplored. Here, we investigate nonlinear magneto-mechanical coupling to antiferromagnetic order in suspended FePS$_3$-based heterostructure membranes. By monitoring the motion of these membranes as a function of temperature, we observe characteristic features in both nonlinear stiffness and damping close to the N√©el temperature $T_{\rm{N}}$. We account for these experimental observations with an analytical magnetostriction model in which these nonlinearities emerge from a coupling between mechanical and magnetic oscillations, demonstrating that magneto-elasticity can lead to nonlinear damping. Our findings thus provide insights into the thermodynamics and magneto-mechanical energy dissipation mechanisms in nanomechanical resonators due to the material's phase change and magnetic order relaxation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this paper, we have investigated, using finite element calculations, the
effect of initial texture on the formation of multiple necking patterns in
ductile metallic rings subjected to rapid radial expansion. The mechanical
behavior of the material has been modeled with the elasto-viscoplastic single
crystal constitutive model developed by \citet{marin2006}. The polycrystalline
microstructure of the ring has been generated using random Voronoi seeds. Both
$5000$ grain and $15000$ grain aggregates have been investigated, and for each
polycrystalline aggregate three different spatial distributions of grains have
been considered. The calculations have been performed within a wide range of
strain rates varying from $1.66 \cdot 10^4 ~ \text{s}^{-1}$ to $3.33 \cdot 10^5
~ \text{s}^{-1}$, and the rings have been modeled with four different initial
textures: isotropic texture, $\left\langle 001\right\rangle\parallel\Theta$
Goss texture, $\left\langle 001\right\rangle\parallel$ R Goss texture and
$\left\langle 111\right\rangle\parallel$ Z fiber texture. The finite element
results show that: (i) the spatial distribution of grains affects the location
of the necks, (ii) the decrease of the grain size delays the formation of the
necking pattern and increases the number of necks, (iii) the initial texture
affects the number of necks, the location of the necks, and the necking time,
(iv) the development of the necks is accompanied by a local increase of the
slip activity. This work provides new insights into the effect of
crystallographic microstructure on dynamic plastic localization and guidelines
to tailor the initial texture in order to delay dynamic necking formation and,
thus, to improve the energy absorption capacity of ductile metallic materials
at high strain rates.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>MoS2 nanostructures are promising catalysts for proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to replace expensive noble metals. Their broadscale application demands high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as robust durability. Doping is commonly applied to enhance the HER activity of MoS2-based nanocatalysts, but the effect of dopants in the electrochemical and structural stability is yet to be discussed. Herein, we correlate operando electrochemical measurements to the structural evolution of the materials down to the nanometric scale by identical location electron microscopy and spectroscopy. The range of stable operation for MoS2 nanocatalysts with and without rhenium doping is experimentally defined. The responsible degradation mechanisms at first electrolyte contact, open circuit stabilization and HER conditions are experimentally identified and confirmed with the calculated Pourbaix diagram of Re-doped MoS2. Doping MoS2-based nanocatalysts is validated as a promising strategy for the continuous improvement of high performance and durable PEM electrolyzers.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The 5d pyrochlore oxide superconductor Cd2Re2O7 (CRO) has attracted significant interest as a spin-orbit-coupled metal (SOCM) that spontaneously undergoes a phase transition to an odd-parity multipole phase by breaking the spatial inversion symmetry due to the Fermi liquid instability caused by strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite the significance of structural information during the transition, previous experimental results regarding lattice deformation have been elusive. We have conducted ultra-high resolution synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction experiments on a high-quality CRO single crystal. The temperature-dependent splitting of the 0 0 16 and 0 0 14 reflections, which are allowed and forbidden, respectively, in the high-temperature cubic phase I (space group Fd-3m), has been clearly observed and reveals the following significant facts: inversion symmetry breaking and tetragonal distortion occur simultaneously at Ts1 = 201.5(1) K; the previously believed first-order transition between phase II (I-4m2) and phase III (I4122) at Ts2 ~ 120 K consists of two close second-order transitions at Ts2 = 115.4(1) K and Ts3 ~ 100 K; there is a new orthorhombic phase XI (F222) in between. The order parameters (OPs) of these continuous transitions are uniquely represented by a two-dimensional irreducible representation Eu of the Oh point group, and the OPs of phase XI are a linear combination of those of phases II and III. Each phase is believed to correspond to a distinct odd-parity multipole order, and the complex successive transitions observed may be the result of an electronic phase transition that resolves the Fermi liquid instability in the SOCM.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The interplay between entropy transport and charge carriers-paramagnon interaction in the Onsager linear system has been a subject of debate due to the limited theoretical and experimental understanding of paramagnon heat capacity. In this study, we investigate this interplay in an anisotropic layered magnetic system using cluster mean-field theory with spin quantum correlations. By examining spin correlation functions between different spins with various types of clustering, we derive the spin correlation function as a function of distance and temperature for the inter-layer clusters both below and above the magnetic order phase transition. Our analysis reveals that paramagnons characterized by pronounced spin correlations among inter-layer nearest-neighbor spins exhibit a non-zero heat capacity, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of entropy transport. The findings align with experimental observations, lending strong support to the validity of the paramagnon drag thermopower concept. This study sheds light on the intricate dynamics and thermodynamic properties of paramagnons, advancing our understanding of entropy transport in complex systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is a spinel based on magnetic V$^{3+}$ ions which host both spin ($S=1$) and orbital ($l_{eff}=1$) moments. Owing to the underlying pyrochlore coordination of the magnetic sites, the spins in MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ only antiferromagnetically order once the frustrating interactions imposed by the $Fd\overline{3}m$ lattice are broken through an orbitally-driven structural distortion at T$_{S}$ $\simeq$ 60 K. Consequently, a N√©el transition occurs at T$_{N}$ $\simeq$ 40 K. Low temperature spatial ordering of the electronic orbitals is fundamental to both the structural and magnetic properties, however considerable discussion on whether it can be described by complex or real orbital ordering is ambiguous. We apply neutron spectroscopy to resolve the nature of the orbital ground state and characterize hysteretic spin-orbital correlations using x-ray and neutron diffraction. Neutron spectroscopy finds multiple excitation bands and we parameterize these in terms of a multi-level (or excitonic) theory based on the orbitally degenerate ground state. Meaningful for the orbital ground state, we report an "optical-like" mode at high energies that we attribute to a crystal-field-like excitation from the spin-orbital $j_{eff}$=2 ground state manifold to an excited $j_{eff}$=1 energy level. We parameterize the magnetic excitations in terms of a Hamiltonian with spin-orbit coupling and local crystalline electric field distortions resulting from deviations from perfect octahedra surrounding the V$^{3+}$ ions. We suggest that this provides compelling evidence for complex orbital order in MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. We then apply the consequences of this model to understand hysteretic effects in the magnetic diffuse scattering where we propose that MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ displays a high temperature orbital memory of the low temperature spin order.</p>

    <p>While crystal structure prediction (CSP) remains a longstanding challenge, we
introduce ParetoCSP, a novel algorithm for CSP, which combines a
multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) with a neural network inter-atomic
potential (IAP) model to find energetically optimal crystal structures given
chemical compositions. We enhance the NSGA-III algorithm by incorporating the
genotypic age as an independent optimization criterion and employ the M3GNet
universal IAP to guide the GA search. Compared to GN-OA, a state-of-the-art
neural potential based CSP algorithm, ParetoCSP demonstrated significantly
better predictive capabilities, outperforming by a factor of $2.562$ across
$55$ diverse benchmark structures, as evaluated by seven performance metrics.
Trajectory analysis of the traversed structures of all algorithms shows that
ParetoCSP generated more valid structures than other algorithms, which helped
guide the GA to search more effectively for the optimal structures</p>

II-VI zinc blende (ZB) semiconductors, powered by crystal Graph-based Neural
Networks (GNNs) trained on high-throughput density functional theory (DFT)

configurations from DFT calculations, we generate one of the largest
computational defect datasets to date, containing many types of vacancies,
self-interstitials, anti-site substitutions, impurity interstitials and
substitutions, as well as some defect complexes. We applied three types of
established GNN techniques, namely Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network
(CGCNN), Materials Graph Network (MEGNET), and Atomistic Line Graph Neural
Network (ALIGNN), to rigorously train models for predicting defect formation
energy (DFE) in multiple charge states and chemical potential conditions. We
find that ALIGNN yields the best DFE predictions with root mean square errors
around 0.3 eV, which represents a prediction accuracy of 98 % given the range
of values within the dataset, improving significantly on the state-of-the-art.
Models are tested for different defect types as well as for defect charge
transition levels. We further show that GNN-based defective structure
optimization can take us close to DFT-optimized geometries at a fraction of the
cost of full DFT. DFT-GNN models enable prediction and screening across
thousands of hypothetical defects based on both unoptimized and
partially-optimized defective structures, helping identify electronically

Machine Learning (MatSci ML) methods focused on solid-state materials with

materials is a nascent field with substantial fragmentation largely driven by
the great variety of datasets used to develop machine learning models. This
fragmentation makes comparing the performance and generalizability of different

Building on top of open-source datasets, including large-scale datasets like
the OpenCatalyst, OQMD, NOMAD, the Carolina Materials Database, and Materials
Project, the MatSci ML benchmark provides a diverse set of materials systems
and properties data for model training and evaluation, including simulated

crystal symmetries via space groups. The diversity of properties in MatSci ML
makes the implementation and evaluation of multi-task learning algorithms for
solid-state materials possible, while the diversity of datasets facilitates the
development of new, more generalized algorithms and methods across multiple
datasets. In the multi-dataset learning setting, MatSci ML enables researchers
to combine observations from multiple datasets to perform joint prediction of
common properties, such as energy and forces. Using MatSci ML, we evaluate the

    <p>Freestanding tubular crystals offer a general description of crystalline
order on deformable surfaces with cylindrical topology, such as single-walled
carbon nanotubes, microtubules, and recently reported colloidal assemblies.
These systems exhibit a rich interplay between the crystal's helicity on its
periodic surface, the deformable geometry of that surface, and the motions of
topological defects within the crystal. Previously, in simulations of tubular
crystals as elastic networks, we found that dislocations in nontrivial patterns
can co-stabilize with kinks in the tube shape, producing mechanical
multistability. Here, we extend that work with detailed Langevin dynamics
simulations, in order to explore defect dynamics efficiently and without the
constraints imposed by elastic network models. Along with the predicted
multistability of dislocation glide, we find a variety of irreversible defect
transformations, including vacancy formation, particle extrusions, and
"reactions" that reorient dislocation pairs. Moreover, we report spontaneous
sequences of several such defect transformations, which are unique to tubular
crystals. We demonstrate a simple method for controlling these sequences
through a time-varying external force.</p>

    <p>We propose a protocol to realize synthetic $p_x+ip_y$ superconductors in one-dimensional topological systems that host Majorana fermions. By periodically driving a localized Majorana mode across the system, our protocol realizes a topological pumping of Majorana fermions, analogous to the adiabatic Thouless pumping of electrical charges. Importantly, similar to the realization of a Chern insulator through Thouless pumping, we show that pumping of Majorana zero modes could lead to a $p_x + ip_y$ superconductor in the two dimensions of space and synthetic time. The Floquet theory is employed to map the driven one-dimensional system to a two-dimensional synthetic system by considering frequency as a new dimension. We demonstrate such Floquet $p_x + i p_y$ superconductors using the Kitaev $p$-wave superconductor chain, a prototypical 1D topological system, as well as its more realistic realization in the 1D Kondo lattice model as examples. We further show the appearance of a new $œÄ$ Majorana mode at the Floquet zone boundary in an intermediate drive frequency region. Our work suggests a driven magnetic spiral coupled to a superconductor as a promising platform for the realization of novel topological superconductors.</p>

    <p>This letter presents a novel approach for identifying uncorrelated atomic configurations from extensive data sets with a non-standard neural network workflow known as random network distillation (RND) for training machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLPs). This method is coupled with a DFT workflow wherein initial data is generated with cheaper classical methods before only the minimal subset is passed to a more computationally expensive ab initio calculation. This benefits training not only by reducing the number of expensive DFT calculations required but also by providing a pathway to the use of more accurate quantum mechanical calculations for training. The method's efficacy is demonstrated by constructing machine-learned inter-atomic potentials for the molten salts KCl and NaCl. Our RND method allows accurate models to be fit on minimal data sets, as small as 32 configurations, reducing the required structures by at least one order of magnitude compared to alternative methods.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a wide bandgap semiconductor material recently being used in replacement of traditional semiconductors for high-voltage power device applications. Radiation environments induce defects through displacement damage in the lattice that can saturate over periods of high energy particle exposure at various concentrations. Defects are characterized by the formation of vacancies, interstitials and Frenkel pairs. Using molecular dynamics software we calculate thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) over and specific heat capacity at constant volume ($c_v$) values over a temperature range varying defect concentrations in single crystal 4H-SiC. At a discovered critical defect density amorphous defect clusters form in the lattice triggering macroscopic negative thermal expansion across the entire temperature range. Exponential $c_v$ loss is observed as defect density increases until the isothermal process becomes completely adiabatic at a identified critical Frenkel pair concentration. Providing insight to the degradation of SiC from displacement damage effects can ultimately assist the development of radiation-hardened electronics.</p>

    <p>Solution-processed two-dimensional (2D) materials hold promise for their scalable applications. However, the random, fragmented nature of the solution-processed nanoflakes and the poor percolative conduction through their discrete networks limit the performance of the enabled devices. To overcome the problem, we report conduction modulation of the solution-processed 2D materials via the Stark effect. Using liquid-phase exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as an example, we demonstrate nonlinear conduction modulation with a switching ratio of >105 by the local fields from the interfacial ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE). Through density-functional theory calculations and in situ Raman scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopic analysis, we understand the modulation arises from a charge redistribution in the solution-processed MoS2. Beyond MoS2, we show the modulation may be viable for the other solution-processed 2D materials and low-dimensional materials. The effective modulation can open their electronic device applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly popular for predicting
material properties to accelerate materials discovery. Because material
properties are strongly affected by its crystal structure, a key issue is
converting the crystal structure into the features for input to the ML model.
Currently, the most common method is to convert the crystal structure into a
graph and predicting its properties using a graph neural network (GNN). Some
GNN models, such as crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) and
atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN), have achieved highly accurate
predictions of material properties. Despite these successes, using a graph to
represent a crystal structure has the notable limitation of losing the crystal
structure's three-dimensional (3D) information. In this work, we propose
DeepCrysTet, a novel deep learning approach for predicting material properties,
which uses crystal structures represented as a 3D tetrahedral mesh generated by
Delaunay tetrahedralization. DeepCrysTet provides a useful framework that
includes a 3D mesh generation method, mesh-based feature design, and neural
network design. The experimental results using the Materials Project dataset
show that DeepCrysTet significantly outperforms existing GNN models in
classifying crystal structures and achieves state-of-the-art performance in
predicting elastic properties.</p>

    <p>Moir√© potential acts as periodic quantum confinement for optically generated exciton, generating spatially ordered zero-dimensional quantum system. However, broad emission spectrum arising from inhomogeneity among moir√© potential hinders the exploration of the intrinsic properties of moir√© exciton. In this study, we have demonstrated a new method to realize the optical observation of quantum coherence and interference of a single moir√© exciton in twisted semiconducting heterobilayer beyond the diffraction limit of light. A significant single and sharp photoluminescence peak from a single moir√© exciton has been demonstrated after nano-fabrication. We present the longer duration of quantum coherence of a single moir√© exciton, which reaches beyond 10 ps and the accelerated decoherence process with elevating temperature and excitation power density. Moreover, the quantum interference has revealed the coupling between moir√© excitons in different moir√© potential minima. The observed quantum coherence and interference of moir√© exciton will facilitate potential application toward quantum technologies based on moir√© quantum systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In the last decades, material discovery has been a very active research field
driven by the need to find new materials for many different applications. This
has also included materials with heavy elements, beyond the stable isotopes of
lead, as most actinides exhibit unique properties that make them useful in
various applications. Furthermore, new heavy elements beyond actinides,
collectively referred to as super-heavy elements (SHEs), have been synthesized,
filling previously empty space of Mendeleev periodic table. Their chemical
bonding behavior, of academic interest at present, would also benefit of
state-of-the-art modeling approaches. In particular, in order to perform
first-principles calculations with planewave basis sets, one needs
corresponding pseudopotentials. In this work, we present a series of scalar-
and fully-relativistic optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials
(ONCVPs) for thirty-four actinides and super-heavy elements, for three
different exchange-correlation functionals (PBE, PBEsol and LDA). The
scalar-relativistic version of these ONCVPs is tested by comparing equations of
states for crystals, obtained with \textsc{abinit} 9.6, with those obtained by
all-electron zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) calculations, without
spin-orbit coupling, performed with the Amsterdam Modeling Suite \textsc{band}
code. $\Delta$-Gauge and $\Delta_1$-Gauge indicators are used to validate these
pseudopotentials. This work is a contribution to the PseudoDojo project, in
which pseudopotentials for the whole periodic table are developed and
systematically tested. The pseudopotential files are available on the
PseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org in psp8 and UPF2 formats, both
suitable for \textsc{abinit}, the latter being also suitable for Quantum
ESPRESSO.</p>

    <p>Ordered electronic states have been extensively explored in cuprates and iron-based unconventional superconductors, but seldom observed in the epitaxial FeSe/SrTiO3(001) monolayer (FeSe/STO) with an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc). Here, by using scanning tunneling microscopy/ spectroscopy (STM/STS), we reveal a checkerboard charge order in the epitaxial FeSe/STO monolayer, with a period of four times the inter-Fe-atom distance along two perpendicular directions of the Fe lattice. This ordered state is uniquely present in the superconducting FeSe/STO monolayer, even at liquid nitrogen temperature, but absent in the non-superconducting FeSe monolayer or bilayer. Quasiparticle interference (QPI) measurements further confirm it as a static order without an energy-dependent dispersion and gapped out within the superconductivity gap. The intensity of the charge order shows an enhancement near the superconducting transition temperature, thus implying a correlation with the high-Tc superconductivity in the FeSe/STO monolayer. This study provides a new basis for exploring the ordered electronic states and their interplay with high-Tc superconductivity in the FeSe monolayer.</p>

    <p>The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) in domain sciences necessitates
best practices and standardized benchmarking for performance evaluation. We
present Matbench Discovery, an evaluation framework for ML energy models,
applied as pre-filters for high-throughput searches of stable inorganic
crystals. This framework addresses the disconnect between thermodynamic
stability and formation energy, as well as retrospective vs. prospective
benchmarking in materials discovery. We release a Python package to support
model submissions and maintain an online leaderboard, offering insights into
performance trade-offs. To identify the best-performing ML methodologies for
materials discovery, we benchmarked various approaches, including random
forests, graph neural networks (GNNs), one-shot predictors, iterative Bayesian
optimizers, and universal interatomic potentials (UIP). Our initial results
rank models by test set F1 scores for thermodynamic stability prediction:
EquiformerV2 + DeNS > Orb > SevenNet > MACE > CHGNet > M3GNet > ALIGNN > MEGNet
> CGCNN > CGCNN+P > Wrenformer > BOWSR > Voronoi fingerprint random forest.
UIPs emerge as the top performers, achieving F1 scores of 0.57-0.82 and
discovery acceleration factors (DAF) of up to 6x on the first 10k stable
predictions compared to random selection. We also identify a misalignment
between regression metrics and task-relevant classification metrics. Accurate
regressors can yield high false-positive rates near the decision boundary at 0
eV/atom above the convex hull. Our results demonstrate UIPs' ability to
optimize computational budget allocation for expanding materials databases.
However, their limitations remain underexplored in traditional benchmarks. We
advocate for task-based evaluation frameworks, as implemented here, to address
these limitations and advance ML-guided materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A major challenge in the development of quantum technologies is to induce additional types of ferroic orders into materials that exhibit other useful quantum properties. Various techniques have been applied to this end, such as elastically straining, doping, or interfacing a compound with other materials. Plastic deformation introduces permanent topological defects and large local strains into a material, which can give rise to qualitatively new functionality. Here we show via local magnetic imaging that plastic deformation induces robust magnetism in the quantum paraelectric SrTiO3, in both conducting and insulating samples. Our analysis indicates that the magnetic order is localized along dislocation walls and coexists with polar order along the walls. The magnetic signals can be switched on and off in a controllable manner with external stress, which demonstrates that plastically deformed SrTiO3 is a quantum multiferroic. These results establish plastic deformation as a versatile platform for quantum materials engineering.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Motivated by unexpected reports of a 26 K superconducting transition in elemental titanium at high pressure, we carry out an accurate ab-initio study of its properties to understand the rationale for this observation. The critical superconducting temperatures (Tc's) predicted under the assumption of a phononic pairing mechanism are found to be significantly lower than those experimentally observed. We argue that this disagreement cannot be explained by an unconventional coupling, as previously suggested, or by the existence of competing metastable structural phases. As a physically meaningful hypothesis to reconcile experimental and theoretical results, we assume the presence of Ti vacancies in the lattice. Our first-principles calculations indeed show that lattice vacancies can cause pressure dependent phonon softening and substantially increase the electron-phonon coupling at high pressure, yielding computed Tc's in agreement with the experimental measurements over the full pressure range from 150 to 300 GPa. We expect the proposed Tc enhancement mechanism to occur on a general basis in simple high-symmetry metals for various types of defects.</p>

    <p>The study of moir√© engineering started with the advent of van der Waals heterostructures in which stacking two-dimensional layers with different lattice constants leads to a moir√© pattern controlling their electronic properties. The field entered a new era when it was found that adjusting the twist between two graphene layers led to strongly-correlated-electron physics and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. Twist is now used routinely to adjust the properties of two-dimensional materials. Here, we investigate a new type of moir√© superlattice in bilayer graphene when one layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other - so-called biaxial heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling electronic states associated with a novel symmetry-breaking atomic reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer. Tight-binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir√© engineering in van der Waals multilayers.</p>

    <p>Deformation plasticity mechanisms in alloys and compounds may unveil the
material capacity towards optimal mechanical properties. We conduct a series of
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate plasticity mechanisms due to
nanoindentation in pure tungsten, molybdenum and vanadium body-centered cubic
single crystals, as well as the also body-centered cubic, equiatomic, random
solid solutions (RSS) of tungsten--molybdenum and tungsten--vanadium alloys.
Our analysis focuses on a thorough, side-by-side comparison of dynamic
deformation processes, defect nucleation, and evolution, along with
corresponding stress--strain curves. We also check the surface morphology of
indented samples through atomic shear strain mapping. As expected, the presence
of Mo and V atoms in W matrices introduces lattice strain and distortion,
increasing material resistance to deformation and slowing down dislocation
mobility of dislocation loops with a Burgers vector of 1/2 $\langle 111
\rangle$. Our side-by-side comparison displays a remarkable suppression of the
plastic zone size in equiatomic W--V RSS, but not in equiatomic W--Mo RSS
alloys, displaying a clear prediction for optimal hardening response equiatomic
W--V RSS alloys. If the small-depth nanoindentation plastic response is
indicative of overall mechanical performance, it is possible to conceive a
novel MD-based pathway towards material design for mechanical applications in
complex, multi-component alloys.</p>

    <p>The recent discovery of a charge density wave order at the wave vector $P$ $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ has created a mystery because subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show a dominant phonon instability instead at another wave vector $H$ $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$. In this paper, I use first principles total energy calculations to map out the landscape of the structural distortions due to the unstable phonon modes at $H$, $L$ $(\frac{1}{2},0,\frac{1}{2})$, and $P$ present in this material. In agreement with previous results, I find that the distortions due to the $H$ instability cause the largest gain in energy relative to the parent structure, followed in order by the $L$ and $P$ instabilities. However, only two distinct structure occur due to this instability, which are separated by 6 meV/f.u. The instability at $L$ results in three distinct structures separated in energy by 5 meV/f.u. In contrast, six different distorted structures are stabilized due to the instability at $P$, and they all lie within 2 meV/f.u.\ of each other. Hence, despite a lower energy gain, the condensation at $P$ could be favorable due to a larger entropy gain associated with the fluctuations within a manifold with larger multiplicity via the order-by-disorder mechanism.</p>

    <p>In twisted MoTe$_{2}$, latest transport measurement has reported observation of quantum anomalous Hall effect at hole filling $ŒΩ=-1$, which undergoes a topological phase transition to a trivial ferromagnet as layer hybridization gets suppressed by interlayer bias $D$. Here we show that this underlies the existence of an orbital Chern insulating state with gate ($D$) switchable sign in an antiferromagtic spin background at hole filling $ŒΩ=-2$. From momentum-space Hartree Fock calculations, we find this state has a topological phase diagram complementary to that of the $ŒΩ=-1$ one: by sweeping $D$ from negative to positive, the Chern number of this $ŒΩ=-2$ state can be switched between $+1$, $0$, and $-1$, accompanied by a sign change of a sizable orbital magnetization. In range of $D$ where this antiferronagnet is the ground state, the orbital magnetization allows magnetic field initialization of the spin antiferromagnetic order and the Chern number.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In spinel-type nickelate NiRh$_2$O$_4$, magnetic ordering is observed upon the sample synthesized via kinetically controlled low-temperature solid-state metathesis, as opposed to previously-reported samples obtained through conventional solid-state reaction. Our findings are based on a combination of bulk susceptibility and specific heat measurements that disclose a N$√©$el transition temperature of $T_N$ = 45 K in this material, which might feature spin-orbit entanglement in the tetragonally-coordinated $d^8$ Mott insulators. The emergence of magnetic ordering upon alteration of the synthesis route indicates that the suppression of magnetic ordering in the previous sample was rooted in the cation-mixing assisted by the entropy gain that results from high-temperature reactions. Furthermore, the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 0 physics, instead of solely the spin-only $S = 1$, describes the observed enhancement of effective magnetic moment well. Overseeing all observations and speculations, we propose that the possible mechanism responsible for the emergent magnetic orderings in NiRh$_2$O$_4$ is the condensation of $J_{\rm eff}$ = 0 exciton, driven by the interplay of the tetragonal crystal field and superexchange interactions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The precise control of Weyl physics in realistic materials oers a promising
avenue to construct accessible topological quantum systems, and thus draw
widespread attention in condensed-matter physics. Here, based on rst-principles
calculations, maximally localized Wannier functions based tight-binding model,
and Floquet theorem, we study the light-manipulated evolution of Weyl physics
in a carbon allotrope C6 crystallizing a face-centered orthogonal structure
(fco-C6), an ideal Weyl semimetal with two pairs of Weyl nodes, under the
irradiation of a linearly polarized light (LPL). We show that the positions of
Weyl nodes and Fermi arcs can be accurately controlled by changing light
intensity. Moreover, we employ a low-energy eective k p model to understand
light-controllable Weyl physics. The results indicate that the symmetry of
light-irradiated fco-C6 can be selectively preserved, which guarantees that the
light-manipulated Weyl nodes can only move in the highsymmetry plane in
momentum space. Our work not only demonstrates the ecacy of employing periodic
driving light elds as an ecient approach to manipulate Weyl physics, but also
paves a reliable pathway for designing accessible topological states under
light irradiation.</p>

    <p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an essential technique to determine a material's
crystal structure in high-throughput experimentation, and has recently been
incorporated in artificially intelligent agents in autonomous scientific
discovery processes. However, rapid, automated and reliable analysis method of
XRD data matching the incoming data rate remains a major challenge. To address
these issues, we present CrystalShift, an efficient algorithm for probabilistic
XRD phase labeling that employs symmetry-constrained pseudo-refinement
optimization, best-first tree search, and Bayesian model comparison to estimate
probabilities for phase combinations without requiring phase space information
or training. We demonstrate that CrystalShift provides robust probability
estimates, outperforming existing methods on synthetic and experimental
datasets, and can be readily integrated into high-throughput experimental
workflows. In addition to efficient phase-mapping, CrystalShift offers
quantitative insights into materials' structural parameters, which facilitate
both expert evaluation and AI-based modeling of the phase space, ultimately
accelerating materials identification and discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The chemical exfoliation of non-van der Waals (vdW) materials to ultrathin
nanosheets remains a formidable challenge. This difficulty arises from the
strong preference of these materials to engage in three-dimensional chemical
bonding, resulting in uncontrolled atomic migration into the vdW gaps during
cation deintercalation from the bulk structure, ultimately leading to
unpredictable structural disorder. We propose a generic framework using neural
network potentials (NNPs) to accurately model the widespread nonstoichiometric
environments resulting from disordered atomic migrations during exfoliation of
non-vdW materials. We apply our framework to investigate the crystal structures
and phase transformations occurring during the exfoliation of non-vdW
nonstoichiometric Cr$_{(1-x)}$S systems, a compelling material category with
substantial potential for two-dimensional (2D) magnetic applications. The
efficacy of the NNP outperforms the conventional cluster expansion, exhibiting
superior accuracy and transferability to unexplored crystal structures and
compositions. By employing the NNP in simulated annealing optimizations, we
predict low-energy Cr$_{(1-x)}$S structures anticipated to result from
experimental synthesis. A notable structural transition is discerned at the
Cr$_{0.5}$S composition, with half of the Cr atoms preferentially migrating to
vdW gaps. This aligns with experimental observations in the chemical
exfoliation of 2D CrS$_2$, and emphasizes the vital role of excess Cr atoms
beyond the Cr/S = $1/2$ composition ratio in stabilizing vdW gaps.
Additionally, we utilize the NNP in a vacancy diffusion Monte Carlo simulation
to illustrate the impact of lateral compressive strains in catalyzing the
formation of vdW gaps within non-vdW CrS$_2$ slabs. This provides a direct
pathway for more facile exfoliation of ultrathin nanosheets from non-vdW
materials through strain engineering.</p>

    <p>Generative machine learning models can use data generated by scientific
modeling to create large quantities of novel material structures. Here, we
assess how one state-of-the-art generative model, the physics-guided crystal
generation model (PGCGM), can be used as part of the inverse design process. We
show that the default PGCGM's input space is not smooth with respect to
parameter variation, making material optimization difficult and limited. We
also demonstrate that most generated structures are predicted to be
thermodynamically unstable by a separate property-prediction model, partially
due to out-of-domain data challenges. Our findings suggest how generative
models might be improved to enable better inverse design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Infrared and Raman spectroscopies are ubiquitous techniques employed in many
experimental laboratories, thanks to their fast and non-destructive nature able
to capture materials' features as spectroscopic fingerprints. Nevertheless,
these measurements frequently need theoretical support in order to
unambiguously decipher and assign complex spectra. Linear-response theory
provides an effective way to obtain the higher-order derivatives needed, but
its applicability to modern exchange-correlation functionals remains limited.
Here, we devise an automated, open-source, user-friendly approach based on
ground-state density-functional theory and the electric enthalpy functional to
allow seamless calculations of first-principles infrared and Raman spectra. By
employing a finite-displacement and finite-field approach, we allow for the use
of any functional, as well as an efficient treatment of large low-symmetry
structures. Additionally, we propose a simple scheme for efficiently sampling
the Brillouin zone with different electric fields. To demonstrate the
capabilities of our approach, we provide illustrations using the ferroelectric
LiNbO$_3$ crystal as a paradigmatic example. We predict infrared and Raman
spectra using various (semi)local, Hubbard corrected, and hybrid functionals.
Our results also show how PBE0 and extended Hubbard functionals yield in this
case the best match in term of peak positions and intensities, respectively.</p>

symmetry. We analyze the geometry of the experimental tiling and discuss
factors relevant for the stabilization of the quasicrystal. Our joint

    <p>The crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) is a machine learning
model that leverages score matching to generate realistic crystal structures
that preserve crystal symmetry. In this study, we leverage novel diffusion
probabilistic (DP) models to denoise atomic coordinates rather than adopting
the standard score matching approach in CDVAE. Our proposed DP-CDVAE model can
reconstruct and generate crystal structures whose qualities are statistically
comparable to those of the original CDVAE. Furthermore, notably, when comparing
the carbon structures generated by the DP-CDVAE model with relaxed structures
obtained from density functional theory calculations, we find that the DP-CDVAE
generated structures are remarkably closer to their respective ground states.
The energy differences between these structures and the true ground states are,
on average, 68.1 meV/atom lower than those generated by the original CDVAE.
This significant improvement in the energy accuracy highlights the
effectiveness of the DP-CDVAE model in generating crystal structures that
better represent their ground-state configurations.</p>

    <p>We present a high-throughput, end-to-end pipeline for organic crystal
structure prediction (CSP) -- the problem of identifying the stable crystal
structures that will form from a given molecule based only on its molecular
composition. Our tool uses Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) to allow for
efficient screening and structural relaxations of generated crystal candidates.
Our pipeline consists of two distinct stages -- random search, whereby crystal
candidates are randomly generated and screened, and optimization, where a
genetic algorithm (GA) optimizes this screened population. We assess the
performance of each stage of our pipeline on 21 molecules taken from the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre's CSP blind tests. We show that random
search alone yields matches for $\approx 50\%$ of targets. We then validate the
potential of our full pipeline, making use of the GA to optimize the Root
Mean-Squared Deviation (RMSD) between crystal candidates and the experimentally
derived structure. With this approach, we are able to find matches for
$\approx80\%$ of candidates with 10-100 times smaller initial population sizes
than when using random search. Lastly, we run our full pipeline with an ANI
model that is trained on a small dataset of molecules extracted from crystal
structures in the Cambridge Structural Database, generating $\approx 60\%$ of
targets. By leveraging ML models trained to predict energies at the DFT level,
our pipeline has the potential to approach the accuracy of \emph{ab initio}
methods and the efficiency of empirical force-fields.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) is crucial in various scientific
disciplines. While CSP can be addressed by employing currently-prevailing
generative models (e.g. diffusion models), this task encounters unique
challenges owing to the symmetric geometry of crystal structures -- the
invariance of translation, rotation, and periodicity. To incorporate the above
symmetries, this paper proposes DiffCSP, a novel diffusion model to learn the
structure distribution from stable crystals. To be specific, DiffCSP jointly
generates the lattice and atom coordinates for each crystal by employing a
periodic-E(3)-equivariant denoising model, to better model the crystal
geometry. Notably, different from related equivariant generative approaches,
DiffCSP leverages fractional coordinates other than Cartesian coordinates to
represent crystals, remarkably promoting the diffusion and the generation
process of atom positions. Extensive experiments verify that our DiffCSP
significantly outperforms existing CSP methods, with a much lower computation
cost in contrast to DFT-based methods. Moreover, the superiority of DiffCSP is
also observed when it is extended for ab initio crystal generation.</p>

    <p>Why are materials with specific characteristics more abundant than others?
This is a fundamental question in materials science and one that is
traditionally difficult to tackle, given the vastness of compositional and
configurational space. We highlight here the anomalous abundance of inorganic
compounds whose primitive unit cell contains a number of atoms that is a
multiple of four. This occurrence - named here the 'rule of four' - has to our
knowledge not previously been reported or studied. Here, we first highlight the
rule's existence, especially notable when restricting oneself to experimentally
known compounds, and explore its possible relationship with established
descriptors of crystal structures, from symmetries to energies. We then
investigate this relative abundance by looking at structural descriptors, both
of global (packing configurations) and local (the smooth overlap of atomic
positions) nature. Contrary to intuition, the overabundance does not correlate
with low-energy or high-symmetry structures; in fact, structures which obey the
'rule of four' are characterized by low symmetries and loosely packed
arrangements maximizing the free volume. We are able to correlate this
abundance with local structural symmetries, and visualize the results using a
hybrid supervised-unsupervised machine learning method.</p>

    <p>It is far well accepted that the morphology of nanoparticles and nanoalloys is of paramount importance to understand their properties. Furthemore, the morphology depends on the growth mechanism with coalescence generally accepted as one the most common mechanisms both in liquid and in the gas phase. Coalescence refers when two existing seeds collide and aggregate into a larger object. It is expected that the resulting aggregate shows a compact, often spherical structure, although strongly out of the equilibrium, referring to its global minimum. While the coalescence of liquid droplet is widely studied, the first stages of the coalescence between nanoseeds has attracted less interest, although important as multiple aggregation can take place. Here we simulate the coalescence of Au and Pd seeds by the Molecular Dynamics method, comparing the initial stage of the coalescence in vacuum and when there is an interacting surrounding around them. We show that the surface chemical composition of the resulting aggregate depend on the environment as well as the overall morphology.</p>

    <p>Quasicrystal (QC) has no periodicity but has a unique rotational symmetry forbidden in periodic crystals. Lack of microscopic theory of the crystalline electric field (CEF) in the QC and approximant crystal (AC) has prevented us from understanding the electric property, especially the magnetism. By developing the general formulation of the CEF in the rare-earth based QC and AC, we have analyzed the CEF in the QC Au-SM-Tb and AC (SM=Si, Ge, and Ga). The magnetic anisotropy arising from the CEF plays an important role in realizing unique magnetic states on the icosahedron (IC). By constructing the minimal model with the magnetic anisotropy, we have analyzed the ground-state properties of the IC, 1/1 AC, and QC. The hedgehog state is characterized by the topological charge of one and the whirling-moment state is characterized by the topological charge of three. The uniform arrangement of the ferrimagnetic state is stabilized in the QC with the ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, which is a candidate for the magnetic structure recently observed FM long-range order in the QC Au-Ga-Tb. The uniform arrangement of the hedgehog state is stabilized in the QC with the antiferromagnetic interaction, which suggests the possibility of the topological magnetic long-range order.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this manuscript, after discussing in detail the internals of our recently
developed method, the dynamical projective operatorial approach (DPOA), we
provide the framework to apply this method to pumped semiconductor lattice
systems and, in particular, to study and analyze their electronic excitations
and TR-ARPES signal. The expressions for relevant out-of-equilibrium Green's
functions and TR-ARPES signal are given within the DPOA framework and, defining
a retarded TR-ARPES signal, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an
out-of-equilibrium version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We clarify
how single- and multi-photon resonances, rigid shifts, band dressings, and
different types of sidebands emerge in the TR-ARPES signal. We also propose
protocols for evaluating the strength of single- and multi-photon resonances
and for assigning the residual excited electronic population at each crystal
momentum and band to a specific excitation process. Hamiltonians, where intra-
and inter-band transitions are selectively inhibited, are defined and used to
analyze the effects on the TR-ARPES signal and the residual electronic excited
population. Three relevant cases of light-matter coupling are examined within
the dipole gauge: only a local dipole, only the Peierls substitution in the

are studied in detail, including the consequences of the lattice symmetries at
different crystal momenta on the TR-ARPES signal. A detailed study of the
dependence of the TR-ARPES signal on the probe-pulse characteristics is also
reported. To provide a guideline for understanding the complex effects and
interplays and the variety of possible physical phenomena without being limited
by the characteristics of a single particular real material, we have chosen to
study a prototypical pumped two-band semiconductor lattice system.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accurately predicting the elastic properties of crystalline solids is vital
for computational materials science. However, traditional atomistic scale ab
initio approaches are computationally intensive, especially for studying
complex materials with a large number of atoms in a unit cell. We introduce a
novel data-driven approach to efficiently predict the elastic properties of
crystal structures using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). This
approach yields important scalar elastic moduli with the accuracy comparable to
recent data-driven studies. Importantly, our symmetry-aware GNNs model also
enables the prediction of the strain energy density (SED) and the associated
elastic constants, the fundamental tensorial quantities that are significantly
influenced by a material's crystallographic group. The model consistently
distinguishes independent elements of SED tensors, in accordance with the
symmetry of the crystal structures. Finally, our deep learning model possesses
meaningful latent features, offering an interpretable prediction of the elastic
properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials discovery, especially for applications that require extreme
operating conditions, requires extensive testing that naturally limits the
ability to inquire the wealth of possible compositions. Machine Learning (ML)
has nowadays a well established role in facilitating this effort in systematic
ways. The increasing amount of available accurate DFT data represents a solid
basis upon which new ML models can be trained and tested. While conventional
models rely on static descriptors, generally suitable for a limited class of
systems, the flexibility of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) allows for direct
learning representations on graphs, such as the ones formed by crystals. We
utilize crystal graph neural networks (CGNN) to predict crystal properties with
DFT level accuracy, through graphs with encoding of the atomic (node/vertex),
bond (edge), and global state attributes. In this work, we aim at testing the
ability of the CGNN MegNet framework in predicting a number of properties of
systems previously unseen from the model, obtained by adding a substitutional
defect in bulk crystals that are included in the training set. We perform DFT
validation to assess the accuracy in the prediction of formation energies and
structural features (such as elastic moduli). Using CGNNs, one may identify
promising paths in alloy discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Modification of titanium microstructure after propagation of a melting shock wave (SW) generated by a femtosecond laser pulse is investigated experimentally and analyzed using hydrodynamic and atomistic simulations. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy with analysis of microdiffraction is used to determine the microstructure of subsurface layers of pure titanium sample before and after modification. We found that two layers of modified titanium are formed beneath the surface. A top surface polycrystalline layer of nanoscale grains is formed from a shock-molten layer via rapid crystallization. In a deeper subsurface layer, where the shock-induced melting becomes impossible due attenuation of SW, recrystallization of plastically deformed titanium leads to grain size changes in comparison with intact titanium. Molecular dynamics simulation of single-crystal titanium reveals that the SW front continues to melt/liquefy even after its temperature drops below the melting curve $T_m(P)$. The enormous shear stress generated in a narrow SW front leads to collapse/amorphization of the crystal lattice and formation of a supercooled metastable melt. Such melt crystallizes in an unloading tail of SW until its temperature becomes higher than $T_m(P)$ due to a rapid pressure drop. Later, crystallization of the subsurface molten layer will continue after the heat leaves it. After the shear stress drops below $\sim 12$GPa within the SW front, such the cold mechanical melting ceases giving place to the shock-induced plastic deformations. The depth of modification is limited by SW attenuation to the Hugoniot elastic limit, and can reach several micrometers. The obtained results reveal the basic physical mechanisms of surface hardening of metals by ultrashort laser pulses.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence for scientific discovery has recently generated
significant interest within the machine learning and scientific communities,
particularly in the domains of chemistry, biology, and material discovery. For
these scientific problems, molecules serve as the fundamental building blocks,
and machine learning has emerged as a highly effective and powerful tool for
modeling their geometric structures. Nevertheless, due to the rapidly evolving
process of the field and the knowledge gap between science (e.g., physics,
chemistry, & biology) and machine learning communities, a benchmarking study on
geometrical representation for such data has not been conducted. To address
such an issue, in this paper, we first provide a unified view of the current
symmetry-informed geometric methods, classifying them into three main
categories: invariance, equivariance with spherical frame basis, and
equivariance with vector frame basis. Then we propose a platform, coined
Geom3D, which enables benchmarking the effectiveness of geometric strategies.
Geom3D contains 16 advanced symmetry-informed geometric representation models
and 14 geometric pretraining methods over 46 diverse datasets, including small
molecules, proteins, and crystalline materials. We hope that Geom3D can, on the
one hand, eliminate barriers for machine learning researchers interested in
exploring scientific problems; and, on the other hand, provide valuable
guidance for researchers in computational chemistry, structural biology, and
materials science, aiding in the informed selection of representation
techniques for specific applications.</p>

GHP-MOFassemble generates novel linkers, assembled with one of three

MOFs in a primitive cubic topology. GHP-MOFassemble screens and validates
AI-generated MOFs for uniqueness, synthesizability, structural validity, uses
molecular dynamics simulations to study their stability and chemical

simulations to quantify their CO2 adsorption capacities. We present the top six
AI-generated MOFs with CO2 capacities greater than 2 $m mol/g$, i.e., higher

    <p>We theoretically investigated the topological-protected edge states (TESs) in an anisotropic honeycomb lattice with mirror and chiral symmetries, characterized by an alternative topological invariant - fractional polarization (FP), rather than the conventional Chern number. This system termed an FP insulator is a potential platform for edge-state engineering due to its disconnected TESs. These disconnected and robust TESs are susceptible to perturbative chiral symmetry-breaking terms which can generate various patterns including the vanishing helical, spin-polarized, and chiral TESs. Moreover, helical and chiral TES can be achieved by the finite size effect, not possible from the aforementioned terms alone. The demonstration of these various TES in an FP-insulator offers an alternative route in designing reconfigurable two-dimensional nanoelectronic devices.</p>

    <p>The study of the electronic properties of charged defects is crucial for our understanding of various electrical properties of materials. However, the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) hinders the research on large defect models. In this study, we present an E(3) equivariant graph neural network framework (HamGNN-Q), which can predict the tight-binding Hamiltonian matrices for various defect types with different charges using only one set of network parameters. By incorporating features of background charge into the element representation, HamGNN-Q enables a direct mapping from structure and background charge to the electronic Hamiltonian matrix of charged defect systems without DFT calculation. We demonstrate the model's high precision and transferability through testing on GaAs systems with various charged defect configurations. Our approach provides a practical solution for accelerating charged defect electronic structure calculations and advancing the design of materials with tailored electronic properties.</p>

    <p>Diamond is generally considered to have high thermal conductivity, so little attention has been paid to the laser heating effects at low excitation power. However, defects during the growth process can result in a great degradation of thermal conductivity, especially at low temperatures. Here, we observed the dynamic redshift and broadening of zero phonon line (ZPL) of silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamondin the experiment. Utilizing the intrinsic temperature response of the fine structure spectra of SiV as a probe, we confirmed that the laser heating effect appears and the temperature rising results from high defect concentration. By simulating the thermal diffusion process, we have estimated the thermal conductivity of around 1 W/(mK) at the local site, which is a two order magnitude lower than that of single-crystal diamond. Our results provide a feasible scheme for characterizing the laser heating effect of diamond at low temperatures.</p>

    <p>The discovery of efficient magnetization switching activated by the spin Hall effect (SHE)-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) changed the course of magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) research and development. However, for systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), the use of SOT is still hampered by the necessity of a longitudinal magnetic field to break the magnetic symmetry to achieve deterministic switching. In this work, we first demonstrate that a robust and tunable field-free current-driven SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization can be controlled by the growth protocol in Pt-based magnetic heterostructures. It is further elucidated that such growth-dependent symmetry breaking is originated from the laterally tilted magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnetic layer with PMA, which has been largely neglected in previous studies and its critical role should be re-focused. We show by both experiments and simulations that in a PMA system with tilted anisotropy, the deterministic field-free switching possesses a conventional SHE-induced damping-like torque feature and the resulting current-induced effective field has a non-linear dependence on the applied current density, which could be potentially misattributed to an unconventional SOT origin.</p>

    <p>Machine Learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate
prediction of different crystalline properties. Exiting state-of-the-art models
rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e. crystal graph structure, where
they construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D
space and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode
local chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture
important global periodic structural information like space group number,
crystal symmetry, rotational information, etc, which influence different
crystal properties. In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials
to model global structural information into graph structure and learn a more
robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we
first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing
descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple
multi-modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation
together to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline
materials. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across
ten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe that
fusing the textual representation with crystal graph structure provides
consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own
vanilla versions. We have shared the textual dataset, that we have curated for
both the benchmark material databases, with the community for future use.</p>

include the wallpaper and space groups. We derive linear and nonlinear
representations of functions that are (1) smooth and (2) invariant under such a

crystallographically invariant basis functions. We show that such a basis
exists for each crystallographic group, that it is orthonormal in the relevant
$L_2$ space, and recover the standard Fourier basis as a special case for pure
shift groups. The nonlinear representation embeds the orbit space of the group
into a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that such an embedding
exists for every crystallographic group, and that it factors functions through
a generalization of a manifold called an orbifold. We describe algorithms that,
given a standardized description of the group, compute the Fourier basis and an
embedding map. As examples, we construct crystallographically invariant neural
networks, kernel machines, and Gaussian processes.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We performed spin-, time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (STARPES) of excitons prepared by photoexcitation of inversion-symmetric 2H-WSe$_2$ with circularly polarized light. The very short probing depth of XUV photoemission permits selective measurement of photoelectrons originating from the top-most WSe$_2$ layer, allowing for direct measurement of hidden spin polarization of bright and momentum-forbidden dark excitons. Our results reveal efficient chiroptical control of bright excitons' hidden spin polarization. Following optical photoexcitation, intervalley scattering between nonequivalent K-K' valleys leads to a decay of bright excitons' hidden spin polarization. Conversely, the ultrafast formation of momentum-forbidden dark excitons acts as a local spin polarization reservoir, which could be used for spin injection in van der Waals heterostructures involving multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has established that for cubic network phases in diblock copolymer melts, the double-gyroid (DG) is thermodynamically stable relative to the competitor double-diamond (DD) and double-primitive (DP) phases, and exhibits a window of stability intermediate to the classical lamellar and columnar phases. This competition is widely thought to be controlled by "packing frustration" -- the incompatibility of uniformly filling melts with a locally preferred chain packing motif. Here, we reassess the thermodynamics of cubic network formation in strongly-segregated diblock melts, based on a recently developed medial strong segregation theory ("mSST") approach that directly connects the shape and thermodynamics of chain packing environments to the medial geometry of tubular network surfaces. We first show that medial packing significantly relaxes prior SST upper bounds on the free energy of network phases, which we attribute to the spreading of terminal chain ends within network nodal regions. Exploring geometric and thermodynamic metrics of chain packing in network phases, we show that mSST reproduces effects dependent on the elastic asymmetry of the blocks that are consistent with SCFT at large $œáN$. We then characterize geometric frustration in terms of the spatially-variant distributions of local entropic and enthalpic costs throughout the morphologies, extracted from mSST predictions. We find that the DG morphology, due to its unique medial geometry in the nodal regions, is stabilized by the incorporation of favorable, quasi-lamellar packing over much of its morphology, motifs which are inaccessible to DD and DP morphologies due to "interior corners" in their medial geometries. Finally, we use our results to analyze "hot spots" of chain stretching and discuss implications for network susceptibility to the uptake of guest molecules.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have synthesized high-quality single crystal samples of the erbium-based triangular lattice compound Ba3Er(BO3)3. Thermal and magnetic measurements reveal large anisotropy and a possible phase transition at 100 mK. The low-temperature magnetic heat capacity can be understood from the two Wyckoff positions that the magnetic ions Er3+ occupy, which have distinct symmetry properties and crystal field environments. A point charge calculation for the crystal electric field levels is consistent with this understanding. Based on symmetry analysis and classical simulation, we argue that Ba3Er(BO3)3 realizes an interesting two-sublattice exchange physics, in which the honeycomb lattice spins develop ferromagnetic correlations due to the additional spins at the hexagon centers but eventually order antiferromagnetically. Additionally, our results suggest that quantum fluctuations need to be considered in order to fully explain the experimental observations.</p>

    <p>Solutions of macromolecules can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form droplets with ultra-low surface tension. Droplets with such low surface tension wet and spread over common surfaces such as test tubes and microscope slides, complicating \textit{in vitro} experiments. Development of an universal super-repellent surface for macromolecular droplets has remained elusive because their ultra-low surface tension requires low surface energies. Furthermore, nonwetting of droplets containing proteins poses additional challenges because the surface must remain inert to a wide range of chemistries presented by the various amino-acid side-chains at the droplet surface. Here, we present a method to coat microscope slides with a thin transparent hydrogel that exhibits complete dewetting (contact angles $Œ∏\approx180^\circ)$ and minimal pinning of phase-separated droplets in aqueous solution. The hydrogel is based on a swollen matrix of chemically crosslinked polyethylene glycol diacrylate of molecular weight 12 kDa (PEGDA), and can be prepared with basic chemistry lab equipment. The PEGDA hydrogel is a powerful tool for \textit{in vitro} studies of weak interactions, dynamics, and internal organization of phase-separated droplets in aqueous solutions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Metastable materials are abundant in nature and technology, showcasing
remarkable properties that inspire innovative materials design. However,
traditional crystal structure prediction methods, which rely solely on
energetic factors to determine a structure's fitness, are not suitable for
predicting the vast number of potentially synthesizable phases that represent a
local minimum corresponding to a state in thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we
present a new approach for the prediction of metastable phases with specific
structural features, and interface this method with the XtalOpt evolutionary
algorithm. Our method relies on structural features that include the local
crystalline order (e.g., the coordination number or chemical environment), and
symmetry (e.g., Bravais lattice and space group) to filter the parent pool of
an evolutionary crystal structure search. The effectiveness of this approach is
benchmarked on three known metastable systems: XeN$_8$, with a two-dimensional
polymeric nitrogen sublattice, brookite TiO$_2$, and a high pressure BaH$_4$
phase that was recently characterized. Additionally, a newly predicted
metastable melaminate salt, $P$-1 WC$_{3}$N$_{6}$, was found to possess an
energy that is lower than two phases proposed in a recent computational study.
The method presented here could help in identifying the structures of compounds
that have already been synthesized, and developing new synthesis targets with
desired properties.</p>

A good quantitative agreement with experimental spin excitation spectra is found. Depending on the size of the Hund's coupling $J_H$ the systems chooses either Mott insulator or covalent insulator state when magnetic ordering is not allowed.

    <p>In this article, we report the results of relatively facile fabrication of carbon nanodots from single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT and MWCNT). The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman measurements show that the obtained carbon nanodots are quasi-two-dimensional objects with a diamond-like structure. Based on the characterization results, a theoretical model of synthesized carbon nanodots was developed. The measured absorption spectra demonstrate the similarity of the local atomic structure of carbon nanodots synthesized from single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. However, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of nanodots synthesized from both sources turned out to be completely different. Carbon dots fabricated from MWCNTs exhibit PL spectra similar to nanoscale carbon systems with sp3 hybridization and a valuable edge contribution. At the same time nanodots synthesized from SWCNTs exhibit PL spectra which are typical for quantum dots with an estimated size of ~0.6-1.3 nm.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Point clouds are versatile representations of 3D objects and have found widespread application in science and engineering. Many successful deep-learning models have been proposed that use them as input. The domain of chemical and materials modeling is especially challenging because exact compliance with physical constraints is highly desirable for a model to be usable in practice. These constraints include smoothness and invariance with respect to translations, rotations, and permutations of identical atoms. If these requirements are not rigorously fulfilled, atomistic simulations might lead to absurd outcomes even if the model has excellent accuracy. Consequently, dedicated architectures, which achieve invariance by restricting their design space, have been developed. General-purpose point-cloud models are more varied but often disregard rotational symmetry. We propose a general symmetrization method that adds rotational equivariance to any given model while preserving all the other requirements. Our approach simplifies the development of better atomic-scale machine-learning schemes by relaxing the constraints on the design space and making it possible to incorporate ideas that proved effective in other domains. We demonstrate this idea by introducing the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, which is not intrinsically equivariant but achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets of molecules and solids. A-posteriori application of our general protocol makes PET exactly equivariant, with minimal changes to its accuracy.</p>

    <p>Use of electrode materials that show phase change behavior and hence drastic changes in electrochemical activity during operation, have not been explored for Li-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the vanadium oxide (VO2) cathode that undergoes metal-insulator transition due to first-order structural phase transition at accessible temperature of 68¬∞C for battery operation. Using a suitable electrolyte operable across the phase transition range and compatible with vanadium oxide cathodes, we studied the effect of electrode structure change on lithium insertion followed by the electrochemical characteristics above and below the phase transition temperature. The high-temperature VO2 phase shows significantly improved capacitance, enhanced current rate capabilities, improved electrical conductivity and lithium-ion diffusivity compared to the insulating low temperature phase. This opens up new avenues for electrode designs, allowing manipulation of electrochemical reactions around phase transition temperatures, and in particular enhancing electrochemical properties at elevated temperatures contrary to existing classes of battery chemistries that lead to performance deterioration at elevated temperatures.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A solid-state quantum emitter is one of the indispensable components for
optical quantum technologies. Ideally, an emitter should have a compatible
wavelength for efficient coupling to other components in a quantum network. It
is therefore essential to understand fluorescent defects that lead to specific
emitters. In this work, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to
demonstrate the calculation of the complete optical fingerprints of quantum
emitters in the two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride. These
emitters are of great interest, yet many of them are still to be identified.
Our results suggest that instead of comparing a single optical property, such
as the commonly used zero-phonon line energy, multiple properties should be
used when comparing theoretical simulations to the experiment. This way, the
entire electronic structure can be predicted and quantum emitters can be
designed and tailored. Moreover, we apply this approach to predict the
suitability for using the emitters in specific quantum applications,
demonstrating through the examples of the Al$_{\text{N}}$ and
P$_{\text{N}}$V$_{\text{B}}$ defects. We therefore combine and apply DFT
calculations to identify quantum emitters in solid-state crystals with a lower
risk of misassignments as well as a way to design and tailor optical quantum
systems. This consequently serves as a recipe for classification and the
generation of universal solid-state quantum emitter systems in future hybrid
quantum networks.</p>

    <p>In the past decades many density-functional theory methods and codes adopting
periodic boundary conditions have been developed and are now extensively used
in condensed matter physics and materials science research. Only in 2016,
however, their precision (i.e., to which extent properties computed with
different codes agree among each other) was systematically assessed on
elemental crystals: a first crucial step to evaluate the reliability of such
computations. We discuss here general recommendations for verification studies
aiming at further testing precision and transferability of
density-functional-theory computational approaches and codes. We illustrate
such recommendations using a greatly expanded protocol covering the whole
periodic table from Z=1 to 96 and characterizing 10 prototypical cubic
compounds for each element: 4 unaries and 6 oxides, spanning a wide range of
coordination numbers and oxidation states. The primary outcome is a reference
dataset of 960 equations of state cross-checked between two all-electron codes,
then used to verify and improve nine pseudopotential-based approaches. Such
effort is facilitated by deploying AiiDA common workflows that perform
automatic input parameter selection, provide identical input/output interfaces
across codes, and ensure full reproducibility. Finally, we discuss the extent
to which the current results for total energies can be reused for different
goals (e.g., obtaining formation energies).</p>

    <p>The spatially nonlocal response functions of graphene obtained on the basis of first principles of quantum field theory using the polarization tensor are considered in the areas of both the on-the-mass-shell and off-the-mass-shell waves. It s shown that at zero frequency the longitudinal permittivity of graphene is the regular function, whereas the transverse one possesses a double pole for any nonzero wave vector. According to our results, both the longitudinal and transverse permittivities satisfy the dispersion (Kramers-Kronig) relations connecting their real and imaginary parts, as well as expressing each of these permittivities along the imaginary frequency axis via its imaginary part. For the transverse permittivity, the form of an additional term arising in the dispersion relations due to the presence of a double pole is found. The form of dispersion relations is unaffected by the branch points which arise on the real frequency axis in the presence of spatial nonlocality. The obtained results are discussed in connection with the well known problem of the Lifshitz theory which was found to be in conflict with the measurement data when using the much studied response function of metals. A possible way of attack on this problem based on the case of graphene is suggested.</p>

    <p>In material research, structural characterization often requires multiple complementary techniques to obtain a holistic morphological view of the synthesized material. Depending on the availability of and accessibility of the different characterization techniques (e.g., scattering, microscopy, spectroscopy), each research facility or academic research lab may have access to high-throughput capability in one technique but face limitations (sample preparation, resolution, access time) with other techniques(s). Furthermore, one type of structural characterization data may be easier to interpret than another (e.g., microscopy images are easier to interpret than small angle scattering profiles). Thus, it is useful to have machine learning models that can be trained on paired structural characterization data from multiple techniques so that the model can generate one set of characterization data from the other. In this paper we demonstrate one such machine learning workflow, PairVAE, that works with data from Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) that presents information about bulk morphology and images from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) that presents two-dimensional local structural information of the sample. Using paired SAXS and SEM data of novel block copolymer assembled morphologies [open access data from Doerk G.S., et al. Science Advances. 2023 Jan 13;9(2): eadd3687], we train our PairVAE. After successful training, we demonstrate that the PairVAE can generate SEM images of the block copolymer morphology when it takes as input that sample's corresponding SAXS 2D pattern, and vice versa. This method can be extended to other soft materials morphologies as well and serves as a valuable tool for easy interpretation of 2D SAXS patterns as well as creating a database for other downstream calculations of structure-property relationships.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Particulate air pollution is taking a huge toll on modern society, being associated with more than three million deaths per year. In addition, airborne infectious microorganism can spread dangerous diseases, further elevating the problem. A common way to mitigate the risks of airborne particles is by air filtration. However, conventional air filters usually do not provide any functionality beyond particle removal. They are unable to inactivate accumulated contaminants and therefore need periodic maintenance and replacement to remain operational and safe. This work presents a multifunctional, self-cleaning air filtration system which utilizes a novel graphene-enhanced air filter medium (GeFM). The hybrid network of the GeFM combines the passive structure-based air filtration properties of an underlying ceramic network with additional active features based on the functional properties of a graphene thin film. The GeFM is able to capture >95 % of microorganisms and particles larger than 1 $Œº$m and can be repetitively Joule-heated to >300 ¬∞C for several hours without signs of degradation. Hereby, built-up organic particulate matter and microbial contaminants are effectively decomposed, regenerating the GeFM. Additionally, the GeFM provides unique options to monitor the filter's air troughput and loading status during operation. The active features of the GeFM can drastically improve filter life-time and safety, offering great potential for the development of safer and more sustainable air filtration solutions to face the future challenges of air pollution and pandemics.</p>

    <p>Proton tunneling is believed to be non-local in ice but has never been shown experimentally. Here we measured thermal conductivity of ice under pressure up to 50 GPa and found it to increase with pressure until 20 GPa but decrease at higher pressures. We attribute this anomalous drop of thermal conductivity to the collective tunneling of protons at high pressures, supported by large-scale quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The collective tunneling loops span several picoseconds in time and are as large as nanometers in space, which match the phonon periods and wavelengths, leading to strong phonon scattering at high pressures. Our results show direct evidence of collective quantum motion existing in high-pressure ice and provide a new perspective to understanding the coupling between phonon propagation and atomic tunneling.</p>

    <p>We investigate the correlated state of Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ using neutron scattering, finding signatures of correlations of both dipolar and octupolar character. A dipolar inelastic signal is also observed, as expected for spinons in a quantum spin ice (QSI). Fits of thermodynamic data using exact diagonalization methods indicate that the largest interaction is an octupolar exchange, with a strength roughly twice as large as other terms. A hierarchy of exchange interactions with dominant octupolar and significant dipolar exchange, still in the octupolar QSI phase, rationalises neutron scattering observations. Our results reveal a `quantum multipolar liquid' where correlations involve multiple terms in moment series expansion, opening questions about their intertwining and possible hierarchy.</p>

    <p>We investigate the adiabatic approximation to the exact-exchange kernel for calculating correlation energies within the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation framework of time-dependent density functional theory. A numerical study is performed on a set of systems having bonds of different character (H$_2$ and N$_2$ molecules, H-chain, H$_2$-dimer, solid-Ar and the H$_2$O-dimer). We find that the adiabatic kernel can be sufficient in strongly bound covalent systems, yielding similar bond lengths and binding energies. However, for non-covalent systems the adiabatic kernel introduces significant errors around equilibrium geometry, systematically overestimating the interaction energy. The origin of this behaviour is investigated by studying a model dimer composed of one-dimensional closed-shell atoms interacting via soft-Coulomb potentials. The kernel is shown to exhibit a strong frequency dependence at small to intermediate atomic separation that affects both the low-energy spectrum and the exchange-correlation hole obtained from the corresponding diagonal of the two-particle density matrix.</p>

    <p>Altermagnet (AM) is a novel time reversal symmetry broken magnetic phase with $d$-wave order which has been experimentally realized recently.

    <p>The pressure-induced color change in the nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride has triggered extensive discussions about the underlying physics. Here, we study the optical response of LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$ in a broad frequency range at ambient pressure and its evolution with pressure in the visible spectral range. The broad-band optical spectra at ambient pressure reveal a Drude component associated with intra-band electronic transitions and two Lorentz components (L1 and L2) arising from inter-band electronic transitions. The application of pressure causes a spectral weight transfer from L1 to the Drude component, leading to a blue shift of the plasma edge in the reflectivity spectrum alongside a reduction of the high-frequency reflectivity. Our results suggest that the pressure-induced color change in LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$ is closely related to the transformation between intra- and inter-band electronic transitions, providing new insights into the mechanism of the pressure-induced color change in LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Language models are powerful tools for molecular design. Currently, the dominant paradigm is to parse molecular graphs into linear string representations that can easily be trained on. This approach has been very successful, however, it is limited to chemical structures that can be completely represented by a graph -- like organic molecules -- while materials and biomolecular structures like protein binding sites require a more complete representation that includes the relative positioning of their atoms in space. In this work, we show how language models, without any architecture modifications, trained using next-token prediction -- can generate novel and valid structures in three dimensions from various substantially different distributions of chemical structures. In particular, we demonstrate that language models trained directly on sequences derived directly from chemical file formats like XYZ files, Crystallographic Information files (CIFs), or Protein Data Bank files (PDBs) can directly generate molecules, crystals, and protein binding sites in three dimensions. Furthermore, despite being trained on chemical file sequences -- language models still achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that use graph and graph-derived string representations, as well as other domain-specific 3D generative models. In doing so, we demonstrate that it is not necessary to use simplified molecular representations to train chemical language models -- that they are powerful generative models capable of directly exploring chemical space in three dimensions for very different structures.</p>

    <p>Ubiquitous in most superconducting materials and a common result of nanofabrication processes, weak-links are known for their limiting effects on the transport of electric currents. Still, they are at the root of key features of superconducting technology. By performing quantitative magneto-optical imaging experiments and thermomagnetic model simulations, we correlate the existence of local maxima in the magnetization loops of FIB-patterned Nb films to a magnetic field-induced weak-to-strong-link transformation increasing their critical current. This phenomenon arises from the nanoscale interaction between quantized magnetic flux lines and FIB-induced modifications of the device microstructure. Under an ac drive field, this leads to a rectified vortex motion along the weak-link. The reported tunable effect can be exploited in the development of new superconducting electronic devices, such as flux pumps and valves, to attenuate or amplify the supercurrent through a circuit element, and as a strategy to enhance the critical current in weak-link-bearing devices.</p>

We investigated the resonant effects in five $(n,m)$ chiralities and find that the er-CARS intensity varies drastically between different nanotube species. The experimental results are compared with a perturbation theory model. Finally, we show that such giant resonant non-linear signals enable rapid mapping and local heating of individualized CNTs, suggesting easy tracking of CNTs for future nanotoxology studies and therapeutic application in biological tissues.</p>

    <p>We have performed an experimental and modeling-based study of the spin-orbit torque-induced growth of magnetic stripe domains in heavy metal/ferromagnet thin-film heterostructures that possess chiral N√©el-type domain walls due to an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In agreement with previous reports, the stripe domains stabilized in these systems exhibit a significant transverse growth velocity relative to the applied current axis. This behavior has previously been attributed to the Magnus force-like skyrmion Hall effect of the stripe domain spin topology, which is analogous to that of a half-skyrmion. However, through analytic modeling of the in-plane torques generated by spin-orbit torque, we find that a dynamical reconfiguration of the domain wall magnetization profile is expected to occur - promoting motion with similar directionality and symmetry as the skyrmion Hall effect. These results further highlight the sensitivity of spin-orbit torque to the local orientation of the domain wall magnetization profile and its contribution to domain growth directionality.</p>

    <p>Stable or metastable crystal structures of assembled atoms can be predicted
by finding the global or local minima of the energy surface within a broad
space of atomic configurations. Generally, this requires repeated
first-principles energy calculations, which is often impractical for large
crystalline systems. Here, we present significant progress toward solving the
crystal structure prediction problem: we performed noniterative, single-shot
screening using a large library of virtually created crystal structures with a
machine-learning energy predictor. This shotgun method (ShotgunCSP) has two key
technical components: transfer learning for accurate energy prediction of
pre-relaxed crystalline states, and two generative models based on element
substitution and symmetry-restricted structure generation to produce promising
and diverse crystal structures. First-principles calculations were performed
only to generate the training samples and to refine a few selected pre-relaxed
crystal structures. The ShotunCSP method is computationally less intensive than
conventional methods and exhibits exceptional prediction accuracy, reaching
93.3% in benchmark tests with 90 different crystal structures.</p>

    <p>Spin-active quantum emitters have emerged as a leading platform for quantum technologies. However, one of their major limitations is the large spread in optical emission frequencies, which typically extends over tens of GHz. Here, we investigate single V4+ vanadium centres in 4H-SiC, which feature telecom-wavelength emission and a coherent S=1/2 spin state. We perform spectroscopy on single emitters and report the observation of spin-dependent optical transitions, a key requirement for spin-photon interfaces. By engineering the isotopic composition of the SiC matrix, we reduce the inhomogeneous spectral distribution of different emitters down to 100 MHz, significantly smaller than any other single quantum emitter. Additionally, we tailor the dopant concentration to stabilise the telecom-wavelength V4+ charge state, thereby extending its lifetime by at least two orders of magnitude. These results bolster the prospects for single V emitters in SiC as material nodes in scalable telecom quantum networks.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Scattering problems are important in describing light propagation in wide ranging media such as the atmosphere, colloidal solutions, metamaterials, glass ceramic composites, transparent polycrystalline ceramics, and surfaces. The Rayleigh Gans Debye (RGD) approximation has enjoyed great success in describing a wide range of scattering phenomena. We derive a generalized RGD formulation from the perturbation of Maxwell equations. In contrast to most treatments of RGD scattering, our formulation can model any soft scattering phenomena in linear media, including scattering by stochastic process, lossy media, and by anisotropic inhomogeneities occurring at multiple length scales. Our first-principles derivation makes explicit underlying assumptions and provides jumping off points for more general treatments. The derivation also facilitates a deeper understanding of soft scattering. It is demonstrated that sources of scattering are not interfaces as is often presumed, but excess accelerating charges emitting uncompensated radiation. Approximations to the equations are also presented and discussed. For example, the scattering coefficient in the large size RGD limit is shown to be proportional to the correlation length and the variance of a projected phase shift.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Data-driven approaches for material discovery and design have been
accelerated by emerging efforts in machine learning. However, general
representations of crystals to explore the vast material search space remain
limited. We introduce a material discovery framework that uses natural language
embeddings derived from language models as representations of compositional and
structural features. The discovery framework consists of a joint scheme that
first recalls relevant candidates, and next ranks the candidates based on
multiple target properties. The contextual knowledge encoded in language
representations conveys information about material properties and structures,
enabling both representational similarity analysis for recall, and multi-task
learning to share information across related properties. By applying the
framework to thermoelectrics, we demonstrate diversified recommendations of
prototype structures and identify under-studied high-performance material
spaces. The recommended materials are corroborated by first-principles
calculations and experiments, revealing novel materials with potential high
performance. Our framework provides a task-agnostic means for effective
material recommendation and can be applied to various material systems.</p>

    <p>The secondary phase, such as Ni$_3$Al-based $L1_2$ $\gamma^\prime$, is
crucially important for precipitation strengthening of superalloys.
Composition-structure-property relations provide useful insights for guided

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We propose a novel, physically-constrained and differentiable approach for the generation of D-dimensional qudit states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in quantum optics. We circumvent any limitations imposed by the inherently stochastic nature of the physical process and incorporate a set of stochastic dynamical equations governing its evolution under the SPDC Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through the design of structured nonlinear photonic crystals (NLPCs) and shaped pump beams; and show, theoretically and experimentally, how to generate maximally entangled states in the spatial degree of freedom. The learning of NLPC structures offers a promising new avenue for shaping and controlling arbitrary quantum states and enables all-optical coherent control of the generated states. We believe that this approach can readily be extended from bulky crystals to thin Metasurfaces and potentially applied to other quantum systems sharing a similar Hamiltonian structures, such as superfluids and superconductors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Efficient generation and manipulation of spin signals in a given material
without invoking external magnetism remain one of the challenges in
spintronics. The spin Hall effect (SHE) and Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) are
well-known mechanisms to electrically generate spin accumulation in materials
with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), but the exact role of the strength and
type of SOC, especially in crystals with low symmetry, has yet to be explained.
In this study, we investigate REE in two different families of non-magnetic
chiral materials, elemental semiconductors (Te and Se) and semimetallic
disilicides (TaSi$_2$ and NbSi$_2$), using an approach based on density
functional theory (DFT). By analyzing spin textures across the full Brillouin
zones and comparing them with REE magnitudes calculated as a function of
chemical potential, we link specific features in the electronic structure with
the efficiency of the induced spin accumulation. Our findings show that
magnitudes of REE can be increased by: (i) the presence of purely radial
(Weyl-type) spin texture manifesting as the parallel spin-momentum locking,
(ii) high spin polarization of bands along one specific crystallographic
direction, (iii) low band velocities. By comparing materials possessing the
same crystal structures, but different strengths of SOC, we conclude that
larger SOC may indirectly contribute to the enhancement of REE. It yields
greater spin-splitting of bands along specific crystallographic directions,
which prevents canceling the contributions from the oppositely spin-polarized
bands over wider energy regions and helps maintain larger REE magnitudes. We
believe that these results will be useful for designing spintronics devices and
may aid further computational studies searching for efficient REE in materials
with different symmetries and SOC strengths.</p>

    <p>Bifurcations in kinetic pathways decide the evolution of a system. An example is crystallization, in which the thermodynamically stable polymorph may not form due to kinetic hindrance. Here, we use confined self-assembly to investigate the interplay of thermodynamics and kinetics in the crystallization pathways of finite clusters. We report the observation of decahedral clusters from colloidal particles in emulsion droplets and show that these decahedral clusters can be thermodynamically stable just like icosahedral clusters. Our hard sphere simulations reveal how the development of the early nucleus shape passes through a bifurcation that decides the cluster symmetry. A geometric argument explains why decahedral clusters are kinetically hindered and why icosahedral clusters can be dominant even if they are not the thermodynamic ground state.</p>

    <p>Efficiently predicting properties of porous crystalline materials has great
potential to accelerate the high throughput screening process for developing
new materials, as simulations carried out using first principles model are
often computationally expensive. To effectively make use of Deep Learning
methods to model these materials, we need to utilize the symmetries present in
the crystals, which are defined by their space group. Existing methods for
crystal property prediction either have symmetry constraints that are too
restrictive or only incorporate symmetries between unit cells. In addition,
these models do not explicitly model the porous structure of the crystal. In
this paper, we develop a model which incorporates the symmetries of the unit
cell of a crystal in its architecture and explicitly models the porous
structure. We evaluate our model by predicting the heat of adsorption of CO$_2$
for different configurations of the mordenite zeolite. Our results confirm that
our method performs better than existing methods for crystal property
prediction and that the inclusion of pores results in a more efficient model.</p>

    <p>Stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a facile strategy
for realising exotic quantum states of matter and engineering electronic
properties. Yet, developments beyond the proof-of-principle level are impeded
by the vast size of the configuration space defined by layer combinations and
stacking orders. Here we employ a density functional theory (DFT) workflow to
calculate interlayer binding energies of 8451 homobilayers created by stacking
1052 different monolayers in various configurations. Analysis of the stacking
orders in 247 experimentally known van der Waals crystals is used to validate
the workflow and determine the criteria for realizable bilayers. For the 2586
most stable bilayer systems, we calculate a range of electronic, magnetic, and
vibrational properties, and explore general trends and anomalies. We identify
an abundance of bistable bilayers with stacking order-dependent magnetic or
electrical polarisation states making them candidates for slidetronics

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The development of many optical quantum technologies depends on the availability of solid-state single quantum emitters with near-perfect optical coherence. However, a standing issue that limits systematic improvement is the significant sample heterogeneity and lack of mechanistic understanding of microscopic energy flow at the single emitter level and ultrafast timescales. Here we develop solution-phase single-particle pump-probe spectroscopy with photon correlation detection that captures sample-averaged dynamics in single molecules and/or defect states with unprecedented clarity at femtosecond resolution. We apply this technique to single quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride, which suffers from significant heterogeneity and low quantum efficiency. From millisecond to nanosecond timescales, the translation diffusion, metastable-state-related bunching shoulders, rotational dynamics, and antibunching features are disentangled by their distinct photon-correlation timescales, which collectively quantify the normalized two-photon emission quantum yield. Leveraging its femtosecond resolution, spectral selectivity and ultralow noise (two orders of magnitude improvement over solid-state methods), we visualize electron-phonon coupling in the time domain at the single defect level, and discover the acceleration of polaronic formation driven by multi-electron excitation. Corroborated with results from a theoretical polaron model, we show how this translates to sample-averaged photon fidelity characterization of cascaded emission efficiency and optical decoherence time. Our work provides a framework for ultrafast spectroscopy in single emitters, molecules, or defects prone to photoluminescence intermittency and heterogeneity, opening new avenues of extreme-scale characterization and synthetic improvements for quantum information applications.</p>

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we provide evidence of the CO induced Dirac fermion-related bands near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the band folding at the Fermi level is compatible with the new periodicity dictated by the CO, indicating that the electrons near the Fermi level follow the crystalline symmetries needed to host double Dirac fermions in this system.</p>

four out of five analyzed properties if one considers all available reference

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning techniques have successfully been used to extract structural
information such as the crystal space group from powder X-ray diffractograms.
However, training directly on simulated diffractograms from databases such as
the ICSD is challenging due to its limited size, class-inhomogeneity, and bias
toward certain structure types. We propose an alternative approach of
generating synthetic crystals with random coordinates by using the symmetry
operations of each space group. Based on this approach, we demonstrate online
training of deep ResNet-like models on up to a few million unique on-the-fly
generated synthetic diffractograms per hour. For our chosen task of space group
classification, we achieved a test accuracy of 79.9% on unseen ICSD structure
types from most space groups. This surpasses the 56.1% accuracy of the current
state-of-the-art approach of training on ICSD crystals directly. Our results
demonstrate that synthetically generated crystals can be used to extract
structural information from ICSD powder diffractograms, which makes it possible
to apply very large state-of-the-art machine learning models in the area of
powder X-ray diffraction. We further show first steps toward applying our
methodology to experimental data, where automated XRD data analysis is crucial,
especially in high-throughput settings. While we focused on the prediction of
the space group, our approach has the potential to be extended to related tasks
in the future.</p>

structures and ABAQUS to evaluate the stress welds using the finite element
method. The initial dataset contains 200 samples with 20 held from training for
validation. The network gives speedups of around 200x to 6000x using a CPU or
GPU, with signifcant memory savings, compared to finite element analysis with a
modest reduction in accuracy of up to 10%. Network performance is not
correlated with grain structure regularity or texture, showing generalisation
of the network beyond the training set to arbitrary Zr crystal structures.
Performance when trained with 200 and 400 samples was measured, finding an
improvement in accuracy of approximately 10% when the size of the dataset was
doubled.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The density of states (DOS) is a spectral property of materials, which
provides fundamental insights on various characteristics of materials. In this
paper, we propose a model to predict the DOS by reflecting the nature of DOS:
DOS determines the general distribution of states as a function of energy.
Specifically, we integrate the heterogeneous information obtained from the
crystal structure and the energies via multi-modal transformer, thereby
modeling the complex relationships between the atoms in the crystal structure,
and various energy levels. Extensive experiments on two types of DOS, i.e.,
Phonon DOS and Electron DOS, with various real-world scenarios demonstrate the
superiority of DOSTransformer. The source code for DOSTransformer is available

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) are a powerful and broadly used
tool to characterize the electronic structure of materials, from chemical
bonding to dielectric response to topological properties. Most generally, one
can construct MLWFs that describe isolated band manifolds, e.g. for the valence
bands of insulators, or entangled band manifolds, e.g. in metals or describing
both the valence and the conduction manifolds in insulators. Obtaining MLWFs
that describe a target manifold accurately and with the most compact
representation often requires chemical intuition and trial and error, a
challenging step even for experienced researchers and a roadblock for automated
high-throughput calculations. Here, we present a powerful approach that
automatically provides MLWFs spanning the occupied bands and their natural
complement for the empty states, resulting in Wannier Hamiltonian models that
provide a tight-binding picture of optimized atomic orbitals in crystals. Key
to the success of the algorithm is the introduction of a projectability measure
for each Bloch state onto atomic orbitals (here, chosen from the
pseudopotential projectors) that determines if that state should be kept
identically, discarded, or mixed into a disentangling algorithm. We showcase
the accuracy of our method by comparing a reference test set of 200 materials
against the selected-columns-of-the-density-matrix algorithm, and its
reliability by constructing Wannier Hamiltonians for 21737 materials from the
Materials Cloud.</p>

    <p>We present ab initio calculations of hidden magnetoelectric multipolar order
in Cr$_2$O$_3$ and its iron-based analogue, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. First, we
discuss the connection between the order of such hidden multipoles and the
linear magnetoelectric effect. Next, we show the presence of hidden
antiferroically-ordered magnetoelectric multipoles in both the prototypical
magnetoelectric material Cr$_2$O$_3$, and centrosymmetric $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$,
which has the same crystal structure as Cr$_2$O$_3$, but a different magnetic
dipolar ordering. In turn, we predict anti-magnetoelectric effects, in which
local magnetic dipole moments are induced in opposite directions under the
application of an external electric field, to create an additional
antiferromagnetic ordering. We confirm the predicted induced moments using
first-principles calculations. Our results demonstrate the existence of hidden
magnetoelectric multipoles leading to local linear magnetoelectric responses
even in centrosymmetric materials, where a net bulk linear magnetoelectric
effect is forbidden by symmetry.</p>

    <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been applied to a large variety of
applications in materials science and chemistry. Here, we recapitulate the
graph construction for crystalline (periodic) materials and investigate its
impact on the GNNs model performance. We suggest the asymmetric unit cell as a
representation to reduce the number of atoms by using all symmetries of the
system. This substantially reduced the computational cost and thus time needed
to train large graph neural networks without any loss in accuracy. Furthermore,
with a simple but systematically built GNN architecture based on message
passing and line graph templates, we introduce a general architecture (Nested
Graph Network, NGN) that is applicable to a wide range of tasks. We show that
our suggested models systematically improve state-of-the-art results across all
tasks within the MatBench benchmark. Further analysis shows that optimized
connectivity and deeper message functions are responsible for the improvement.
Asymmetric unit cells and connectivity optimization can be generally applied to
(crystal) graph networks, while our suggested nested graph framework will open
new ways of systematic comparison of GNN architectures.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A first-principles method is presented to calculate elastic constants up to
the fourth order of crystals with the cubic and hexagonal symmetries. The
method relies on the numerical differentiation of the second Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor and a density functional theory approach to compute the Cauchy
stress tensors for a minimal list of strained configurations of a reference
state. The number of strained configurations required to calculate the
independent elastic constants of the second, third, and fourth order is 24 and
37 for crystals with the cubic and hexagonal symmetries, respectively. Here,
this method is applied to five crystalline materials with the cubic symmetry
(diamond, silicon, aluminum, silver, and gold) and two metals with the
hexagonal close packing structure (beryllium and magnesium). Our results are
compared to available experimental data and previous computational studies.
Calculated linear and nonlinear elastic constants are also used, within a
nonlinear elasticity treatment of a material, to predict values of volume and
bulk modulus at zero temperature over an interval of pressures. To further
validate our method, these predictions are compared to results obtained from
explicit density functional theory calculations.</p>

    <p>Normalizing flows (NF) are a class of powerful generative models that have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex distributions with high flexibility and expressiveness. In this work, we introduce a new type of normalizing flow that is tailored for modeling positions and orientations of multiple objects in three-dimensional space, such as molecules in a crystal. Our approach is based on two key ideas: first, we define smooth and expressive flows on the group of unit quaternions, which allows us to capture the continuous rotational motion of rigid bodies; second, we use the double cover property of unit quaternions to define a proper density on the rotation group. This ensures that our model can be trained using standard likelihood-based methods or variational inference with respect to a thermodynamic target density. We evaluate the method by training Boltzmann generators for two molecular examples, namely the multi-modal density of a tetrahedral system in an external field and the ice XI phase in the TIP4P water model. Our flows can be combined with flows operating on the internal degrees of freedom of molecules and constitute an important step towards the modeling of distributions of many interacting molecules.</p>

    <p>A rigorous account of quantum nonlocal effects is paramount for understanding the optical response of metal nanostructures and for designing plasmonic devices at the nanoscale. Here, we present a scheme for retrieving the quantum surface response of metals, encapsulated in the Feibelman $d$-parameters, from electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. We theoretically demonstrate that quantum nonlocal effects have a dramatic impact on EELS and CL spectra, in the guise of spectral shifts and nonlocal damping, when either the system size or the inverse wave vector in extended structures approach the nanometer scale. Our concept capitalizes on the unparalleled ability of free-electrons to supply deeply subwavelength near-fields and, thus, probe the optical response of metals at length scales in which quantum-mechanical effects are apparent. These results pave the way for a widespread use of the $d$-parameter formalism, thereby facilitating a rigorous yet practical inclusion of nonclassical effects in nanoplasmonics.</p>

    <p>Graphene is an ideal platform to study the coherence of quantum interference pathways by tuning doping or laser excitation energy. The latter produces a Raman excitation profile that provides direct insight into the lifetimes of intermediate electronic excitations and, therefore, on quantum interference, which has so far remained elusive. Here, we control the Raman scattering pathways by tuning the laser excitation energy in graphene doped up to 1.05eV, above what achievable with electrostatic doping. The Raman excitation profile of the G mode indicates its position and full width at half maximum are linearly dependent on doping. Doping-enhanced electron-electron interactions dominate the lifetime of Raman scattering pathways, and reduce Raman interference. This paves the way for engineering quantum pathways in doped graphene, nanotubes and topological insulators.</p>

    <p>Metal surface cleaning or etching techniques using reactive plasma are emerging as one of the dry processing techniques for surface contaminants with high bond energy, especially for cleaning and decontamination of nuclear components and equipment. In this study, the plasma reaction due to the discharge of a dielectric barrier of a mixture of 95% helium and 5% fluorine with cobalt oxide film grown on the surface of stainless steel 304 was studied experimentally. Experimental results show that cobalt oxide becomes a powder after plasma irradiation and is easily separated from the surface of the base metal. The optimal plasma generating conditions of the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) used in this experimental study were obtained at atmospheric pressure, voltage 4.5 kV, and frequency 25 kHz with a etching rate of 10.875 Œºmol/min. The samples were analyzed before and after plasma irradiation, using Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and the purification rate was performed using a sequential weighting of the samples with scales 10^(-4) grams accurately obtained. The results show the ability of this method to effectively remove the surface contamination of cobalt from the surface of stainless steel 304.</p>

including alloys, disordered and heterogeneous systems, the challenge of

energy landscape around a vacancy in Stillinger-Weber silicon crystal and
silicon-germanium zincblende structure using the activation-relaxation
technique nouveau (ARTn). We find that a a targeted on-the-fly approach
specific and integrated to ARTn generates the highest precision on the

This approach expands the type of problems that can be addressed with

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The interplay between dimensionality and various phases of matter is a central inquiry in condensed matter physics. New phases are often discovered through spontaneously broken symmetry. Understanding the dimensionality of superconductivity in the high-temperature cuprate analogue $-$ layered nickelates and revealing a new symmetry-breaking state are the keys to deciphering the underlying pairing mechanism. Here, we demonstrate the highly-tunable dimensionality and a broken rotational symmetry state in the superconductivity of square-planar layered nickelates. The superconducting state, probed by superconducting critical current and magnetoresistance within superconducting transition under direction-dependent in-plane magnetic fields, exhibits a $C_2$ rotational symmetry which breaks the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of the square-planar lattice. Furthermore, by performing detailed examination of the angular dependent upper critical fields at temperatures down to 0.5 K with high-magnetic pulsed-fields, we observe a crossover from two-dimensional to three-dimensional superconducting states which can be manipulated by the ionic size fluctuations in the rare-earth spacer layer. Such a large degree of controllability is desired for tailoring strongly two/three-dimensional superconductors and navigating various pairing landscapes for a better understanding of the correlation between reduced dimensionality and unconventional pairing. These results illuminate new directions to unravel the high-temperature superconducting pairing mechanism.</p>

    <p>The variational quantum eigensolver is a promising way to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computer, while its success relies on a well-designed wavefunction ansatz. Compared to physically motivated ansatzes, hardware heuristic ansatzes usually lead to a shallower circuit, but it may still be too deep for an NISQ device. Inspired by the quantum neural network, we propose a new hardware heuristic ansatz where the circuit depth can be significantly reduced by introducing ancilla qubits, which makes a practical simulation of a chemical reaction with more than 20 atoms feasible on a currently available quantum computer. More importantly, the expressibility of this new ansatz can be improved by increasing either the depth or the width of the circuit, which makes it adaptable to different hardware environments. These results open a new avenue to develop practical applications of quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

    <p>The kagome metal CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ features an unusual competition between the charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) inside the CDW phase has been accumulating. Hence, the superconductivity in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ emerges from a TRSB normal state, potentially resulting in an exotic superconducting state. To reveal the pairing symmetry, we first investigate the effect of nonmagnetic impurity. Our results show that the superconducting critical temperature is insensitive to disorder, pointing to conventional $s$-wave superconductivity. Moreover, our measurements of the self-field critical current ($I_{c,sf}$), which is related to the London penetration depth, also confirm conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with strong coupling. Finally, we measure $I_{c,sf}$ where the CDW order is removed by pressure and superconductivity emerges from the pristine normal state. Our results show that $s$-wave gap symmetry is retained, providing strong evidence for the presence of conventional $s$-wave superconductivity in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ irrespective of the presence of the TRSB</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have wide applications in superconductors,
quantum, and topological materials. However, their rational design is not well
established, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D
materials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density
functional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed
to discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a
generative material design pipeline, namely material transformer
generator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We
train two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural
language models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The
models are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions,
which are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction.
Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability
based on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new
DFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including
NiCl$_4$, IrSBr, CuBr$_3$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential
of our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D
materials and other functional materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The diffusion of small molecular penetrants through polymeric materials represents an important fundamental problem, relevant to the design of materials for applications such as coatings and membranes. Polymer networks hold promise in these applications, because dramatic differences in molecular diffusion can result from subtle changes in the network structure. In this paper, we use molecular simulation to understand the role that crosslinked network polymers have in governing the molecular motion of penetrants. By considering the local, activated alpha relaxation time of the penetrant and its long-time diffusive dynamics, we can determine the relative importance of activated glassy dynamics on penetrants at the segmental scale versus entropic mesh confinement on penetrant diffusion. We vary several parameters, such as the crosslinking density, temperature, and penetrant size, to show that crosslinks primarily affect molecular diffusion through modification of the matrix glass transition, with local penetrant hopping at least partially coupled to the segmental relaxation of the polymer network. This coupling is very sensitive to the local activated segmental dynamics of the surrounding matrix, and we also show that penetrant transport is affected by dynamic heterogeneity at low temperatures. To contrast, only at high temperatures and for large penetrants or when the dynamic heterogeneity effect is weak does the effect of mesh confinement become significant, even though penetrant diffusion more broadly empirically follows similar trends as established models of mesh confinement-based transport.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The phase-field crystal (PFC) model describes crystal lattices at diffusive
timescales. Its amplitude expansion (APFC) can be applied to the investigation
of relatively large systems under some approximations. However, crystal
symmetries accessible within the APFC model are limited to basic ones, namely
triangular and square in two dimensions, and body-centered cubic and
face-centered cubic in three dimensions. In this work, we propose a general,
amplitudes-based description of virtually any lattice symmetry. To fully
exploit the advantages of this model, featuring slowly varying quantities in
bulk and localized significant variations at dislocations and interfaces, we
consider formulations suitable for real-space numerical methods supporting
adaptive spatial discretization. We explore approaches originally proposed for
the PFC model which allow for symmetries beyond basic ones through extended
parametrizations. Moreover, we tackle the modeling of non-Bravais lattices by
introducing an amplitude expansion for lattices with a basis and further
generalizations. We study and discuss the stability of selected, prototypical
lattice symmetries. As pivotal examples, we show that the proposed approach
allows for a coarse-grained description of the kagome lattice, exotic square
arrangements, and the diamond lattice, as bulk crystals and, importantly,
hosting dislocations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The Berry curvature (BC) - a quantity encoding the geometric properties of the electronic wavefunctions in a solid - is at the heart of different Hall-like transport phenomena, including the anomalous Hall and the non-linear Hall and Nernst effects. In non-magnetic quantum materials with acentric crystalline arrangements, local concentrations of BC are generally linked to single-particle wavefunctions that are a quantum superposition of electron and hole excitations. BC-mediated effects are consequently observed in two-dimensional systems with pairs of massive Dirac cones and three-dimensional bulk crystals with quartets of Weyl cones. Here, we demonstrate that in materials equipped with orbital degrees of freedom local BC concentrations can arise even in the complete absence of hole excitations. In these solids, the crystals fields appearing in very low-symmetric structures trigger BCs characterized by hot-spots and singular pinch points. These characteristics naturally yield giant BC dipoles and large non-linear transport responses in time-reversal symmetric conditions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Wilson fermion (WF) is a fundamental particle in the theory of quantum chromodynamics, originally proposed by Kenneth Wilson to solve the fermion doubling problem, i.e., more fermions than expected when one puts fermionic fields on a lattice. In this Letter, we report a direct observation of the WF in circuit systems. It is found that WFs manifest as topological spin textures analogous to the half skyrmion, half-skyrmion pair, and N√©el skyrmion structures, depending on their mass. Transformations of different WF states are realized by merely tuning the electric elements. Theoretical calculations have shown that the WF with a half-skyrmion profile represents a novel quantum anomalous semimetal phase supporting a chiral edge current [B. Fu et al. npj Quantum Mater. 7, 94 (2022)], but the experimental evidence is still lacking. We experimentally observe the propagation of chiral edge current along the domain-wall separating two circuits with contrast fractional Chern numbers. Our work presents the first experimental evidence for WFs in topolectrical circuits. The nontrivial analogy between the WF state and the skyrmionic structure builds an intimate connection between the two burgeoning fields.</p>

    <p>The organic system, $Œ∫$-[(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$(BEDT-STF)$_x$]$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, showing the Mott transition between a nonmagnetic Mott insulating (NMI) state and a Fermi liquid (FL), is systematically studied by calorimetric measurements. An increase of the electronic heat capacity at the transition from the NMI state to the FL state which keeps the triangular dimer lattice demonstrates that the charge sector lost in the Mott insulating state is recovered in the FL state. We observed that the remaining low-energy spin excitations in the Mott insulating state show unique temperature dependence, and that the NMI state has a larger lattice entropy originating from the frustrated lattice, which leads to the Pomeranchuk-like effect on the electron localization. Near the Mott boundary, an unexpected enhancement and magnetic-field dependence of heat capacity are observed. This anomalous heat capacity is different from the behavior in the typical first-order Mott transition and shows similarities with quantum critical behavior. To reconcile our results with previously reported scenarios about a spin gap and the first-order Mott transition, further studies are desired.</p>

    <p>This study investigates radiation damage in three metals in the low
temperature and high radiant flux regime using molecular dynamics and a Frenkel
pair accumulation method to simulate up to $2.0$ displacements per atom. The
metals considered include Fe, equiatomic CrCoNi, and a fictitious metal with
identical bulk properties to the CrCoNi composed of a single atom type referred
to as an A-atom. CrCoNi is found to sustain higher concentrations of
dislocations than either the Fe or A-atom systems and more stacking faults than
the A-atom system. The results suggest that the concentration of vacancies and
interstitials are substantially higher for the CrCoNi than the A-atom system,
perhaps reflecting that the recombination radius is smaller in CrCoNi due to
the roughened potential energy landscape. A model that partitions the major
contributions from defects to the stored energy is described, and serves to
highlight a general need for higher fidelity approaches to point defect
identification.</p>

    <p>It is well known that phonons can overscreen the bare Coulomb electron-electron repulsion, turning it into the effective attraction that binds the Cooper pairs responsible for BCS superconductivity. Here, we use a simple lattice model to prove that the counterpart of this is also possible, whereby phonons overscreen the bare electron-hole attraction and may turn it repulsive at short distances, driving exciton dissociation in certain regions of the parameter space. We argue that this phonon-mediated short-range screening plays an important role in the physics of organic solar cell materials (and other materials with strong electron-phonon coupling) and could point the way to new strategies for optimizing their efficiencies.</p>

    <p>The areal footprint of memristors is a key consideration in material-based neuromorophic computing and large-scale architecture integration. Electronic transport in the most widely investigated memristive devices is mediated by filaments, posing a challenge to their scalability in architecture implementation. Here we present a compelling alternative memristive device and demonstrate that areal downscaling leads to enhancement in memristive memory window, while maintaining analogue behavior, contrary to expectations. Our device designs directly integrated on semiconducting Nb-SrTiO$_3$ allows leveraging electric field effects at edges, increasing the dynamic range in smaller devices. Our findings are substantiated by studying the microscopic nature of switching using scanning transmission electron microscopy, in different resistive states, revealing an interfacial layer whose physical extent is influenced by applied electric fields. The ability of Nb-SrTiO$_3$ memristors to satisfy hardware and software requirements with downscaling, while significantly enhancing memristive functionalities, makes them strong contenders for non-von Neumann computing, beyond CMOS.</p>

    <p>Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs-based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure, resulting in a record-high Tc among all synthesized SnAs-based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out-of-plane pz orbital to the in-plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p-orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconductors.</p>

    <p>The discovery of a chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals, the non-conservation of chiral charge and energy across two opposite chirality Weyl nodes, has sparked immense interest in understanding its impact on various physical phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the existence of electrical, thermal, and gravitational quantum chiral anomalies in 3D spin-orbit coupled systems. Notably, these anomalies involve chiral charge transfer across two Fermi surfaces linked to a single Weyl-like point, rather than across opposite chirality Weyl nodes as in Weyl semimetals. Our findings reveal that the Berry curvature flux piercing the Fermi surface plays a critical role in distinguishing the `chirality' of the carriers and the corresponding chiral charge and energy transfer. Importantly, we demonstrate that these quantum chiral anomalies lead to interesting thermal spin transport such as the spin Nernst effect. Our results suggest that 3D spin-orbit coupled metals offer a promising platform for investigating the interplay between quantum chiral anomalies and charge and spin transport in non-relativistic systems.</p>

    <p>Two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) are a highly desired quantum phase but few materials have demonstrated clear signatures of a 2D TI state. It has been predicted that 2D TIs can be created from thin films of three-dimensional TIs by reducing the film thickness until the surface states hybridize. Here, we employ this technique to report the first observation of a 2D TI state in epitaxial thin films of cadmium arsenide, a prototype Dirac semimetal in bulk form and a 3D TI in thin films. Using magnetotransport measurements with electrostatic gating, we observe a Landau level spectrum and quantum Hall effect that are in excellent agreement with those of an ideal 2D TI. Specifically, we observe a crossing of the zeroth Landau levels at a critical magnetic field. We show that the film thickness can be used to tune the critical magnetic field. Moreover, a larger change in film thickness causes a transition from a 2D TI to a 2D trivial insulator, just as predicted by theory. The high degree of tunability available in epitaxial cadmium arsenide heterostructures can thus be used to fine-tune the 2D TI, which is essential for future topological devices.</p>

    <p>Interfaces of dye molecules and two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) combine strong molecular dipole excitations with high carrier mobilities in semiconductors. F√∂rster type energy transfer is one key mechanism for the coupling between both constituents.

Our approach is based on microscopic Bloch equations which are solved self-consistently together with Maxwells equations. This approach allows to incorporate the dielectric environment of a TMDC semiconductor, sandwiched between donor molecules and a substrate. Our analysis reveals transfer rates in the meV range for typical dye molecules in closely stacked structures, with a non-trivial dependence of the F√∂rster rate on the molecular transition energy resulting from unique signatures of dark, momentum forbidden TMDC excitons.</p>

The algorithm, which we name AVQMETTS, dynamically generates compact and problem-specific quantum circuits, which are suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We benchmark AVQMETTS on statevector simulators and perform thermal energy calculations of integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions and demonstrate an approximately linear system-size scaling of the circuit complexity. We further map out the finite-temperature phase transition line of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Finally, we study the impact of noise on AVQMETTS calculations using a phenomenological noise model.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Nanometric metallic stripes allow the transmission of optical signals via the excitation and propagation of surface-localized evanescent electromagnetic waves, with important applications in the field of nano-photonics. Whereas this kind of plasmonic phenomena typically exploits noble metals, like Ag or Au, other materials can exhibit viable light-transport efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate the transport of visible light in nanometric niobium stripes coupled with a dielectric polymeric layer, exploiting the remotely-excited/detected Raman signal of black phosphorus (bP) as the probe. The light-transport mechanism is ascribed to the generation of surface plasmon polaritons at the Nb/polymer interface. The propagation length is limited due to the lossy nature of niobium in the optical range, but this material may allow the exploitation of specific functionalities that are absent in noble-metal counterparts.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The magnetic subsystem of nabokoite, KCu$_7$(TeO$_4$)(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, is constituted by copper ions forming a buckled square kagom√© lattice decorated by quasi-isolated ions. This combination determines peculiar physical properties of this compound evidenced in electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$, magnetization $M$ and specific heat $C_p$ measurements. At lowering temperature, the magnetic susceptibility $œá= M/H$ passes through a broad hump inherent for low-dimensional magnetic systems at about 150 K and a sharp peak at antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N = 3.2 $K. The $C_p(T,H)$ curves demonstrate additional peak-like anomaly at $T_{peak}= 5.7$K robust to magnetic field. The latter can be ascribed to low-lying singlet excitations filling the singlet-triplet gap in magnetic excitation spectrum of the square kagom√© lattice [J.Richter, O.Derzhko and J.Schnack, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{105} (2022) 144427]. ESR spectroscopy provides indications that antiferromagnetic structure below $T_N$ is non-collinear. Separate issue is the observation of antiferroelectric-type behavior in $\varepsilon$ at low temperatures, which tentatively reduces the symmetry and partially lifts frustration of magnetic interactions of decorating copper ions with buckled square kagom√© lattice. These complex thermodynamic and resonant properties signal the presence of two weakly coupled magnetic subsystems in nabokoite, namely a spin-liquid in square kagom√© lattice layers and an antiferromagnet represented by decorating ions.</p>

    <p>Topological Interlocking Structures (TIS) have been increasingly studied in the past two decades. However, some fundamental questions concerning the effects of Young's modulus and the friction coefficient on the structural mechanics of the most common type of TIS application - centrally loaded slabs - are not yet clear. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind parametric study based on the Level-Set-Discrete-element-Method that aims to clarify how these two parameters affect multiple aspects of the behavior and failure of centrally-loaded TIS slabs. This includes the evolution of the structural response up to and including failure, the foremost structural response parameters, and the residual carrying capacity. We find that the structural response parameters in TIS slabs scale linearly with Young's modulus, that they saturate with the friction coefficient, and that the saturated response provides an upper-bound on the capacity of centrally loaded TIS slabs reported in the literature. This, together with additional findings, insights, and observations, comprise a novel contribution to our understanding of the interlocked structural form.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In a magnetic texture, the spin of a conduction electron is forced to be aligned to the localized moment. As a result, the topology of the magnetic texture affects the electron dynamics in nontrivial ways. A representative example is the topological Hall effect in noncoplanar spin textures with finite spin chirality. While propagating in the noncoplanar spin texture, electrons acquire Berry phase, and their motion is deflected as if they were in a magnetic field. Here, we report a distinct Berry phase effect in a coplanar helimagnet: the spin moment of the conduction electron is polarized under electric currents depending on the chirality of the helimagnet. The accumulated spin polarization works as a source of spin current, and the chirality can be detected by the inverse spin Hall mechanism. The functionality allows us to read out the chirality without magnetic fields, and therefore paves the way to future helimagnet-based spintronics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topological physics has revolutionised materials science, introducing topological insulators and superconductors with applications from smart materials to quantum computing. Bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) is a core concept therein, where the non-trivial topology of a material's bulk predicts localized topological states at its boundaries. However, edge states also exist in systems where BBC is seemingly violated, leaving any topological origin unknown. For finite-frequency mechanical metamaterials, BBC has hitherto been described in terms of displacements, necessitating fixed boundaries to identify topologically protected edge modes. Herein, we introduce a new family of finite-frequency mechanical metamaterials whose topological properties emerge in strain coordinates for free boundaries. We show two examples, the first being the canonical mass-dimer, where BBC in strain coordinates reveals the previously unknown topological origin of its edge modes. Second, we introduce a new mechanical analog of the Majorana-supporting Kitaev chain. We theoretically and experimentally show that this Kitaev chain supports edge states for both free and fixed boundaries, wherein BBC is established in strains and displacements, respectively. Our findings suggest a previously undiscovered class of topological edge modes may exist, including within other settings such as electrical circuits and optics, and for more complex, tailored boundaries with coordinates other than strain.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Elemental mapping images can be achieved through step scanning imaging using pinhole optics or micro pore optics (MPO), or alternatively by full-field X-ray fluorescence imaging (FF-XRF). X-ray optics for FF-XRF can be manufactured with different micro-channel geometries such as square, hexagonal or circular channels. Each optic geometry creates different imaging artefacts. Square-channel MPOs generate a high intensity central spot due to two reflections via orthogonal channel walls inside a single channel, which is the desirable part for image formation, and two perpendicular lines forming a cross due to reflections in one plane only.
  Thus, we have studied the performance of a square-channel MPO in an FF-XRF imaging system. The setup consists of a commercially available MPO provided by Photonis and a Timepix3 readout chip with a silicon detector. Imaging of fluorescence from small metal particles has been used to obtain the point spread function (PSF) characteristics. The transmission through MPO channels and variation of the critical reflection angle are characterized by measurements of fluorescence from Copper and Titanium metal fragments. Since the critical angle of reflection is energy dependent, the cross-arm artefacts will affect the resolution differently for different fluorescence energies. It is possible to identify metal fragments due to the form of the PSF function. The PSF function can be further characterized using a Fourier transform to suppress diffuse background signals in the image.</p>

    <p>MXenes are a class of 2D/layered materials which are highly conductive, hydrophilic, have a large electrochemical surface area and are easily processible into electrodes for energy applications. Since the discovery of MXenes over ten years ago, these materials have been mainly used in the preparation of electrodes for batteries and supercapacitors. However, due to their aforementioned properties, MXenes could potentially be utilised as a component in the catalyst layer for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). This opinion piece will discuss some of the recent literature in the area of hybrid catalysts consisting of various Transition Metal Oxides (TMOs) and MXenes for the OER. We will also discuss current drawbacks and future outlook in this new area of research.</p>

    <p>We investigate the effect of spatial doping of the Mott insulator LaVO$_3$ by inserting a few layers of the correlated metal SrVO$_3$ in multilayer geometries. Using density functional theory in combination with dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that this leads to a geometrically confined and robust metallic layer that stabilizes the metallicity in SrVO$_3$ even in the ultrathin layer limit, suppressing a potential dimensionality-induced metal-insulator transition. For a thicker SrVO$_3$ layer, we find a continuous transition of both structural and electronic properties across the interface between the two materials, with bulk properties reestablished on a length scale of 2-3 unit cells away from the interface. We show that a strain modulation applied along the growth direction can lead to asymmetric charge reconstruction at chemically symmetric interfaces. However, we find that this effect is rather weak, implying that fractional occupancy, and thus metallicity, persists at the interfaces.</p>

Our measurements reveal an excitation that closely resembles the antiferromagnetic resonance mode typical of easy-axis antiferromagnets, nevertheless, it displays an unusual, four-times larger Zeeman splitting in an applied magnetic field. We identify this excitation with an $|S_z|=4$ multipolar magnon -- a single-ion 4-magnon bound state -- that corresponds to a full reversal of a single magnetic moment of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion. We argue that condensation of multipolar magnons in large-spin materials with a strong magnetic anisotropy can produce new exotic states.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We report spin-polarized transient absorption for colloidal CdSe nanoplatelets as functions of thickness (2 to 6 monolayer thickness) and core/shell motif. Using electro-optical modulation of co- and cross-polarization pump-probe combinations, we sensitively observe spin-polarized transitions. Core-only nanoplatelets exhibit few-picosecond spin lifetimes that weakly increase with layer thickness. Spectral content of differenced spin-polarized signals indicate biexciton binding energies that decrease with increasing thickness and smaller values than previously reported. Shell growth of CdS with controlled thicknesses, which partially delocalize the electron from the hole, significantly increases the spin lifetime to ~49 picoseconds at room temperature. Implementation of ZnS shells, which do not alter delocalization but do alter surface termination, increased spin lifetimes up to ~100 ps, bolstering the interpretation that surface termination heavily influences spin coherence, likely due to passivation of dangling bonds. Spin precession in magnetic fields both confirms long coherence lifetime at room temperature and yields excitonic g-factor.</p>

    <p>Heat-capacity measurements are a useful tool for understanding the complex phase behaviour of systems containing one-dimensional motifs. Here we study the signature within such measurements of the incorporation of defects into quasi-one-dimensional (q-1D) systems. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that, on dilution by non-interacting sites, q-1D Ising models display a low-temperature signature not present in conventional three-dimensional models. Frustrated embeddings of 1D chains show similar features to unfrustrated embeddings, with the additional emergence of a finite ground-state entropy in the former, which arises from chain segmentation. We introduce a mean-field formulation which captures the low-temperature behaviour of the model. This theoretical framework is applied to the interpretation of experimental heat-capacity measurements of the Tb$_{1-œÅ}$Y$_œÅ$(HCOO)$_3$ family of magnetocalorics. We find good correspondence between simulation and experiment, establishing this system as a canonical example of dilute q-1D magnets.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Research on conjugated polymers for thermoelectric applications has made tremendous progress in recent years, which is accompanied by surging interest in molecular doping as a means to achieve the high electrical conductivities that are required. A detailed understanding of the complex relationship between the doping process, the structural as well as energetic properties of the polymer films, and the resulting thermoelectric behavior is slowly emerging. This review summarizes recent developments and strategies that permit enhancing the electrical conductivity of p- and n-type conjugated polymers via molecular doping. The impact of the chemical design of both the polymer and the dopant, the processing conditions, and the resulting nanostructure on the doping efficiency and stability of the doped state are discussed. Attention is paid to the interdependence of the electrical and thermal transport characteristics of semiconductor host-dopant systems and the Seebeck coefficient. Strategies that permit to improve the thermoelectric performance, such as an uniaxial alignment of the polymer backbone in both bulk and thin film geometries, manipulation of the dielectric constant of the polymer, and the variation of the dopant size, are explored. A combination of theory and experiment is predicted to yield new chemical design principles and processing schemes that will ultimately give rise to the next generation of organic thermoelectric materials.</p>

    <p>We propose an effective method for removing thermal vibrations that
complicate the task of analyzing complex dynamics in atomistic simulation of
condensed matter. Our method iteratively subtracts thermal noises or
perturbations in atomic positions using a denoising score function trained on
synthetically noised but otherwise perfect crystal lattices. The resulting
denoised structures clearly reveal underlying crystal order while retaining
disorder associated with crystal defects. Purely geometric, agnostic to
interatomic potentials, and trained without inputs from explicit simulations,
our denoiser can be applied to simulation data generated from vastly different
interatomic interactions. The denoiser is shown to improve existing
classification methods such as common neighbor analysis and polyhedral template
matching, reaching perfect classification accuracy on a recent benchmark
dataset of thermally perturbed structures up to the melting point. Demonstrated
here in a wide variety of atomistic simulation contexts, the denoiser is
general, robust, and readily extendable to delineate order from disorder in
structurally and chemically complex materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Oxidation states are the charges of atoms after their ionic approximation of
their bonds, which have been widely used in charge-neutrality verification,
crystal structure determination, and reaction estimation. Currently only
heuristic rules exist for guessing the oxidation states of a given compound
with many exceptions. Recent work has developed machine learning models based
on heuristic structural features for predicting the oxidation states of metal
ions. However, composition based oxidation state prediction still remains
elusive so far, which is more important in new material discovery for which the
structures are not even available. This work proposes a novel deep learning
based BERT transformer language model BERTOS for predicting the oxidation
states of all elements of inorganic compounds given only their chemical
composition. Our model achieves 96.82\% accuracy for all-element oxidation
states prediction benchmarked on the cleaned ICSD dataset and achieves 97.61\%
accuracy for oxide materials. We also demonstrate how it can be used to conduct
large-scale screening of hypothetical material compositions for materials
discovery.</p>

    <p>A crystal symmetry search is crucial for computational crystallography and
materials science. Although algorithms and implementations for the crystal
symmetry search have been developed, their extension to magnetic space groups
(MSGs) remains limited. In this paper, algorithms for determining magnetic
symmetry operations of magnetic crystal structures, identifying magnetic
space-group types of given MSGs, searching for transformations to a BNS
setting, and symmetrizing the magnetic crystal structures using the MSGs are
presented. The determination of magnetic symmetry operations is numerically
stable and is implemented with minimal modifications from the existing crystal
symmetry search. Magnetic space-group types and transformations to the BNS
setting are identified by a two-step approach combining space-group type
identification and the use of affine normalizers. Point coordinates and
magnetic moments of the magnetic crystal structures are symmetrized by
projection operators for the MSGs. An implementation is distributed with a

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Studies of structure-property relationships in spintronics are essential for
the design of materials that can fill specific roles in devices. For example,
materials with low symmetry allow unconventional configurations of
charge-to-spin conversion which can be used to generate efficient spin-orbit
torques. Here, we explore the relationship between crystal symmetry and
geometry of the Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) that causes spin accumulation in
response to an applied electric current. Based on a symmetry analysis performed
for 230 crystallographic space groups, we identify classes of materials that
can host conventional or collinear REE. Although transverse spin accumulation
is commonly associated with the so-called 'Rashba materials', we show that the
presence of specific spin texture does not easily translate to the
configuration of REE. More specifically, bulk crystals may simultaneously host
different types of spin-orbit fields, depending on the crystallographic point
group and the symmetry of the specific $k$-vector, which, averaged over the
Brillouin zone, determine the direction and magnitude of the induced spin
accumulation. To explore the connection between crystal symmetry, spin texture,
and the magnitude of REE, we perform first-principles calculations for
representative materials with different symmetries. We believe that our results
will be helpful for further computational and experimental studies, as well as
the design of spintronics devices.</p>

    <p>Recent work has shown the potential of graph neural networks to efficiently
predict material properties, enabling high-throughput screening of materials.
Training these models, however, often requires large quantities of labelled
data, obtained via costly methods such as ab initio calculations or
experimental evaluation. By leveraging a series of material-specific
transformations, we introduce CrystalCLR, a framework for constrastive learning
of representations with crystal graph neural networks. With the addition of a
novel loss function, our framework is able to learn representations competitive
with engineered fingerprinting methods. We also demonstrate that via model
finetuning, contrastive pretraining can improve the performance of graph neural
networks for prediction of material properties and significantly outperform
traditional ML models that use engineered fingerprints. Lastly, we observe that
CrystalCLR produces material representations that form clusters by compound

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In a magnetic metal, the Hall resistance is generally taken to be the sum of the ordinary Hall resistance and the anomalous Hall resistance. Here it is shown that this empirical relation is no longer valid when either the ordinary Hall angle or the anomalous Hall angle is not small. Using the proper conductivity relation, we reveal an unexpected magnetoresistance (MR) induced by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). A $B$-linear MR arises and the sign of the slope depends on the sign of the anomalous Hall angle, giving rise to a characteristic bowtie shape. The Hall resistance in a single-band system can exhibit a nonlinearity which is usually considered as a characteristic of a two-band system. A $B$-symmetric component appears in the Hall. These effects reflect the fundamental difference between the ordinary Hall effect and the AHE. Furthermore, we experimentally reproduce the unusual MR and Hall reported before in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ and show that these observations can be well explained by the proposed mechanism. MR often observed in quantum anomalous Hall insulators provides further confirmation of the picture. The effect may also account for the large MR observed in non-magnetic three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Natural optical activity is the paradigmatic example of an effect originating
in the weak spatial inhomogeneity of the electromagnetic field on the atomic
scale. In molecules, such effects are well described by the multipole theory of
electromagnetism, where the coupling to light is treated semiclassically beyond
the electric-dipole approximation. That theory has two shortcomings: it is
limited to bounded systems, and its building blocks - the multipole transition
moments - are origin dependent. In this work, we recast the multipole theory in
a translationally-invariant form that remains valid for crystals. Working in
the independent-particle approximation, we introduce "intrinsic" multipole
transition moments that are origin independent and transform covariantly under
gauge transformations of the Bloch eigenstates. Electric-dipole transitions are
given by the interband Berry connection, while magnetic-dipole and
electric-quadrupole transitions are described by matrix generalizations of the
intrinsic magnetic moment and quantum metric. In addition to multipole-like
terms, the response of crystals at first order in the wavevector of light
contains band-dispersion terms that have no counterpart in molecular theories.
The full response is broken down into magnetoelectric and quadrupolar parts,
which can be isolated in the static limit where electric and magnetic fields
become decoupled. The rotatory-strength sum rule for crystals is found to be
equivalent to the topological constraint for a vanishing chiral magnetic effect
in equilibrium, and the formalism is validated by numerical tight-binding
calculations.</p>

    <p>The subthreshold leakage current in transistors has become a critical limiting factor for realizing ultra-low-power transistors. The leakage current is predominantly dictated by the long thermal tail of the charge carriers. We propose a solution to this problem by using narrow bandwidth semiconductors for limiting the thermionic leakage current by filtering out the high energy carriers. We specifically demonstrate this solution in transistors with laterally confined monolayer MoSi2N4 with different passivation serving as channel material. Remarkably, we find that the proposed narrow bandwidth devices can achieve a large ON/OFF current ratio with an ultra-low-power supply voltage of 0.1 V, even for devices with a 5 nm gate length. We also show that several other materials share the unique electronic properties of narrow bandwidth conduction and valance bands in the same series.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) are promising candidates for ultra-thin active nanophotonic elements due to the strong tunable excitonic resonances that dominate their optical response. Here we demonstrate dynamic beam steering by an active van der Waals metasurface that leverages large complex refractive index tunability near excitonic resonances in monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2). Through varying the radiative and nonradiative rates of the excitons, we can dynamically control both the reflection amplitude and phase profiles, resulting in an excitonic phased array metasurface. Our experiments show reflected light steering to angles between -30¬∞ to 30¬∞ at three different resonant wavelengths corresponding to the A exciton, B exciton, and trion. This active van der Waals metasurface relies solely on the excitonic resonances of the monolayer MoSe2 material rather than geometric resonances of patterned nanostructures, suggesting the potential to harness the tunability of excitonic resonances for wavefront shaping in emerging photonic applications.</p>

    <p>We theoretically propose that the monolayer $A$Ti$X$ family (KTiSb, KTiBi, RbTiSb, SrTiSn) are potential candidates for large-gap quantum anomalous Hall insulators with high Chern number $\mathcal{C}=2$. Both of the topology and magnetism in these materials are from $3d$-orbitals of Ti. We construct the tight-binding model with symmetry analysis to reveal the origin of topology. Remarkably, quite different from the conventional $s$-$d$ band inversion, here the topological band inversion within $3d$ orbitals is due to the crystal field and electron hopping, while spin-orbit coupling only trivially gaps out the Dirac cone at Fermi level. The general physics from the $3d$ orbitals here applies to a large class of transition metal compounds with the space group $P4/nmm$ or $P$-$42m$ and their subgroups.</p>

    <p>From AlexNet to Inception, autoencoders to diffusion models, the development of novel and powerful deep learning models and learning algorithms has proceeded at breakneck speeds. In part, we believe that rapid iteration of model architecture and learning techniques by a large community of researchers over a common representation of the underlying entities has resulted in transferable deep learning knowledge. As a result, model scale, accuracy, fidelity, and compute performance have dramatically increased in computer vision and natural language processing. On the other hand, the lack of a common representation for chemical structure has hampered similar progress. To enable transferable deep learning, we identify the need for a robust 3-dimensional representation of materials such as molecules and crystals. The goal is to enable both materials property prediction and materials generation with 3D structures. While computationally costly, such representations can model a large set of chemical structures. We propose $\textit{ParticleGrid}$, a SIMD-optimized library for 3D structures, that is designed for deep learning applications and to seamlessly integrate with deep learning frameworks. Our highly optimized grid generation allows for generating grids on the fly on the CPU, reducing storage and GPU compute and memory requirements. We show the efficacy of 3D grids generated via $\textit{ParticleGrid}$ and accurately predict molecular energy properties using a 3D convolutional neural network. Our model is able to get 0.006 mean square error and nearly match the values calculated using computationally costly density functional theory at a fraction of the time.</p>

band-nesting regions close to Fermi level. Generally, the studied transitions
are optically active, exhibiting in-plane polarization of light. Finally, we
quantify their energy trends under external hydrostatic, uniaxial, and biaxial
stresses by determining the linear pressure coefficients. Generally, negative
pressure coefficients are obtained implying the narrowing of the band gap. The
semiconducting-to-metal transition are predicted under hydrostatic pressure. We
discuss these trends in terms of orbital composition of involved electronic
bands. In addition, we demonstrate that the measured pressure coefficients of
HfS2 and HfSe2 absorption edges are in perfect agreement with our predictions.

    <p>The theory of bulk orbital magnetization has been formulated both in
reciprocal space based on Berry curvature and related quantities, and in real
space in terms of the spatial average of a quantum mechanical local marker.
Here we consider a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic material having a
vanishing bulk but a nonzero surface orbital magnetization. We ask whether the
surface-normal component of the surface magnetization is well defined, and if
so, how to compute it. As the physical observable corresponding to this
quantity, we identify the macroscopic current running along a hinge shared by
two facets. However, the hinge current only constrains the difference of the
surface magnetizations on the adjoined facets, leaving a potential ambiguity.
By performing a symmetry analysis, we find that only crystals exhibiting a
pseudoscalar symmetry admit well-defined magnetizations at their surfaces at
the classical level. We then explore the possibility of computing surface
magnetization via a coarse-graining procedure applied to a quantum local
marker. We show that multiple expressions for the local marker exist, and apply
constraints to filter out potentially meaningful candidates. Using several
tight-binding models as our theoretical test bed and several potential markers,
we compute surface magnetizations for slab geometries and compare their
predictions with explicit calculations of the macroscopic hinge currents of rod
geometries. We find that only a particular form of the marker consistently
predicts the correct hinge currents.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Discovering relationships between materials' microstructures and mechanical
properties is a key goal of materials science. Here, we outline a strategy
exploiting Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the multidimensional
space of microstructures, defined here by the size distribution of precipitates
(fixed impurities or inclusions acting as obstacles for dislocation motion)
within a simple two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model. The aim is
to design a microstructure optimizing a given mechanical property, e.g.,
maximizing the expected value of shear stress for a given strain. The problem
of finding the optimal discretized shape for a distribution involves a norm
constraint, and we find that sampling the space of possible solutions should be
done in a specific way in order to avoid convergence problems. To this end, we
propose a general mathematical approach that can be used to generate trial
solutions uniformly at random while enforcing an Euclidean norm constraint.
Both equality and inequality constraints are considered. A simple technique can
then be used to convert between Euclidean and other Lebesgue $p$-norm (the
1-norm in particular) constrained representations. Considering different
dislocation-precipitate interaction potentials, we demonstrate the convergence
of the algorithm to the optimal solution and discuss its possible extensions to
the more complex and realistic case of three-dimensional dislocation systems
where also the optimization of precipitate shapes could be considered.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal-graph attention networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools
for the prediction of thermodynamic stability and materials properties from
unrelaxed crystal structures. Previous networks trained on two million
materials exhibited, however, strong biases originating from underrepresented
chemical elements and structural prototypes in the available data. We tackled
this issue computing additional data to provide better balance across both
chemical and crystal-symmetry space. Crystal-graph networks trained with this
new data show unprecedented generalization accuracy, and allow for reliable,
accelerated exploration of the whole space of inorganic compounds. We applied
this universal network to perform machine-learning assisted high-throughput
materials searches including 2500 binary and ternary structure prototypes and
spanning about 1 billion compounds. After validation using density-functional
theory, we uncover in total 19512 additional materials on the convex hull of
thermodynamic stability and ~150000 compounds with a distance of less than 50
meV/atom from the hull. Combining again machine learning and ab-initio methods,
we finally evaluate the discovered materials for applications as
superconductors, superhard materials, and we look for candidates with large gap
deformation potentials, finding several compounds with extreme values of these
properties.</p>

    <p>The long-wavelength behavior of vibrational modes plays a central role in
carrier transport, phonon-assisted optical properties, superconductivity, and
thermomechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials. Here, we present
general invariance and equilibrium conditions of the lattice potential; these
allow to recover the quadratic dispersions of flexural phonons in
low-dimensional materials, in agreement with the phenomenological model for
long-wavelength bending modes. We also prove that for any low-dimensional
material the bending modes can have a purely out-of-plane polarization in the
vacuum direction and a quadratic dispersion in the long-wavelength limit. In
addition, we propose an effective approach to treat invariance conditions in
crystals with non-vanishing Born effective charges where the long-range
dipole-dipole interactions induce a contribution to the lattice potential and
stress tensor. Our approach is successfully applied to the phonon dispersions
of 158 two-dimensional materials, highlighting its critical relevance in the
study of phonon-mediated properties of low-dimensional materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Noise and uncertainty are usually the enemy of machine learning, noise in
training data leads to uncertainty and inaccuracy in the predictions. However,
we develop a machine learning architecture that extracts crucial information
out of the noise itself to improve the predictions. The phenomenology computes
and then utilizes uncertainty in one target variable to predict a second target
variable. We apply this formalism to PbZr$_{0.7}$Sn$_{0.3}$O$_{3}$ crystal,
using the uncertainty in dielectric constant to extrapolate heat capacity,
correctly predicting a phase transition that otherwise cannot be extrapolated.
For the second example -- single-particle diffraction of droplets -- we utilize
the particle count together with its uncertainty to extrapolate the ground
truth diffraction amplitude, delivering better predictions than when we utilize
only the particle count. Our generic formalism enables the exploitation of
uncertainty in machine learning, which has a broad range of applications in the
physical sciences and beyond.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful computational method used to
obtain physical and chemical properties of materials. In the materials
discovery framework, it is often necessary to virtually screen a large and
high-dimensional chemical space to find materials with desired properties.
However, grid searching a large chemical space with DFT is inefficient due to
its high computational cost. We propose an approach utilizing Bayesian
optimization (BO) with an artificial neural network kernel to enable smart
search. This method leverages the BO algorithm, where the neural network,
trained on a limited number of DFT results, determines the most promising
regions of the chemical space to explore in subsequent iterations. This
approach aims to discover materials with target properties while minimizing the
number of DFT calculations required. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method, we investigated 63 doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with sizes
ranging from 1 to 2 nm to find the structure with the highest light absorbance.
Using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) only 12 times, we achieved a significant
reduction in computational cost, approximately 20% of what would be required
for a full grid search, by employing the BO algorithm with a neural network
kernel. Considering that TDDFT calculations for a single GQD require about half
a day of wall time on high-performance computing nodes, this reduction is
substantial. Our approach can be generalized to the discovery of new drugs,
chemicals, crystals, and alloys with high-dimensional and large chemical
spaces, offering a scalable solution for various applications in materials
science.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Starting from a particle system with short-range interactions, we derive a continuum model for the bending, torsion, and brittle fracture of inextensible rods moving in three-dimensional space. As the number of particles tends to infinity, it is assumed that the rod's thickness is of the same order as the interatomic distance. Fracture energy in the $Œì$-limit is expressed by an implicit cell formula, which covers different modes of fracture, including (complete) cracks, folds and torsional cracks. In special cases, the cell formula can be significantly simplified. Our approach applies e.g. to atomistic systems with Lennard-Jones-type potentials and is motivated by the research of ceramic nanowires.</p>

The resulting domain pattern with aligned staggered magnetization is long term stable enabling memory applications. We achieve this switching with low heating of 20 K, which is promising regarding fast and efficient devices without the need for thermal activation.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Optical second harmonic generation is a second-order nonlinear process that combines two photons of a given frequency into a third photon at twice the frequency. Due to the symmetry constraints, it is widely used as a sensitive probe to detect broken inversion symmetry and local polar order. Analytical modeling of the electric-dipole SHG response is essential to extract fundamental properties of materials from experiments. However, complexity builds up dramatically in the analytical model when the probed crystal is of a low bulk crystal symmetry, with a low-symmetry surface orientation, exhibits absorption and dispersion, and consists of multiple interfaces. As a result, there is a largely uneven landscape in the literature on the SHG modeling of new materials, involving numerous approximations and a wide range of (in)accuracies, leading to a rather scattered dataset of reported SHG nonlinear susceptibility. Towards streamlining the reliability and accuracy of this process, we have developed an open-source package called the Second Harmonic Analysis of Anisotropic Rotational Polarimetry (SHAARP) which derives analytical solutions and performs numerical simulations of reflection SHG from a single interface for homogeneous crystals. Five key generalizations in SHG modeling are implemented, including all crystal symmetries down to triclinic, any crystal orientation, complex dielectric tensor (refractive indices) with frequency dispersion, and general polarization states of the light. SHAARP enables accurate anisotropic modeling of SHG response for a broad range of materials systems. The method is extendible to multiple interfaces.

    <p>We propose an intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect, which is of band geometric origin, independent of scattering, and scales with the second order of electric field and first order of magnetic field. We show that this effect is less symmetry constrained compared to other nonlinear transport effects and is supported in a large class of nonmagnetic polar and chiral crystals. Its characteristic angular dependence provides an effective way to control the nonlinear output. Combined with first-principles calculations, we evaluate this effect in the Janus monolayer MoSSe and report experimentally measurable results. Our work reveals an intrinsic transport effect, which offers a new tool for material characterization and a new mechanism for nonlinear device application.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A quantum anomalous Hall state with high Chern number has so far been realized in multiplayer structures consisting of alternating magnetic and undoped topological insulator layers. However, in previous proposals, the Chern number can be only tuned by varying the doping concentration or the width of the magnetic topological insulator layers. This drawback largely restrict the applications of dissipationless chiral edge currents in electronics since the number of conducting channels remains fixed. In this work, we propose a way of varying the Chern number at will in these multilayered structures by means of an external electric field applied along the stacking direction. In the presence of an electric field in the stacking direction, the inverted bands of the unbiased structure coalesce and hybridize, generating new inverted bands and collapsing the previously inverted ones. In this way, the number of Chern states can be tuned externally in the sample, without the need of modifying the number and width of the layers or the doping level. We showed that this effect can be uncovered by the variation of the transverse conductance as a function of the electric field at constant injection energy at the Fermi level.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Lithium salts with low coordinating anions like bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) have been the state-of-the-art for PEO-based 'dry' polymer electrolytes for three decades. Plasticizing PEO with TFSI-based ionic liquids (ILs) to form ternary solid polymer electrolytes (TSPEs) increases conductivity and Li$^+$ diffusivity. However, the Li$^+$ transport mechanism is unaffected compared to their 'dry' counterpart and essentially coupled to the dynamics of the polymer host matrix, which limits Li$^+$ transport improvement. Thus, a paradigm shift is hereby suggested: The utilization of more coordinating anions such as trifluoromethanesulfonyl-N-cyanoamide (TFSAM), able to compete with PEO for Li$^+$ solvation to accelerate the Li$^+$ transport and reach higher Li$^+$ transference number. The Li-TFSAM interaction in binary and ternary TFSAM-based electrolytes was probed by experimental methods and discussed in the context of recent computational results. In PEO-based TSPEs, TFSAM drastically accelerates the Li$^+$ transport (increased Li$^+$ transference number by 600$\%$ and Li$^+$ conductivity by 200-300$\%$) and computer simulations reveal that lithium dynamics are effectively re-coupled from polymer to anion dynamics. Finally, this concept of coordinating anions in TSPEs was successfully applied in LFP$||$Li metal cells leading to enhanced capacity retention (86$\%$ after 300 cycles) and an improved rate performance at 2C.</p>

    <p>We present a general analytic approach to spatially resolve the nano-scale
lattice distortion field of strained and defected compact crystals with Bragg
coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI). Our approach relies on fitting a
differentiable forward model simultaneously to multiple BCDI datasets
corresponding to independent Bragg reflections from the same single crystal. It
is designed to be faithful to heterogeneities that potentially manifest as
phase discontinuities in the coherently diffracted wave, such as lattice
dislocations in an imperfect crystal. We retain fidelity to such small features
in the reconstruction process through a Fourier transform -based resampling
algorithm designed to largely avoid the point spread tendencies of commonly
employed interpolation methods. The reconstruction model defined in this manner
brings BCDI reconstruction into the scope of explicit optimization driven by
automatic differentiation. With results from simulations and experimental
diffraction data, we demonstrate significant improvement in the final image
quality compared to conventional phase retrieval, enabled by explicitly
coupling multiple BCDI datasets into the reconstruction loss function.</p>

    <p>A new class of strongly excited plasmonic modes that open access to unprecedented Petavolts per meter electromagnetic fields promise wide-ranging, transformative impact. These modes are constituted by large amplitude oscillations of the ultradense, delocalized free electron Fermi gas which is inherent in conductive media. Here structured semiconductors with appropriate concentration of n-type dopant are introduced to tune the properties of the Fermi gas for matched excitation of an electrostatic, surface "crunch-in" plasmon using readily available electron beams of ten micron overall dimensions and hundreds of picoCoulomb charge launched inside a tube. Strong excitation made possible by matching results in relativistic oscillations of the Fermi electron gas and uncovers unique phenomena. Relativistically induced ballistic electron transport comes about due to relativistic multifold increase in the mean free path. Acquired ballistic transport also leads to unconventional heat deposition beyond the Ohm's law. This explains the absence of observed damage or solid-plasma formation in experiments on interaction of conductive samples with electron bunches shorter than $\rm 10^{-13} seconds$. Furthermore, relativistic momentum leads to copious tunneling of electron gas allowing it to traverse the surface and crunch inside the tube. Relativistic effects along with large, localized variation of Fermi gas density underlying these modes necessitate the kinetic approach coupled with particle-in-cell simulations. Experimental verification of acceleration and focusing of electron beams modeled here using tens of Gigavolts per meter fields excited in semiconductors with $\rm 10^{18}cm^{-3}$ free electron density will pave the way for Petavolts per meter plasmonics.</p>

Long periodic potential caused by the moir√© superstructure induces modulation of electronic properties of the system. In this paper, we numerically calculate optical conductivity of G/hBN under circularly polarized light irradiation. The lack of spatial inversion symmetry in G/hBN induces the valley polarization. In further, the valley polarization becomes most pronounced in the infrared and terahertz regions if the twist angle between two materials is close to zero for non-doping case, however, insensitive with twist angle for hole-doped case. These results will serve to design the valleytronics devices using G/hBN.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Data-driven machine learning methods have the potential to dramatically
accelerate the rate of materials design over conventional human-guided
approaches. These methods would help identify or, in the case of generative
models, even create novel crystal structures of materials with a set of
specified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the
laboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in
developing suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the
machine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations
used in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations
that are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while
remaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing
challenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking
existing non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and
developing an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through
gradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be
coupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials
within the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian
space. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach
using atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional
variational autoencoders as the generative model. We are able to successfully
generate novel and valid atomic structures of sub-nanometer Pt nanoparticles as
a proof of concept. Furthermore, this method can be readily extended to any
suitable structural representation, thereby providing a powerful, generalizable
framework towards structure-based generation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Toughness $\mathcal{T}$ of a brittle polymeric solid can be enhanced by blending another compatible and ductile polymer. While this common wisdom is generally valid, a generic picture is lacking that connects the atomistic details to the macroscopic non-linear mechanics. Using all-atom and complementary generic simulations we show how a delicate balance between the side group contact density of the brittle polymers $œÅ_{\rm c}$ and its dilution upon adding a second component controls $\mathcal{T}$. A broad range of systems follows a universal trend in $\mathcal{T}$ with ${\rm d}œÅ_{\rm c}/{\rm d}\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the tensile strain. The simulation data is consistent with a simple model based on the parallel spring analogy.</p>

    <p>We present an in-situ uniaxial pressure device optimized for small angle X-ray and neutron scattering experiments at low-temperatures and high magnetic fields. A stepper motor generates force, which is transmitted to the sample via a rod with integrated transducer that continuously monitors the force. The device has been designed to generate forces up to 200 N in both compressive and tensile configurations and a feedback control allows operating the system in a continuous-pressure mode as the temperature is changed. The uniaxial pressure device can be used for various instruments and multiple cryostats through simple and exchangeable adapters. It is compatible with multiple sample holders, which can be easily changed depending on the sample properties and the desired experiment and allow rapid sample changes.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Quasi-two-dimensional electron systems (q-2DES) are formed in various hetero-structures, including oxide interfaces. Oxygen vacancies (OVs) in oxides like $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ are known to produce electronic carriers. A novel way to produce $\mathrm{SrTiO_{3-Œ¥}}$ on the surface using a low-energy $\mathrm{H_2}$ plasma is shown here. It results in a q-2DES with mobility as high as $Œº\sim 20,000 \; cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$, displaying quantum oscillations in magneto-resistance. We can achieve a sharper or weaker confinement potential by adjusting the process pressure. The system with sharper confinement displays clearer quantum oscillations and Kondo-like temperature dependence of resistance. OVs close to the surface behaving like a correlated Anderson impurity is responsible for the Kondo behaviour. Quantum oscillations are less prominent in the weakly confined system. A cross-over from weak-localization to anti-localization with temperature is seen, but no Kondo behavior. The process also results in a transparent conductor amenable to lithographic patterning. This conductor's standard figure of merit is comparable to poly-crystalline ITO films in the visible regime and extends with similar performance into the $Œª$ $\sim 1.5$ $Œºm$ telecommunication wavelength.</p>

    <p>Overlaying two graphene layers with a small twist angle can create a moire superlattice to realize exotic phenomena that are entirely absent in graphene monolayer. A representative example is the predicted formation of localized pseudo-Landau levels (PLLs) with Kagome lattice in tiny-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with theta < 0.3 deg when the graphene layers are subjected to different electrostatic potentials. However, this was shown only for the model of rigidly rotated TBG which is not realized in reality due to an interfacial structural reconstruction. It is believed that the interfacial structural reconstruction strongly inhibits the formation of the PLLs. Here, we systematically study electronic properties of the TBG with 0.075 deg < theta < 1.2 deg and demonstrate, unexpectedly, that the PLLs are quite robust for all the studied TBG. The structural reconstruction suppresses the formation of the emergent Kagome lattice in the tiny-angle TBG. However, for the TBG around magic angle, the sample-wide electronic Kagome lattices with tunable lattice constants are directly imaged by using scanning tunneling microscope. Our observations open a new direction to explore exotic correlated phases in moire systems.</p>

    <p>Coordination geometries describe how the neighbours of a central particle are arranged around it. Such geometries can be thought to lie in an abstract topological space; a model of this space could provide a mathematical basis for understanding physical transformations in crystals, liquids, and glasses. With this motivation, the present work proposes a metric model of the space of three-dimensional coordination geometries. This model is conceived through the generalisation of a local orientational order parameter and seems to be consistent with geometric intuition. It appears to suggest a taxonomy of coordination geometries with five main classes, each with a distinct character. A quantitative notion of orientational typicality is introduced and its interplay with orientational order is found to evidence a statistical regularity with respect to point symmetry. By the assertion of axioms on the topology of the space herein modelled, the range of structures that are possible to resolve with the order parameter in molecular dynamics simulations is greatly increased.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In BaNiS2 a Dirac nodal-line band structure exists within a two-dimensional Ni square lattice system, in which significant electronic correlation effects are anticipated. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover signs of correlated-electron behavior, namely electronic nematicity appearing as a pair of C2-symmetry striped patterns in the local density-of-states at ~60 meV above the Fermi energy. In observations of quasiparticle interference, as well as identifying scattering between Dirac cones, we find that the striped patterns in real space stem from a lifting of degeneracy among electron pockets at the Brillouin zone boundary. We infer a momentum-dependent energy shift with d-form factor, which we model numerically within a density wave equation framework that considers spin-fluctuation-driven nematicity. This suggests an unusual mechanism driving the nematic instability, stemming from only a small perturbation to the Fermi surface, in a system with very low density of states at the Fermi energy. The Dirac points lie at nodes of the d-form factor, and are almost unaffected by it. These results highlight BaNiS2 as a unique material in which Dirac electrons and symmetry-breaking electronic correlations coexist.</p>

    <p>In solids, strong repulsion between electrons can inhibit their movement and result in a "Mott" metal-to-insulator transition (MIT), a fundamental phenomenon whose understanding has remained a challenge for over 50 years. A key issue is how the wave-like itinerant electrons change into a localized-like state due to increased interactions. However, observing the MIT in terms of the energy- and momentum-resolved electronic structure of the system, the only direct way to probe both itinerant and localized states, has been elusive. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), that in V$_2$O$_3$ the temperature-induced MIT is characterized by the progressive disappearance of its itinerant conduction band, without any change in its energy-momentum dispersion, and the simultaneous shift to larger binding energies of a quasi-localized state initially located near the Fermi level.</p>

    <p>Stacking two-dimensional layered materials such as graphene and transitional metal dichalcogenides with nonzero interlayer twist angles has recently become attractive because of the emergence of novel physical properties. Stacking of one-dimensional nanomaterials offers the lateral stacking offset as an additional parameter for modulating the resulting material properties. Here, we report that the edge states of twisted bilayer zigzag graphene nanoribbons (TBZGNRs) can be tuned with both the twist angle and the stacking offset. Strong edge state variations in the stacking region are first revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We construct and characterize twisted bilayer zigzag graphene nanoribbon (TBZGNR) systems on a Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy. A detailed analysis of three prototypical orthogonal TBZGNR junctions exhibiting different stacking offsets by means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals emergent near-zero-energy states. From a comparison with DFT calculations, we conclude that the emergent edge states originate from the formation of flat bands whose energy and spin degeneracy are highly tunable with the stacking offset. Our work highlights fundamental differences between 2D and 1D twistronics and spurs further investigation of twisted one-dimensional systems.</p>

    <p>We present a comprehensive experimental and ab-initio study of the $S=1/2$ Mo$^{5+}$ system, KMoOP$_2$O$_7$, and show that it realizes the $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain antiferromagnet model. Powder neutron diffraction reveals that KMoOP$_2$O$_7$ forms a magnetic network comprised of pairs of Mo$^{5+}$ chains within its monoclinic $P2_1/n$ structure. Antiferromagnetic interactions within the Mo$^{5+}$ chains are identified through magnetometry measurements and confirmed by analysis of the magnetic specific heat. The latter reveals a broad feature centred on $T_\textrm{N} = 0.54$ K, which we ascribe to the onset of long-range antiferromagnetic order. No magnetic Bragg scattering is observed in powder neutron diffraction data collected at 0.05 K, however, which is consistent with a strongly suppressed ordered moment with an upper limit $Œº_\textrm{ord} < 0.15 Œº_\textrm{B}$. The one-dimensional character of the magnetic correlations in KMoOP$_2$O$_7$ is verified through analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data, resulting in a model with $J_\textrm{1} \approx 34$ K and $J_\textrm{2} \approx -2$ K for the intrachain and interchain exchange interactions, respectively. The origin of these experimental findings are addressed through density-functional theory calculations.</p>

    <p>Superinsulators offer a unique laboratory realizing strong interaction phenomena like confinement and asymptotic freedom in quantum materials. Recent experiments evidenced that superinsulators are the mirror-twins of superconductors with reversed electric and magnetic field effects. Cooper pairs and Cooper holes in the superinsulator are confined into neutral electric pions by electric strings, with the Cooper pairs playing the role of quarks. Here we report the non-equilibrium relaxation of the electric pions in superinsulating films. We find that the time delay $t_{\mathrm{sh}}$ of the current passage in the superinsulator is related to the applied voltage $V$ via the power law, $t_{\mathrm{sh}}\propto (V-V_{\mathrm p})^{-Œº}$, where $V_{\mathrm p}$ is the effective threshold voltage. Two distinct critical exponents, $Œº=1/2$ and $Œº=3/4$, correspond to jumps from the electric Meissner state to the mixed state and to the superinsulating resistive state with broken charge confinement, respectively. The $Œº=1/2$ value establishes a direct experimental evidence for the electric strings' linear potential confining the charges of opposite signs in the electric Meissner state and effectively rules out disorder-induced localization as a mechanism for superinsulation. We further report the memory effects and their corresponding dynamic critical exponents arising upon the sudden reversal of the applied voltage. Our observations open routes for exploring fundamental strong interaction charge confinement via desktop experiments.</p>

    <p>The coupling of electrons and phonons is governed wisely by the symmetry properties of the crystal structures. In particular, for two-dimensional (2D) systems, it has been suggested that the electrons do not couple to phonons with pure out-of-plane distortion, as long as there is a $œÉ_h$ symmetry. We show that such a statement is correct when constituents of the unit-cell layer are only located in the $œÉ_h$ symmetric plane; a prominent example of such a system is graphene. For those 2D crystals in which atoms are vertically located away from the horizontal symmetric plane (e.g., 1H transition metal dichalcogenides), acoustic flexural modes do not couple to the electrons up to linear order, while optical flexural phonons, which preserve $œÉ_h$ symmetry, do couple with the electrons. Our conclusions are supported by an analytic argument together with numerical calculations using density functional perturbation theory.</p>

    <p>We design and synthesize unentangled associative polymers carrying unprecedented high fractions of stickers, up to eight per Kuhn segment, that can form strong pairwise hydrogen bonding of $\sim20k_BT$ without microphase separation. The reversible bonds significantly slow down the polymer dynamics but nearly do not change the shape of linear viscoelastic spectra. Moreover, the structural relaxation time of associative polymers increases exponentially with the fraction of stickers and exhibits a universal yet non-Arrhenius dependence on the distance from polymer glass transition temperature. These results cannot be understood within the framework of the classic sticky-Rouse model but are rationalized by a renormalized Rouse model, which highlights an unexpected influence of reversible bonds on the structural relaxation rather than the shape of viscoelastic spectra for associative polymers with high concentrations of stickers.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Efficient algorithms to generate candidate crystal structures with good
stability properties can play a key role in data-driven materials discovery.
Here we show that a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) is
capable of generating two-dimensional (2D) materials of high chemical and
structural diversity and formation energies mirroring the training structures.
Specifically, we train the CDVAE on 2615 2D materials with energy above the
convex hull $\Delta H_{\mathrm{hull}}< 0.3$ eV/atom, and generate 5003
materials that we relax using density functional theory (DFT). We also generate
14192 new crystals by systematic element substitution of the training
structures. We find that the generative model and lattice decoration approach
are complementary and yield materials with similar stability properties but
very different crystal structures and chemical compositions. In total we find
11630 predicted new 2D materials, where 8599 of these have $\Delta
H_{\mathrm{hull}}< 0.3$ eV/atom as the seed structures, while 2004 are within
50 meV of the convex hull and could potentially be synthesized. The relaxed
atomic structures of all the materials are available in the open Computational
2D Materials Database (C2DB). Our work establishes the CDVAE as an efficient
and reliable crystal generation machine, and significantly expands the space of
2D materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Magnetic skyrmions, topologically protected chiral spin swirling
quasiparticles, have attracted great attention in fundamental physics and
applications. Recently, the discovery of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals
(vdW) magnets has aroused great interest due to their appealing physical
properties. Moreover, both experimental and theoretical works have revealed
that isotropic Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) can be achieved in 2D
magnets or ferromagnet-based heterostructures. However, 2D magnets with
anisotropic DMI haven't been reported yet. Here, via using first-principles
calculations, we unveil that anisotropic DMI protected by D2d crystal symmetry
can exist in 2D ternary compounds MCuX2. Interestingly, by using micromagnetic
simulations, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic (FM) antiskyrmions, FM bimerons,
antiferromagnetic (AFM) antiskyrmions and AFM bimerons can be realized in MCuX2
family. Our discovery opens up an avenue to creating antiskyrmions and bimerons
with anisotropic DMI protected by D2d crystal symmetry in 2D magnets.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We develop a method combining machine learning (ML) and density functional
theory (DFT) to predict low-energy polymorphs by introducing physics-guided
descriptors based on structural distortion modes. We systematically generate
crystal structures utilizing the distortion modes and compute their energies
with single-point DFT calculations. We then train a ML model to identify
low-energy configurations on the material's high-dimensional potential energy
surface. Here, we use BiFeO3 as a case study and explore its phase space by
tuning the amplitudes of linear combinations of a finite set of distinct
distortion modes. Our procedure is validated by rediscovering several known
metastable phases of BiFeO3 with complex crystal structures, and its efficiency
is proved by identifying 21 new low-energy polymorphs. This approach proposes a
new avenue toward accelerating the prediction of low-energy polymorphs in
solid-state materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Symmetry-protected non-trivial states in chiral topological materials hold
immense potential for fundamental science and technological advances. Here, we
report electrical transport, quantum oscillations, and electronic structure
results of a single crystal of chiral quantum material $\rm PtAl$. Based on the
de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations, we show that the smallest Fermi pocket
($\alpha$) possesses a non-trivial Berry phase $1.16$$\pi$. The band associated
with this Fermi pocket carries a linear energy dispersion over a substantial
energy window of $\sim$700 meV that is further consistent with the calculated
optical conductivity. First-principles calculations unfold that $\rm PtAl$ is a
higher-fold chiral fermion semimetal where structural chirality drives the
chiral fermions to lie at the high-symmetry $\Gamma$ and $R$ points of the
cubic Brillouin zone. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the band crossings
at $\Gamma$ and $\rm R$ points are three- and four-fold degenerate with a
chiral charge of $-2$ and $+2$, respectively. The inclusion of spin-orbit
coupling transforms these crossing points into four- and six-fold degenerate
points with a chiral charge of $-4$ and $+4$. Nontrivial surface states on the
$(001)$ plane connect the bulk projected chiral points through the long helical
Fermi arcs that spread over the entire Brillouin zone.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Understanding substrate effects on spin dynamics and relaxation in two-dimensional (2D) materials is of key importance for spintronics and quantum information applications. However, the key factors that determine the substrate effect on spin relaxation, in particular for materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, have not been well understood. Here we performed first-principles real-time density-matrix dynamics simulations with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and quantum descriptions of electron-phonon and electron-impurity scattering for the spin lifetimes of supported/free-standing germanene, a prototypical strong SOC 2D Dirac material. We show that the effects of different substrates on spin lifetime can surprisingly differ by two orders of magnitude. We find that substrate effects on $œÑ_s$ are closely related to substrate-induced modifications of the SOC-field anisotropy, which changes the spin-flip scattering matrix elements. We propose a new electronic quantity, named spin-flip angle $Œ∏^{\uparrow\downarrow}$, to characterize spin relaxation caused by intervalley spin-flip scattering. We find that the spin relaxation rate is approximately proportional to the averaged value of $\mathrm{sin}^{2}\left(Œ∏^{\uparrow\downarrow}/2\right)$, which can be used as a guiding parameter of controlling spin relaxation.</p>

    <p>Antiferromagnetic materials are exciting quantum materials with rich physics
and great potential for applications. It is highly demanded of the accurate and
efficient theoretical method for determining the critical transition
temperatures, N\'{e}el temperatures, of antiferromagnetic materials. The
powerful graph neural networks (GNN) that succeed in predicting material
properties lose their advantage in predicting magnetic properties due to the
small dataset of magnetic materials, while conventional machine learning models
heavily depend on the quality of material descriptors. We propose a new
strategy to extract high-level material representations by utilizing
self-supervised training of GNN on large-scale unlabeled datasets. According to
the dimensional reduction analysis, we find that the learned knowledge about
elements and magnetism transfers to the generated atomic vector
representations. Compared with popular manually constructed descriptors and
crystal graph convolutional neural networks, self-supervised material
representations can help us obtain a more accurate and efficient model for
N\'{e}el temperatures, and the trained model can successfully predict high
N\'{e}el temperature antiferromagnetic materials. Our self-supervised GNN may
serve as a universal pre-training framework for various material properties.</p>

    <p>The recent emergence of multi-species multi-phase materials provides intriguing opportunities to maximize electrochemical performance in various electrochemical devices. This work summarizes the current understanding of the coupled transport reactions in multi-phase multi-species ionic conductors. We also provide experimental results of the fabrication of multi-phases Na-beta"-alumina+20mol% Scandia Doped Ceria(20SDC) as simultaneous sodium and oxygen ion conductor by a cost-effective vapor phase process demonstrating higher conductivity achieved in a much shorter time than other published results. In this study, two-phase contiguous composites of Al2O3+20SDC are fabricated by conventional ceramic processing and sintering in the air at 1400C 1500C, and 1600C, for 3 hours. The samples are heat-treated while exposed to a sodium oxide vapor source at different time lengths. The conversion mechanism involves coupled transport of sodium ions through newly formed Na-beta"-alumina and oxygen ions through 20SDC. The experimental data are analyzed using diffraction and spectroscopy methods. The samples with finer grains show faster kinetics compared to coarse microstructures due to the presence of more extended triple-phase boundaries (TPB). As a result, the total conductivity of the multi-phase sample compared to that of pure 20SDC is improved by three times, while fabrication time is decreased by 60% compared to Na-beta"-alumina+YSZ.</p>

    <p>The self-assembly of colloidal diamond (CD) crystals is considered as one of
the most coveted goals of nanotechnology, both from the technological and
fundamental points of view. For applications, colloidal diamond is a photonic
crystal which can open new possibilities of manipulating light for information
processing. From a fundamental point of view, its unique symmetry exacerbates a
series of problems that are commonly faced during the self-assembly of target
structures, such as the presence of kinetic traps and the formation of
crystalline defects and alternative structures (polymorphs). Here we
demonstrate that all these problems can be systematically addressed via
SAT-assembly, a design framework that converts self-assembly into a
satisfiability problem. Contrary to previous solutions (requiring four or more
components), we prove that the assembly of the CD crystal only requires a
binary mixture. Moreover, we use molecular dynamics simulations of a system
composed by nearly a million nucleotides to test a DNA nanotechnology design
that constitutes a promising candidate for experimental realization.</p>

    <p>Machine learning (ML) models have been widely successful in the prediction of

Recent advances in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) frameworks capable of

demonstrated superior performance in computer vision and natural language
processing tasks. Drawing inspiration from the developments in SSL, we
introduce Crystal Twins (CT): an SSL method for crystalline materials property

Network (GNN) by applying the redundancy reduction principle to the graph
latent embeddings of augmented instances obtained from the same crystalline

    <p>The microscopic understanding of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been hindered by the apparent complexity of crystal structures in these materials. We used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study an electron-doped copper oxide compound Sr$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$CuO$_2$ that has only bare cations separating the CuO$_2$ planes and thus the simplest infinite-layer structure among all cuprate superconductors. Tunneling conductance spectra of the major CuO$_2$ planes in the superconducting state revealed direct evidence for a nodeless pairing gap, regardless of variation of its magnitude with the local doping of trivalent neodymium. Furthermore, three distinct bosonic modes are observed as multiple peak-dip-hump features outside the superconducting gaps and their respective energies depend little on the spatially varying gaps. Along with the bosonic modes with energies identical to those of the external, bending and stretching phonons of copper oxides, our findings indicate their origin from lattice vibrations rather than spin excitations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work, a temperature-induced valence-state transition is studied in a narrow composition range of Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$TbIrO$_6$. The valence-state transition involves an electron transfer between Tb and Ir leading to the valence-state change between Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ and Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ phases. This first-order transition has a dramatic effect on the lattice, transport properties, and the long-range magnetic order at low temperatures for both Tb and Ir ions. Ir$^{5+}$ ion has an electronic configuration of 5$d^4$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 0) which is expected to be nonmagnetic. In contrast, Ir$^{4+}$ ion with a configuration of 5$d^5$($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) favors a long-range magnetic order. For $x$ = 0.1 with Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ configuration to the lowest temperature (2 K) investigated in this work, a spin-glass behavior is observed around 5 K indicating Ir$^{5+}$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 0) ions act as a spacer reducing the magnetic interactions between Tb$^{3+}$ ions. For $x$ = 0.5 with Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ configuration below the highest temperature 400 K of this work, a long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T\rm_N$ = 40 K is observed highlighting the importance of Ir$^{4+}$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) ions in promoting the long-range magnetic order of both Tb and Ir ions. For 0.2 $\leqslant x \leqslant$ 0.375, a temperature-induced valence-state transition from high-temperature Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ phase to low-temperature Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ phase occurs in the temperature range 180 K $\leqslant T \leqslant$ 325 K and the transition temperature increases with $x$. The compositional dependence demonstrates the ability to tune the the valence state for a critical region of $x$ that leads to a concurrent change in magnetism and structure. This tuning ability could be employed with suitable strain in thin films to act as a switch as the magnetism is manipulated.</p>

    <p>Edible electronics will facilitate point-of-care testing through safe and cheap devices that are digested or degraded in the body or environment after performing a specific function. Its thrive depends on creating a library of materials that are the basic building blocks for eatable technologies. Edible electrical conductors fabricated with green methods that allow production at a large scale and composed of food derivatives, ingestible in large amounts without risk for human health are needed. Here, conductive pastes made with materials with a high tolerable upper intake limit (major of mg/kg body weight /day) are proposed. Conductive oleogel paste composites, made with biodegradable and food-grade materials like natural waxes, oils, and activated carbon conductive fillers, are presented. The proposed pastes are compatible with manufacturing processes such as direct ink writing and thus are suitable for an industrial scale-up. These conductors are built without the use of solvents, and with tunable electromechanical features and adhesion depending on the composition. They have antibacterial and hydrophobic properties, so that they can be used in contact with food preventing contamination and preserving its organoleptic properties. As a proof-of-principle application, the edible conductive pastes are demonstrated to be effective edible contacts for food impedance analysis, to be integrated for example in smart fruit labels for ripening monitoring.</p>

    <p>In a $(2+1)$-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory coupled with a fermion and a scalar, which has $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY in absence of the boundary, the insertion of a spatial boundary breaks the supersymmetry. We show that only a subset of the boundary conditions allowed by the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian can preserve partial $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, while for the remaining boundary conditions SUSY is completely broken. In the latter case, we demonstrate two distinct SUSY-breaking mechanisms. For some of the SUSY-breaking boundary conditions, the SUSY variation of the action does not vanish which explicitly breaks SUSY. While for certain other boundary conditions, despite the invariance of action under SUSY transformations, unpaired fermionic edge states in the domain of the Hamiltonian leads to an anomalous breaking of the supersymmetry.</p>

    <p>Implantation of diamonds with helium ions becomes a common method to create hundreds-nanometers-thick near-surface layers of NV centers for high-sensitivity sensing and imaging applications. However, optimal implantation dose and annealing temperature is still a matter of discussion. In this study, we irradiated HPHT diamonds with an initial nitrogen concentration of 100 ppm using different implantation doses of helium ions to create 200-nm thick NV layers. We compare a previously considered optimal implantation dose of $\sim10^{12}$ to double and triple doses by measuring fluorescence intensity, contrast, and linewidth of magnetic resonances, as well as longitudinal and transversal relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. From these direct measurements we also estimate concentrations of P1 and NV centers. In addition, we compare the three diamond samples that underwent three consequent annealing steps to quantify the impact of processing at 1100 $^{\circ}$C, which follows initial annealing at 800 $^{\circ}$C. By tripling the implantation dose we have increased the magnetic sensitivity of our sensors by $28\pm5$ %. By projecting our results to higher implantation doses we show that a further improvement of up to 70 % may be achieved. At the same time, additional annealing steps at 1100 $^{\circ}$C improve the sensitivity only by 6.6 $\pm$ 2.7 %.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>It is shown that the quadrature derivatives in some analytical gradients of
energies evaluated with a multi-centre radial-angular grid do not vanish even
in the limit of an infinitely dense grid, causing severe errors when neglected.
The gradients in question are those with respect to a lattice constant of a
crystal or to the helical angle of a chain with screw axis symmetry. This is in
contrast with the quadrature derivatives in atomic gradients, which can be made
arbitrarily small by grid extension. The disparate behaviour is traced to
whether the grid points depend on the coordinate with respect to which the
derivative of energy is taken. Whereas the nonvanishing quadrature derivative
in the lattice-constant gradient is identified as the surface integral arising
from an expanding integration domain, the analytical origin of the nonvanishing
quadrature derivative in the helical-angle gradient remains unknown.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The simplest picture of excitons in materials with atomic-like localization
of electrons is that of Frenkel excitons, where electrons and holes stay close
together, which is associated with a large binding energy. Here, using the
example of the layered oxide V$_2$O$_5$ , we show how localized charge-transfer
excitations combine to form excitons that also have a huge binding energy but,
at the same time, a large electron-hole distance, and we explain this seemingly
contradictory finding. The anisotropy of the exciton delocalization is
determined by the local anisotropy of the structure, whereas the exciton
extends orthogonally to the chains formed by the crystal structure. Moreover,
we show that the bright exciton goes together with a dark exciton of even
larger binding energy and more pronounced anisotropy. These findings are
obtained by combining first principles many-body perturbation theory
calculations, ellipsometry experiments, and tight binding modelling, leading to
very good agreement and a consistent picture. Our explanation is general and
can be extended to other materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work, a novel highly fabrication tolerant polarization beam splitter (PBS) is presented on an InP platform. To achieve the splitting, we combine the Pockels effect and the plasma dispersion effect in a symmetric 1x2 Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). One p-i-n phase shifter of the MZI is driven in forward bias to exploit the plasma dispersion effect and modify the phase of both the TE and TM mode. The other arm of the MZI is driven in reverse bias to exploit the Pockels effect which affects only the TE mode. By adjusting the voltages of the two phase shifters, a different interference condition can be set for the TE and the TM modes thereby splitting them at the output of the MZI. By adjusting the voltages, the very tight fabrication tolerances known for fully passive PBS are eased. The experimental results show that an extinction ratio better than 15 dB and an on-chip loss of 3.5 dB over the full C-band (1530-1565nm) are achieved.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) technique for measurements on the micron scale. Spectral acquisition speeds of many orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art modulation spectroscopy setups are demonstrated. The experimental method is based on charge-coupled-device detection, avoiding speed-limiting components, such as polarization modulators with lock-in amplifiers. At the same time, FRS spectra are obtained with a sensitivity of 20 $Œº$rad (0.001$^\circ$) over a broad spectral range (525 nm - 800 nm), which is on par with state-of-the-art polarization-modulation techniques. The new measurement technique also automatically cancels unwanted Faraday rotation backgrounds. Using the setup, we perform Faraday rotation spectroscopy of excitons in a hBN-encapsulated atomically thin semiconductor WS$_2$ under magnetic fields of up to 1.4 T at room temperature and liquid helium temperature. We determine the A exciton g-factor of -4.4 $\pm$ 0.3 at room temperature, and -4.2 $\pm$ 0.2 at liquid helium temperature. In addition, we perform FRS and hysteresis loop measurements on a 20 nm thick film of an amorphous magnetic Tb$_{0.2}$Fe$_{0.8}$ alloy.</p>

    <p>A charge order (CO) with a wavevector $\mathbf{q}\simeq\left(\frac{1}{3},0,0\right)$ is observed in infinite-layer nickelates. Here we use first-principles calculations to demonstrate a charge-transfer-driven CO mechanism in infinite-layer nickelates, which leads to a characteristic Ni$^{1+}$-Ni$^{2+}$-Ni$^{1+}$ stripe state. For every three Ni atoms, due to the presence of near-Fermi-level conduction bands, Hubbard interaction on Ni-$d$ orbitals transfers electrons on one Ni atom to conduction bands and leaves electrons on the other two Ni atoms to become more localized. We further derive a low-energy effective model to elucidate that the CO state arises from a delicate competition between Hubbard interaction on Ni-$d$ orbitals and charge transfer energy between Ni-$d$ orbitals and conduction bands. With physically reasonable parameters, $\mathbf{q}=\left(\frac{1}{3},0,0\right)$ CO state is more stable than uniform paramagnetic state and usual checkerboard antiferromagnetic state. Our work highlights the multi-band nature of infinite-layer nickelates, which leads to some distinctive correlated properties that are not found in cuprates.</p>

    <p>As interdisciplinary science is flourishing because of materials informatics and additional factors; a systematic way is required for expressing knowledge and facilitating communication between scientists in various fields. A function decomposition tree is such a representation, but domain scientists face difficulty in constructing it. Thus, this study cites the general problems encountered by beginners in generating function decomposition trees and proposes a new function decomposition representation method based on a causality-first perspective for resolution of these problems. The causality-first decomposition tree was obtained from a workflow expressed according to the processing sequence. Moreover, we developed a program that performed automatic conversion using the features of the causality-first decomposition trees. The proposed method was applied to materials informatics to demonstrate the systematic representation of expert knowledge and its usefullness.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Self-supervised neural language models have recently achieved unprecedented
success, from natural language processing to learning the languages of
biological sequences and organic molecules. These models have demonstrated
superior performance in the generation, structure classification, and
functional predictions for proteins and molecules with learned representations.
However, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed
for generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to
interpret their design logic. Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a
neural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and
tinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank
filling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique
advantages in learning the "materials grammars" together with high-quality
generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically
valid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\% charge neutrality and
84.8\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher
compared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation
process of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned
materials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the
TCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to
discover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations. Our work
thus brings the unsupervised transformer language models based generative
artificial intelligence to inorganic materials. A user-friendly web app has
been developed for computational materials doping and can be accessed freely at

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Candidate materials for Kitaev spin liquid phase have been intensively studied recently because of their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. Although most of the studies on Kitaev spin liquid have been done in 4$d$ and 5$d$ based transition metal compounds, recently there has been a growing research interest in Co-based quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnets, such as BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ because of formation of spin-orbit-entangled $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 pseudospin moments at Co$^{2+}$ sites and potential realizations of Kitaev-like magnetism therein. Here, we obtain high-accuracy crystal and electronic structure of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ by employing a combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which correctly capture the Mott-insulating nature of the target system. We show that Co$^{2+}$ ions form a high spin configuration, $S=3/2$, with an active $L_{\rm eff}=1$ orbital degree of freedom, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The size of trigonal distortion within CoO$_6$ octahedra is found to be not strong enough to completely quench the orbital degree of freedom, so that the presence of spin-orbit coupling can give rise to the formation of spin-orbit-entangled moments and the Kitaev exchange interaction. Our finding supports recent studies on potential Kitaev magnetism in this compound and other Co-based layered honeycomb systems.</p>

    <p>The key to optimizing spatial resolution in a state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscope is the ability to precisely measure and correct for electron optical aberrations of the probe-forming lenses. Several diagnostic methods for aberration measurement and correction with maximum precision and accuracy have been proposed, albeit often at the cost of relatively long acquisition times. Here, we illustrate how artificial intelligence can be used to provide near-real-time diagnosis of aberrations from individual Ronchigrams. The demonstrated speed of aberration measurement is important as microscope conditions can change rapidly, as well as for the operation of MEMS-based hardware correction elements that have less intrinsic stability than conventional electromagnetic lenses.</p>

Excitation energies and oscillator strengths are computed in order to characterize bright and dark states, and discussed also with respect to the crystal symmetry. Activation of excitonic states is observed for finite transferred momenta: Indeed, we find an active indirect exciton at $\sim$ 0.9 eV, significantly lower than the direct optical gap of 1.96 eV, with excitonic binding energies in the range 0.6-0.9 eV for the lowest states. As for other 2D materials, we find a quasi-linear excitonic dispersion close to $Œì$, which however shows a downward convexity related to the indirect band gap of C$_3$N as well as to the dark nature of the involved excitons.</p>

    <p>Spin-lattice dynamics is used to study the magnetic properties of Fe foams. The temperature dependence of the magnetization in foams is determined as a function of the fraction of surface atoms in foams, nsurf. The Curie temperature of foams decreases approximately linearly with nsurf, while the critical exponent of the magnetization increases considerably more strongly. If the data are plotted as a function of the fraction of surface atoms, reasonable agreement with recent data on vacancy-filled Fe crystals and novel data on void-filled crystals is observed for the critical . Critical temperature and critical exponent also depend on the coordination of surface atoms. Although the decrease we find is relatively small, it hints to the possibility of improved usage of topology to taylor magnetic properties.</p>

    <p>Osmium, the least compressible metal, has recently been observed to undergo
abrupt changes in the c/a ratio at extreme pressures. These are claimed to
provide evidence for two unusual electronic behaviors: a crossing of the
semicore 4f and 5p levels, and an electronic topological transition. We
demonstrate that these two electronic phenomena are readily reproduced and
understood in density functional theory, but that neither perturbs the trend in
c/a ratio against pressure. Hence the observed anomalies in c/a must have
another cause. Osmium is also notable for its high yield stress: the c/a
anomalies lie well within the differential strains which osmium can support. We
propose that observed c/a changes can arise from mechanical yield of
crystallites with strong preferred orientation under high deviatoric stress in
the experimental data. We discuss what evidence remains for the more general
hypothesis that core-level overlap under pressure can have measurable effects
on the crystal structure in any material.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Memristive circuit elements constitute a cornerstone for novel electronic applications, such as neuromorphic computing, called to revolutionize information technologies. By definition, memristors are sensitive to the history of electrical stimuli, to which they respond by varying their electrical resistance across a continuum of nonvolatile states. Recently, much effort has been devoted to developing devices that present an analogous response to optical excitation. Here we realize a new class of device, a tunnelling photo-memristor, whose behaviour is bimodal: both electrical and optical stimuli can trigger the switching across resistance states in a way determined by the dual optical-electrical history. This unique behaviour is obtained in a device of ultimate simplicity: an interface between a high-temperature superconductor and a transparent semiconductor. The microscopic mechanism at play is a reversible nanoscale redox reaction between both materials, whose oxygen content determines the electron tunnelling rate across their interface. Oxygen exchange is controlled here via illumination by exploiting a competition between electrochemistry, photovoltaic effects and photo-assisted ion migration. In addition to their fundamental interest, the unveiled electro-optic memory effects have considerable technological potential. Especially in combination with high-temperature superconductivity which, beyond facilitating the high connectivity required in neuromorphic circuits, brings photo-memristive effects to the realm of superconducting electronics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The temperature evolution of the resonant Raman scattering from high-quality bilayer 2H-MoS$_{2}$ encapsulated in hexagonal BN flakes is presented. The observed resonant Raman scattering spectrum as initiated by the laser energy of 1.96 eV, close to the A excitonic resonance, shows rich and distinct vibrational features that are otherwise not observed in non-resonant scattering. The appearance of 1$^{st}$ and 2$^{nd}$ order phonon modes is unambiguously observed in a broad range of temperatures from 5 K to 320 K. The spectrum includes the Raman-active modes, $i.e.$ E$_\textrm{1g}^{2}$($Œì$) and A$_\textrm{1g}$($Œì$) along with their Davydov-split counterparts, $i.e.$ E$_\textrm{1u}$($Œì$) and B$_\textrm{1u}$($Œì$). The temperature evolution of the Raman scattering spectrum brings forward key observations, as the integrated intensity profiles of different phonon modes show diverse trends. The Raman-active A$_{1g}$($Œì$) mode, which dominates the Raman scattering spectrum at $T$=5~K quenches with increasing temperature. Surprisingly, at room temperature the B$_\textrm{1u}$($Œì$) mode, which is infrared-active in the bilayer, is substantially stronger than its nominally Raman-active A$_\textrm{1g}$($Œì$) counterpart.</p>

    <p>High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements were taken on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0, 0.04, and 0.08) superconductors. With an ultrahigh energy resolution of 0.4 meV, unusual two hole bands near the Brillouin-zone center, which was possibly a result of additional symmetry breaking, were identified in all the sulfur-substituted samples. In addition, in both of the hole bands highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with resolution limited nodes were evidenced. We find that the larger superconducting gap on the outer hole band is reduced linearly to the nematic transition temperature while the gap on the inner hole is nearly S-substitution independent. Our observations strongly suggest that the superconducting gap increases with enhanced nematicity although the superconducting transition temperature is not only governed by the pairing strength, demonstrating strong constraints on theories in the FeSe family.</p>

    <p>Using molecular dynamics simulation, we present a comprehensive study of the volatile thermal degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) across a temperature range of 300 K to 1823 K. We find that degradation at temperatures higher than $\sim$ 1373 K generates significant quantities of reducing gases such as CH$_{\text{n}}$ and hydrogen molecules which are beneficial to the steelmaking industry. Our results provide a new understanding of HDPE's phase transformation from solid to gas that occurs during superheating at steelmaking's electric arc furnace environment offering a new method for eliminating end-of-life HDPE from landfill.</p>

    <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a family of layered materials exhibiting rich exotic phenomena, such as valley-contrasting physics. Down to single-particle level, unraveling fundamental physics and potential applications including quantum information processing in these materials attracts significant research interests. To unlock these great potentials, gate-controlled quantum dot architectures have been applied in 2D materials and their heterostructures. Such systems provide the possibility of electrical confinement, control, and manipulation of single carriers in these materials. In this review, efforts in gate-controlled quantum dots in 2D materials are presented. Following basic introductions to valley degree of freedom and gate-controlled quantum dot systems, the up-to-date progress in etched and gate-defined quantum dots in 2D materials, especially in graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, is provided. The challenges and opportunities for future developments in this field, from views of device design, fabrication scheme, and control technology, are discussed. The rapid progress in this field not only sheds light on the understanding of spin-valley physics, but also provides an ideal platform for investigating diverse condensed matter physics phenomena and realizing quantum computation in the 2D limit.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Every practical method to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for interacting many-particle systems introduces approximations. Such methods are therefore plagued by systematic errors. For computational chemistry, it is decisive to quantify the specific error for some system under consideration. Traditionally, the primary resource for such an error assessment have been benchmarking results, usually taken from the literature. However, their transferability to a specific molecular system, and hence, the reliability of the traditional approach always remains uncertain to some degree. In this communication, we elaborate on the shortcomings of this traditional way of static benchmarking by exploiting statistical analyses at the example of one of the largest quantum chemical benchmark sets available. We demonstrate the uncertainty of error estimates in the light of the choice of reference data selected for a benchmark study. To alleviate the issues with static benchmarks, we advocate to rely instead on a rolling and system-focused approach for rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of a quantum chemical result.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using density-functional theory (DFT) and its extension to DFT+$U$, we propose a possible scenario for a strain-induced metal-insulator transition which has been reported recently in thin films of SrCrO$_3$. The metal-insulator transition involves the emergence of a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion similar to the case of the related rare-earth vanadates, which also exhibit a nominal $d^2$ occupation of the transition metal cation. Our calculations indicate that, for realistic values of the Hubbard $U$ parameter, the unstrained system exhibts a C-type antiferromagnetically ordered ground state, that is already rather close to a JT instability. However, the emergence of the JT distortion is disfavored by the large energetic overlap of the $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ band with the lower lying $d_{xy}$ band. Tensile epitaxial strain lowers the energy of the $d_{xy}$ band relative to $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ and thus brings the system closer to the nominal filling of $d_{xy}^1(d_{xz}d_{yz})^1$. The JT distortion then lifts the degeneracy between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals and thus allows to open up a gap in the electronic band structure.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Electron hydrodynamics arises when momentum-relaxing scattering processes are
slow compared to momentum-conserving ones. While the microscopic details
necessary to satisfy this condition are material-specific, experimentally
accessible current densities share remarkable similarities. We study the
dependence of electron hydrodynamic flows on the rates of momentum-relaxing and
momentum-conserving scattering processes in a microscopics-agnostic way. We
develop a framework for generating random collision operators which respect
crystal symmetries and conservation laws and which have a tunable ratio between
the momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing lifetimes. Using various random
instances of these collision operators, we calculate macroscopic electron
viscosity tensors and solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in a channel
geometry over a grid of momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing lifetimes,
and for different crystal symmetry groups. We find that different random
collision operators using the same lifetimes produce very similar current
density profiles, meaning that the current density is primarily a probe of the
overall rates of momentum conservation and relaxation. By contrast, the
viscosity tensor varies substantially at fixed lifetimes, meaning that
properties like channel resistance provide detailed probes of the underlying
scattering processes. This suggests that, while details of the scattering
process are imprinted in the electronic viscosity tensor, for many applications
theoretical calculations of hydrodynamic electron flows can use
experimentally-available lifetimes within a spatially-resolved BTE framework
rather than requiring the costly computation of ab initio collision operators.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We investigate the dynamics of an injection locked in-plane uniform spin torque oscillator for several forcing configurations at large driving amplitudes. For the analysis, the spin wave amplitude equation is used to reduce the dynamics to a general oscillator equation in which the forcing is a complex valued function $F(p,œà)\proptoŒµ_1 (p)cos(œà)+iŒµ_2 (p)sin(œà)$. Assuming that the oscillator is strongly nonisochronous and/or forced by a power forcing $(|ŒΩŒµ_1/Œµ_2 |\gg 1)$, we show that the parameters $Œµ_{1,2} (p)$ govern the main bifurcation features of the Arnold tongue diagram : (i) the locking range asymmetry is mainly controlled by $dŒµ_1 (p)/dp$, (ii) the Taken-Bogdanov bifurcation occurs for a power threshold depending on $Œµ_{1,2} (p)$ and (iii) the frequency hysteretic range is related to the transient regime through the resonant frequency at zero mismatch frequency. Then, the model is compared with the macrospin simulation for driving amplitudes as large as $10^0-10^3 A/m$ for the magnetic field and $10^{10}-10^{12} A/m^2$ for the current density. As predicted by the model, the forcing configuration (nature of the driving signal, applied direction, the harmonic orders) affects substantially the oscillator dynamic. However, some discrepancies are observed. In particular, the prediction of the frequency and power locking range boundaries may be misestimated if the hysteretic boundaries are of same magnitude order. Moreover, the misestimation can be of two different types according if the bifurcation is Saddle node or Taken Bogdanov. These effects are a further manifestation of the complexity of the dynamics in nonisochronous auto-oscillators.</p>

    <p>Pd$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ has been proposed to be topologically non-trivial in nature. However, evidence of its non-trivial behavior is still unexplored. We report the growth and magneto-transport study of Pd$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ thin films, revealing for the first time the contribution of two-dimensional (2D) topological surface states. We observe exceptional non-saturated linear magnetoresistance which results from Dirac fermions inhabiting the lowest Landau level in the quantum limit. The transverse magnetoresistance changes from a semi-classical weak-field $B^{2}$ dependence to a high-field $B$ dependence at a critical field $B^{\star}$. It is found that $B^{\star} \propto T^2$, which is expected from the Landau level splitting of a linear energy dispersion. In addition, the magnetoconductivity shows signatures of 2D weak anti-localization (WAL). These novel magnetotransport signatures evince the presence of 2D Dirac fermions in Pd$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ thin films.</p>

    <p>The structural, electronic, lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and superconducting properties of the alkali-metal hydride RbH, metalized through electron-doping by the construction of the solid-solution Rb$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$H, are systematically analyzed as a function of Sr-content within the framework of density functional perturbation and Migdal-Eliashberg theories, taking into account the effect of zero-point energy contribution by the quasi-harmonic approximation. For the entire studied range of Sr-content, steady increments of the electron-phonon coupling constant and the superconducting critical temperature are found with progressive alkaline-earth metal content through electron-doping, reaching the values of $Œª=1.92$ and $T_c=51.3(66.1)$~K with $Œº^*$=0.1(0). The steady rise of such quantities as a function of Sr-content is consequence of the metallization of the hydride as an increase of density of states at the Fermi level is observed, as well as the softening of the phonon spectrum, mainly coming from H-optical modes. Our results indicate that electron-doping on metal-hydrides is an encouraging alternative to look for superconductivity without applied pressure.</p>

    <p>Magnetic resonances driven by current-induced torques are crucial tools to study magnetic materials but are very limited in frequency and mechanical efficiency. We propose an alternative mechanism, voltage-induced torque, to realize high efficiency in generating high-frequency magnetization dynamics. When a ferromagnet-topological insulator-ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure is operated as an adiabatic quantum motor, voltage-induced torque arises from the adiabatic motion of gapped topological electrons on the two interfaces and act oppositely on the two ferromagnetic layers, which can excite the exchange mode where the two ferromagnetic layers precess with a $œÄ$-phase difference. The exchange mode resonance, bearing a much higher frequency than the ferromagnetic resonance, is accompanied by topological charge pumping, leading to a sharp peak in electrical admittance at the resonance point. Because the output current is purely adiabatic while dissipative current vanishes identically, the proposed voltage-driven exchange resonance entails a remarkably high mechanical efficiency close to unity, which is impossible in any current-driven systems.</p>

    <p>Controllable topological phase transitions are appealing as they allow for tunable single particle electronic properties. Here, by using state-of-the-art manybody perturbation theory techniques, we show that the topological $Z_2$ phase transition occurring in the single particle spectrum of the recently synthetized ethynylene bridged polyacene polymers is accompanied by a topological excitonic phase transition: the band inversion in the non-trivial phase yields real-space exciton wave functions in which electrons and holes exchange orbital characters with respect to the trivial phase. The topological excitonic phase transition results in a broad tunability of the singlet-triplet splittings, opening appealing perspectives for the occurrence of singlet fission. Finally, the flatness of the single-particle electronic structure in the topological non trivial phase leads to negatively dispersing triplet excitons in a large portion of the Brillouin zone, opening a route for spontaneously coherent energy transport at room temperature.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The curious occurrence of perfectly spherical particles when a steel substrate is slid against a hard abrasive was first observed and documented by Robert Hooke in the 17$^{th}$ century. Similar particles have subsequently been observed in numerous other abrasion-type processes, ranging from grinding of steels to sliding rock faults. The prevalent hypothesis, originally proposed by Hooke, is that these particles are formed due to high local temperatures between the abrasive and the substrate, resulting in melting, droplet ejection and subsequent resolidification -- the melting-resolidification hypothesis. In this work, we revisit this phenomenon using \emph{in situ} analysis of a model steel-abrasive contact geometry, complemented by analytical calculations. It is found that the temperature within the contact zone, for typical contact conditions used, is far from the melting point and that spherical particles do not form in the absence of oxygen. We thereby propose a modification of the melting-resolidification hypothesis, involving an intermediate exothermic oxidation stage, and provide quantitative evidence for each step of the process. Our results have implications for a wide class of abrasive systems that involve the formation and utilization of spherical metallic particles</p>

The macroscopic Maxwell equations that describe oblique light propagation are transformed into one-dimensional wave equations. As an illustration of the method, light propagation at oblique incidence on a silicon thin film is presented.</p>

    <p>We report the synthesis of powder and single-crystal samples of the cerium pyrohafnate and their characterization using neutron diffraction, thermogravimetry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We evaluate the amount of non-magnetic Ce$^{4+}$ defects and use this result to interpret the spectrum of crystal-electric field transitions observed using inelastic neutron scattering. The analysis of these single-ion transitions indicates the dipole-octupole nature of the ground state doublet and a significant degree of spin-lattice coupling. The single-ion properties calculated from the crystal-electric field parameters obtained spectroscopically are in good agreement with bulk magnetic susceptibility data down to about 1 K. Below this temperature, the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility indicates a correlated regime without showing any sign of magnetic long-range order or freezing down to 0.08 K. We conclude that Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_{7}$ is another candidate to investigate exotic correlated states of quantum matter such as the octupolar quantum spin ice recently argued to exist in the isostructural compounds Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.</p>

    <p>Semiconductor materials provide a compelling platform for quantum
technologies (QT), and the properties of a vast amount of materials can be
found in databases containing information from both experimental and
theoretical explorations. However, searching these databases to find promising
candidate materials for quantum technology applications is a major challenge.
Therefore, we have developed a framework for the automated discovery of
semiconductor host platforms for QT using material informatics and machine
learning methods, resulting in a dataset consisting of over $25.000$ materials
and nearly $5000$ physics-informed features. Three approaches were devised,
named the Ferrenti, extended Ferrenti and the empirical approach, to label data
for the supervised machine learning (ML) methods logistic regression, decision
trees, random forests and gradient boosting. We find that of the three, the
empirical approach relying exclusively on findings from the literature
predicted substantially fewer candidates than the other two approaches with a
clear distinction between suitable and unsuitable candidates when comparing the
two largest eigenvalues in the covariance matrix. In contrast to expectations
from the literature and that found for the Ferrenti and extended Ferrenti
approaches focusing on band gap and ionic character, the ML methods from the
empirical approach highlighted features related to symmetry and crystal
structure, including bond length, orientation and radial distribution, as
influential when predicting a material as suitable for QT. All three approaches
and all four ML methods agreed on a subset of $47$ eligible candidates %(to a
probability of $>50 \ \%$) of $8$ elemental, $29$ binary, and $10$ tertiary
compounds, and provide a basis for further material explorations towards
quantum technology.</p>

    <p>The transfer and control of angular momentum is a key aspect for spintronic applications. Only recently, it was shown that it is possible to transfer angular momentum from the spin system to the lattice on ultrashort time scales. In an attempt to contribute to the understanding of angular momentum transfer between spin and lattice degrees of freedom we present a scheme to calculate fully-relativistic spin-lattice coupling parameters from first-principles. By treating changes in the spin configuration and atomic positions at the same level, closed expressions for the atomic spin-lattice coupling parameters can be derived in a coherent manner up to any order. Analyzing the properties of these parameters, in particular their dependence on spin-orbit coupling, we find that even in bcc Fe the leading term for the angular momentum exchange between the spin system and the lattice is a Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya-type interaction, which is due to the symmetry breaking distortion of the lattice.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Optimization strategies driven by machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or materials. Although many of these constraints are known a priori, they can be interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate their practical utility in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the synthesis of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions, and the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic accessibility constraints. The tools developed constitute a simple, yet versatile strategy to enable model-based optimization with known experimental constraints, contributing to its applicability as a core component of autonomous platforms for scientific discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Electron-hole bound pairs, or excitons, are common excitations in semiconductors. They can spontaneously form and ``condense'' into a new insulating ground state -- the so-called excitonic insulator -- when the energy of electron-hole Coulomb attraction exceeds the band gap. In the presence of electron-phonon coupling, a periodic lattice distortion often concomitantly occurs with this exciton condensation. However, similar structural transition can also be induced by electron-phonon coupling itself, therefore hindering the clean identification of bulk excitonic insulators based on reductionistic reasoning (e.g. which instability is the ``driving force'' of the phase transition). Using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques, we identify key electron-phonon coupling effects in a leading excitonic insulator candidate Ta2NiSe5. These include an extensive unidirectional lattice fluctuation and an electronic pseudogap in the normal state, as well as a negative electronic compressibility in the charge-doped broken-symmetry state. In combination with first principles and model calculations, we determine a minimal lattice model and the corresponding interaction parameters that capture the experimental observations. More importantly, we show how the Coulomb and electron-phonon coupling effects can be separated on the level of lattice model, and demonstrate a general framework beyond the reductionist approach in the investigation of correlated systems with intertwined orders.</p>

    <p>How local stresses propagate through polymeric fluids, and, more generally, how macromolecular dynamics give rise to viscoelasticity are open questions vital to wide-ranging scientific and industrial fields. Here, to unambiguously connect polymer dynamics to force response, and map stress propagation in macromolecular materials, we present a powerful approach-Optical Tweezers integrating Differential Dynamic Microscopy (OpTiDMM)-that simultaneously imposes local strains, measures resistive forces, and analyzes the motion of the surrounding polymers. Our measurements with blends of ring and linear polymers (DNA) and their composites with stiff polymers (microtubules) uncover a surprising resonant response, in which affine alignment, superdiffusivity, and elastic memory are maximized when the strain rate is comparable to the entanglement rate. Microtubules suppress this resonance, while substantially increasing elastic force and memory, due to varying degrees to which the polymers buildup, stretch and flow along the strain path, and configurationally dissipate stress. More broadly, the rich multi-scale coupling of mechanics and dynamics afforded by OpTiDDM, empowers its interdisciplinary use to elucidate non-trivial phenomena that sculpt stress propagation dynamics-critical to commercial applications and cell mechanics alike.</p>

    <p>Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are theoretically able to concentrate both direct and diffuse solar radiation with extremely high efficiencies. Photon-multiplier luminescent solar concentrators (PM-LSCs) contain chromophores which exceed 100\% photoluminescence quantum efficiency. PM-LSCs have recently been experimentally demonstrated and hold promise to outcompete traditional LSCs. However, we find that the thermodynamic limits of PM-LSCs are different and are sometimes more extreme relative to traditional LSCs. As might be expected, to achieve very high concentration factors a PM-LSC design must also include a free energy change, analogous to the Stokes shift in traditional LSCs. Notably, unlike LSCs, the maximum concentration ratio of a PM-LSC is dependent on brightness of the incident photon field. For some brightnesses, but equivalent energy loss, the PM-LSC has a greater maximum concentration factor than that of the traditional LSC. We find that the thermodynamic requirements to achieve highly concentrating PM-LSCs differ from traditional LSCs. The new model gives insight into the limits of concentration of PM-LSCs and may be used to extract design rules for further PM-LSC design.</p>

    <p>Chemical substitution is a promising route for the exploration of a rich variety of doping- and/or disorder-dependent collective phenomena in low-dimensional quantum materials. Here we show that transition metal dichalcogenide alloys are ideal platforms to this purpose. In particular, we demonstrate the emergence of superconductivity in the otherwise metallic single-layer TaSe$_{2}$ by minute electron doping provided by substitutional W atoms. We investigate the temperature- and magnetic field-dependence of the superconducting state of Ta$_{1-Œ¥}$W$_Œ¥$Se$_2$ with electron doping ($Œ¥$) using variable temperature (0.34 K - 4.2 K) scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). We unveil the emergence of a superconducting dome spanning 0.003 < $Œ¥$ < 0.03 with a maximized critical temperature of 0.9 K, a significant increase from that of bulk TaSe$_{2}$ (T$_C$ = 0.14 K). Superconductivity emerges from an increase of the density of states (DOS) as the Fermi surface approaches a van Hove singularity due to doping. Once the singularity is reached, however, the DOS decreases with $Œ¥$, which gradually weakens the superconducting state, thus shaping the superconducting dome. Lastly, our doping-dependent measurements allow us to unambiguously track the development of a Coulomb glass phase triggered by disorder due to W dopants.</p>

    <p>The uniform electron gas (UEG), a hypothetical system with finite homogenous electron density composed by an infinite number of electrons in a box of infinite volume, is the practical pillar of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the most acclaimed approximation of DFT, the local-density approximation (LDA). In the last thirty years, the knowledge of analytical parametrizations of the infinite UEG (IUEG) exchange-correlation energy has allowed researchers to perform a countless number of approximate electronic structure calculations for atoms, molecules, and solids. Recently, it has been shown that the traditional concept of the IUEG is not the unique example of UEGs, and systems, in their lowest-energy state, consisting of electrons that are confined to the surface of a sphere provide a new family of UEGs with more customizable properties. Here, we show that, some of the excited states associated with these systems can be classified as transient UEGs (TUEGs) as their electron density is only homogenous for very specific values of the radius of the sphere even though the electronic wave function is not rotationally invariant. Concrete examples are provided in the case of two-electron systems.</p>

    <p>Graphene is attracting vast interest due to its superior electronic and mechanical properties. However, structure and electronic properties of its edge are often neglected, although they are important for nanoscale devices because the edge ratio becomes larger by decreasing the device size. In this study, we suggest a way to fabricate a graphene with atomically aligned zigzag edges by applying hydrogen-plasma etching (HPE) technique. By patterning a graphene prior to HPE, it is succeeded to shape a graphene in desired structure. Both atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirm that the graphene shaped by this technique preserves its honeycomb structure even on the edge, which is aligned with zigzag structure. Although the mechanism of the anisotropic etching by hydrogen-plasma have not been clarified yet, the sample position dependence of the etching rate suggests that the hydrogen-radicals are responsible for the anisotropic etching.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Non-magnetic impurities in iron-based superconductors can provide an important tool to understand the pair symmetry and they can influence significantly the transport and the superconducting behaviour. Here, we present a study of the role of strong impurity potential in the Fe plane, induced by Cu substitution, on the electronic and superconducting properties of single crystals of FeSe. The addition of Cu quickly suppresses both the nematic and superconducting states, and increases the residual resistivity due to enhanced impurity scattering. Using magnetotransport data up to 35 T for a small amount of Cu impurity, we detect a significant reduction in the mobility of the charge carriers by a factor of ~3. While the electronic conduction is strongly disrupted by Cu substitution, we identify additional signatures of anisotropic scattering which manifest in linear resistivity at low temperatures and $H^{1.6}$ dependence of magnetoresistance. The suppression of superconductivity by Cu substitution is consistent with a sign-changing $s_{\pm}$ order parameter. Additionally, in the presence of compressive strain, the superconductivity is enhanced, similar to FeSe.</p>

    <p>Spectral/angular emissivity $e$ and absorptivity $Œ±$ of an object are widely believed to be identical by Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation in reciprocal systems, but this introduces an intrinsic and inevitable energy loss for energy conversion and harvesting devices. So far, experimental evidences of breaking this well-known balance are still absent, and previous theoretical proposals are restricted to narrow single-band nonreciprocal radiation. Here we observe for the first time, to our knowledge, the violation of Kirchhoff's law using ultrathin ($<Œª/40$, $Œª$ is the working wavelength) magnetized InAs semiconductor films at epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) frequencies. Large difference of $|Œ±-e|>0.6$ has been experimentally demonstrated under a moderate external magnetic field. Moreover, based on magnetized ENZ building blocks supporting asymmetrically radiative Berreman and surface ENZ modes, we show versatile shaping of nonreciprocal thermal radiation: single-band, dual-band, and broadband nonreciprocal emission spectra at different wavebands. Our findings of breaking Kirchhoff's law will advance the conventional understanding of emission and absorption processes of natural objects, and lay a solid foundation for more comprehensive studies in designing various nonreciprocal thermal emitters. The reported recipe of diversely shaping nonreciprocal emission will also breed new possibilities in renovating next-generation nonreciprocal energy devices in the areas of solar cells, thermophotovoltaic, radiative cooling, etc.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Due to the small photon momentum, optical spectroscopy commonly probes magnetic excitations only at the center of the Brillouin zone; however, there are ways to override this restriction. In the case of the distorted kagome quantum magnet Y-kapellasite, Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_8$, under scrutiny here, the magnon density of states can be accessed over the entire Brillouin zone through three-center magnon excitations. This mechanism is aided by the three different magnetic sublattices and strong short-range correlations in the distorted kagome lattice. The results of THz time-domain experiments agree remarkably well with linear spin-wave theory. Relaxing the conventional zone-center constraint of photons gives a new aspect to probe magnetism in matter.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>An effective numerical method is presented for optimizing model parameters that can be applied to any type of system of non-linear equations and any number of data-points, which does not require explicit formulation of the objective function or its partial derivatives. The numerics are reduced to solving a non-linear least squares problem, which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the Jacobian is approximated by applying rank-one updates using Broyden's method. An advantage of this methodology over conventional approaches is that the partial derivatives of the objective function do not have to be analytically calculated. For instance, there may be situations where one cannot formulate the partial derivatives, such as cases involving an objective function that itself contains a nested optimization problem. Moreover, a line search algorithm is also described that ensures that the Armijo conditions are satisfied and that convergence is assured, which makes the success of the approach insensitive to the initial estimates of the model parameters. The foregoing numerical methods are described with respect to the development of the Optima software to solve inverse problems, which are reduced to non-linear least squares problems. This computational approach has proven to be particularly useful at solving inverse problems of very complex physical models that cannot be optimized directly in a practical way.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Colloidal dispersions are prized as model systems to understand basic properties of materials, and are central to a wide range of industries from cosmetics to foods to agrichemicals. Among the key developments in using colloids to address challenges in condensed matter is to resolve the particle coordinates in 3D, allowing a level of analysis usually only possible in computer simulation. However in amorphous materials, relating mechanical properties to microscopic structure remains problematic. This makes it rather hard to understand, for example, mechanical failure. Here we address this challenge by studying the contacts and the forces between particles, as well as their positions. To do so, we use a colloidal model system (an emulsion) in which the interparticle forces and local stress can be linked to the microscopic structure. We demonstrate the potential of our method to reveal insights into the failure mechanisms of soft amorphous solids by determining local stress in a colloidal gel. In particular, we identify `force chains' of load-bearing droplets, and local stress anisotropy, and investigate their connection with locally rigid packings of the droplets.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The monolithic integration of extended short-wave infrared (e-SWIR) photodetectors (PDs) on silicon is highly sought-after to implement manufacturable, cost-effective sensing and imaging technologies. With this perspective, GeSn PIN PDs have been the subject of extensive investigations because of their bandgap tunability and silicon compatibility. However, due to growth defects, these PDs suffer a relatively high dark current density as compared to commercial III-V PDs. Herein, we elucidate the mechanisms governing the dark current in $2.6 \, Œº$m GeSn PDs at a Sn content of $10$ at.%. It was found that in the temperature range of $293 \, $K -- $363 \,$K and at low bias, the diffusion and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) leakage mechanisms dominate the dark current in small diameter ($20 \, Œº$m) devices, while combined SRH and trap assisted tunneling (TAT) leakage mechanisms are prominent in larger diameter ($160 \, Œº$m) devices. However, at high reverse bias, TAT leakage mechanism becomes dominant regardless of the operating temperature and device size. The effective non-radiative carrier lifetime in these devices was found to reach $\sim 300$ -- $400$ ps at low bias. Owing to TAT leakage current, however, this lifetime reduces progressively as the bias increases.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>When the particle size of a metal is reduced, it is expected that an energy gap will open due to the quantum size effect. However, the energy gap in platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles has not been observed directly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). To investigate the particle size dependence of the electronic state of Pt nanoparticles, we performed 195Pt NMR experiments on thiol-capped Pt nanoparticles with three different average diameters of less than 3 nm. For the nanoparticles with a diameter of 2.8 nm, we observed usual metallic behavior with a smaller density of states than that of the bulk Pt. In contrast, the temperature dependence of 1/T1T in nanoparticles less than 2.5 nm in diameter is an activation-energy form above 150 K, which is semiconducting behavior with an energy gap of the order of 2000 K. The significant decrease in 1/T1T by more than two orders of magnitude in the smaller Pt nanoparticles compared to the bulk Pt is attributable to the disappearance of the density of states at the Fermi energy, which is consistent with the opening of an energy gap. These results indicate a metal-insulator transition below 2.5 nm in diameter is present in our thiol-capped Pt nanoparticle samples. The effect of the thiol capping on the electronic structure suggested by the experimental results is also discussed.</p>

    <p>Establishing a data-driven pipeline for the discovery of novel materials
requires the engineering of material features that can be feasibly calculated
and can be applied to predict a material's target properties. Here we propose a
new class of descriptors for describing crystal structures, which we term
Robust One-Shot Ab initio (ROSA) descriptors. ROSA is computationally cheap and
is shown to accurately predict a range of material properties. These simple and
intuitive class of descriptors are generated from the energetics of a material
at a low level of theory using an incomplete ab initio calculation. We
demonstrate how the incorporation of ROSA descriptors in ML-based property
prediction leads to accurate predictions over a wide range of crystals,
amorphized crystals, metal-organic frameworks and molecules. We believe that
the low computational cost and ease of use of these descriptors will
significantly improve ML-based predictions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We use the method of field decomposition, a technique widely used in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, to study the small velocity approximation (SVA) of the Lorentz transformation in Maxwell equations for slowly moving media. The "deformed" Maxwell equations derived under the SVA in the lab frame can be put into the conventional form of Maxwell equations in the medium's comoving frame. Our results show that the Lorentz transformation in the SVA up to $O(v/c)$ ($v$ is the speed of the medium and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum) is essential to derive these equations: the time and charge density must also change when transforming to a different frame even in the SVA, not just the position and current density as in the Galilean transformation. This marks the essential difference of the Lorentz transformation from the Galilean one. We show that the integral forms of Faraday and Ampere equations for slowly moving surfaces are consistent with Maxwell equations. We also present Faraday equation the covariant integral form in which the electromotive force can be defined as a Lorentz scalar independent of the observer's frame. No evidences exist to support an extension or modification of Maxwell equations.</p>

    <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been thoroughly investigated due to their formally divergent Q-factor, especially those emerging in all-dielectric, nanostructured metasurfaces from symmetry protection at the $Œì$ point (in-plane wavevector $k_{||}=0$). Less attention has been paid to accidental BICs that may appear at any other $k_{||}\not =0$ in the band structure of supported modes, being in turn difficult to predict. Here we make use of a coupled electric/magnetic dipole model to determine analytical conditions for the emergence of accidental BICs, valid for any planar array of meta-atoms that can be described by dipolar resonances, which is the case of many nanostructures in the optical domain. This is explored for all-dielectric nanospheres through explicit analytical conditions that allow us in turn to predict accidental BIC positions in the parameter space $(œâ,\bf{k_{||}}$). Finally, such conditions are exploited to determine not only single, but also double (for both linear polarizations) accidental BICs occurring at the same position in the dispersion relation $œâ-\bf{k_{||}}$ for realistic semiconductor nanodisk meta-atoms. This might pave the way to a variety of BIC-enhanced light-matter interaction phenomena at the nanoscale such as lasing or non-linear conversion, that benefit from emerging at wavevectors away from the $Œì$ point (off-normal incidence) overlapping for both linear polarizations.</p>

    <p>Although much effort has been made to explore quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in both theory and experiment, the QAHE systems with tunable Chern numbers are yet limited. Here, we theoretically propose that NiAsO$_3$ and PdSbO$_3$, monolayer transitional metal oxides, can realize QAHE with tunable Chern numbers via manipulating their magnetization orientations. When the magnetization lies in the \textit{x-y} plane and all mirror symmetries are broken, the low-Chern-number (i.e., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$) phase emerges. When the magnetization exhibits non-zero \textit{z}-direction component, the system enters the high-Chern-number (i.e., $\mathcal{C}=\pm3$) phase, even in the presence of canted magnetization. The global band gap can approach the room-temperature energy scale in monolayer PdSbO$_3$ (23.4 meV), when the magnetization is aligned to \textit{z}-direction. By using Wannier-based tight-binding model, we establish the phase diagram of magnetization induced topological phase transition. Our work provides a high-temperature QAHE system with tunable Chern number for the practical electronic application.</p>

    <p>Data-driven schemes that associate molecular and crystal structures with
their microscopic properties share the need for a concise, effective

models rely on descriptions of atom-centered environments, that are associated
with an atomic property or with an atomic contribution to an extensive
macroscopic quantity. Frameworks in this class can be understood in terms of
atom-centered density correlations (ACDC), that are used as a basis for a
body-ordered, symmetry-adapted expansion of the targets. Several other schemes,
that gather information on the relationship between neighboring atoms using
"message-passing" ideas, cannot be directly mapped to correlations centered
around a single atom. We generalize the ACDC framework to include
multi-centered information, generating representations that provide a complete
linear basis to regress symmetric functions of atomic coordinates, and provides
a coherent foundation to systematize our understanding of both atom-centered
and message-passing, invariant and equivariant machine-learning schemes.</p>

    <p>We compute the correlated electronic structure of stacked $1T$-TaS$_2$ bilayers using the $GW$ + EDMFT method. Depending on the surface termination, the semi-infinite uncorrelated system is either band-insulating or exhibits a metallic surface state. For realistic values of the onsite and intersite interactions, a Mott gap opens in the surface state, but this gap is smaller than the gap originating from the bilayer structure. Our results are consistent with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements for different terminating layers, and with our own photoemission measurements, which indicate the coexistence of spatial regions with different gaps in the electronic spectrum.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Fundamental differences between materials originate from the unique nature of
their constituent chemical elements. Before specific differences emerge
according to the precise ratios of elements in a given crystal structure, a
material can be represented by the set of its constituent chemical elements. By
working at the level of the periodic table, assessment of materials at the
level of their phase fields reduces the combinatorial complexity to accelerate
screening, and circumvents the challenges associated with composition-level
approaches such as poor extrapolation within phase fields, and the
impossibility of exhaustive sampling. This early stage discrimination combined
with evaluation of novelty of phase fields aligns with the outstanding
experimental challenge of identifying new areas of chemistry to investigate, by
prioritising which elements to combine in a reaction. Here, we demonstrate that
phase fields can be assessed with respect to the maximum expected value of a
target functional property and ranked according to chemical novelty. We develop
and present PhaseSelect, an end-to-end machine learning model that combines the
representation, classification, regression and ranking of phase fields. First,
PhaseSelect constructs elemental characteristics from the co-occurrence of
chemical elements in computationally and experimentally reported materials,
then it employs attention mechanisms to learn representation for phase fields
and assess their functional performance. At the level of the periodic table,
PhaseSelect quantifies the probability of observing a functional property,
estimates its value within a phase field and also ranks a phase field novelty,
which we demonstrate with significant accuracy for three avenues of materials
applications for high-temperature superconductivity, high-temperature
magnetism, and targeted bandgap energy.</p>

    <p>The magnetic ground states of $R_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and $A_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with $R=$ Pr, Gd, Ho, and Er, as well as $A=$ Ca, Cd are predicted devising a combination of the cluster-multipole (CMP) theory and spin-density-functional theory (SDFT). The strong electronic correlation effects are estimated by the constrained-random-phase approximation (cRPA) and taken into account within the dynamical-mean-field theory (DMFT). The target compounds feature $d$-orbital magnetism on Ru$^{4+}$ and Ru$^{5+}$ ions for $R$ and $A$, respectively, as well as $f$-orbital magnetism on the $R$ site, which leads to an intriguing interplay of magnetic interactions in a strongly correlated system. We find CMP+SDFT is capable of describing the magnetic ground states in these compounds. The cRPA captures a difference in the screening strength between $R_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and $A_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ compounds, which leads to a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the electronic properties within DMFT.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work we employ an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network to predict the failure locations of porous metal tension specimens based only on their initial porosities. The process we model is complex, with a progression from initial void nucleation, to saturation, and ultimately failure. The objective of predicting failure locations presents an extreme case of class imbalance since most of the material in the specimens do not fail. In response to this challenge, we develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of data- and loss-based regularization methods. Since there is considerable sensitivity of the failure location to the particular configuration of voids, we also use variational inference to provide uncertainties for the neural network predictions. We connect the deterministic and Bayesian convolutional neural networks at a theoretical level to explain how variational inference regularizes the training and predictions. We demonstrate that the resulting predicted variances are effective in ranking the locations that are most likely to fail in any given specimen.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The origin of water on the Earth is a long-standing mystery, requiring a comprehensive search for hydrous compounds, stable at conditions of the deep Earth and made of Earth-abundant elements. Previous studies usually focused on the current range of pressure-temperature conditions in the Earth's mantle and ignored a possible difference in the past, such as the stage of the core-mantle separation. Here, using ab initio evolutionary structure prediction, we find that only two magnesium hydrosilicate phases are stable at megabar pressures, $Œ±$-Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ and $Œ≤$-Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$, stable at 262-338 GPa and >338 GPa,respectively (all these pressures now lie within the Earth's iron core). Both are superionic conductors with quasi-one-dimensional proton diffusion at relevant conditions. In the first 30 million years of Earth's history, before the Earth's core was formed, these must have existed in the Earth, hosting much of Earth's water. As dense iron alloys segregated to form the Earth's core, Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ phases decomposed and released water. Thus, now-extinct Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ phases have likely contributed in a major way to the evolution of our planet.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Quantum materials can display physical phenomena rooted in the geometry of electronic wavefunctions. The corresponding geometric tensor is characterized by an emergent field known as Berry curvature (BC). Large BCs typically arise when electronic states with different spin, orbital or sublattice quantum numbers hybridize at finite crystal momentum. In all materials known to date, the BC is triggered by the hybridization of a single type of quantum number. Here, we report the discovery of the first material system having both spin and orbital-sourced BC: LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces grown along the [111] direction. We detect independently these two sources and directly probe the BC associated to the spin quantum number through measurements of an anomalous planar Hall effect. The observation of a nonlinear Hall effect with time-reversal symmetry signals large orbital-mediated BC dipoles. The coexistence of different forms of BC enables the combination of spintronic and optoelectronic functionalities in a single material.</p>

    <p>Periodic graphs are graphs consisting of repetitive local structures, such as
crystal nets and polygon mesh. Their generative modeling has great potential in
real-world applications such as material design and graphics synthesis.
Classical models either rely on domain-specific predefined generation
principles (e.g., in crystal net design), or follow geometry-based prescribed
rules. Recently, deep generative models has shown great promise in
automatically generating general graphs. However, their advancement into
periodic graphs have not been well explored due to several key challenges in 1)
maintaining graph periodicity; 2) disentangling local and global patterns; and
3) efficiency in learning repetitive patterns. To address them, this paper
proposes Periodical-Graph Disentangled Variational Auto-encoder (PGD-VAE), a
new deep generative models for periodic graphs that can automatically learn,
disentangle, and generate local and global graph patterns. Specifically, we
develop a new periodic graph encoder consisting of global-pattern encoder and
local-pattern encoder that ensures to disentangle the representation into
global and local semantics. We then propose a new periodic graph decoder
consisting of local structure decoder, neighborhood decoder, and global
structure decoder, as well as the assembler of their outputs that guarantees
periodicity. Moreover, we design a new model learning objective that helps
ensure the invariance of local-semantic representations for the graphs with the
same local structure. Comprehensive experimental evaluations have been
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code of
proposed PGD-VAE is availabe at https://github.com/shi-yu-wang/PGD-VAE.</p>

    <p>Metal nanoparticles have a substantial impact across different fields of science, such as photochemistry, energy conversion, and medicine. Among the commonly used nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles are of special interest due to their antibacterial properties and applications in sensing and catalysis. However, many of the methods used to synthesize silver nanoparticles often do not result in well-defined products, the main obstacles being high polydispersity or a lack of particle size tunability. We describe an automated approach to on-demand synthesis of adjustable particles with mean radii of 3 and 5 nm using the polyol route. The polyol process is a promising route for silver nanoparticles e.g., to be used as reference materials. We characterised the as-synthesized nanoparticles using small-angle X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering and further methods, showing that automated synthesis can yield colloids with reproducible and tuneable properties.</p>

    <p>The charge state of dielectric surfaces in aqueous environments is of fundamental and technological importance. Here, we study the influence of dissolved molecular CO$_2$ on the charging of three, chemically different surfaces (SiO$_2$, Polystyrene, Perfluorooctadecyltrichlorosilane). We determine their charge state from electrokinetic experiments. We compare an ideal, CO$_2$-free reference system to a system equilibrated against ambient CO$_2$ conditions. In the reference system, the salt-dependence is weakened for SiO$_2$ and inverted for the organic surfaces. We show that screening and pH-driven charge regulation alone cannot explain the observed effects. As additional cause, we tentatively suggest dielectric regulation of surface charges due to a diffusively adsorbed thin layer of molecular CO$_2$. The formation of such a dynamic layer even at the hydrophilic and partially ionized silica surfaces is supported by a minimal theoretical model and results from molecular simulations.</p>

    <p>Characterizing meltpool shape and geometry is essential in metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) to control the printing process and avoid defects. Predicting meltpool flaws based on process parameters and powder material is difficult due to the complex nature of MAM process. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be useful in connecting process parameters to the type of flaws in the meltpool. In this work, we introduced a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML for melt pool characterization. An extensive experimental dataset has been collected from more than 80 MAM articles containing MAM processing conditions, materials, meltpool dimensions, meltpool modes and flaw types. We introduced physics-aware MAM featurization, versatile ML models, and evaluation metrics to create a comprehensive learning framework for meltpool defect and geometry prediction. This benchmark can serve as a basis for melt pool control and process optimization. In addition, data-driven explicit models have been identified to estimate meltpool geometry from process parameters and material properties which outperform Rosenthal estimation for meltpool geometry while maintaining interpretability.</p>

    <p>The coexistence of different ferroelectric phases enables the tunability of
the macroscopic properties and extensive applications from piezoelectric
transducers to nonvolatile memories. Here we develop a thermodynamic model to
predict the stability and low-energy orientations of boundaries between
different phases in ferroelectrics. Taking lead zirconate titanate and bismuth
ferrite as two examples, we demonstrate that the low-energy orientations of
interphase boundaries are largely determined by minimizing the electrostatic
and elastic energies. Phase-field simulations are employed to analyze the
competition between the interfacial energy and the electrostatic and elastic
energies. Our simulation results demonstrate that the lowering of crystal
symmetry could occur due to the electrical and mechanical incompatibilities
between the two phases, which can be used to explain the experimentally
observed low-symmetry phases near morphotropic phase boundaries. Our work
provides theoretical foundations for understanding and controlling the
interphase boundaries in ferroelectric materials for multifunctional
applications.</p>

    <p>We use time-resolved hard x-ray diffraction to investigate the structural dynamics of the multiferroic insulator TbMnO$_3$ in the low temperature antiferromagnetic and ferroelectrically ordered phase. The lattice response following photoexcitation at 1.55 eV is detected by measuring the (0 2 4) and (1 3 -5) Bragg reflections. A 0.02% tensile strain, normal to the surface, is seen to arise within 20 - 30 ps. The magnitude of this transient strain is over an order of magnitude lower than that predicted from laser-induced heating, which we attribute to a bottleneck in the energy transfer between the electronic and lattice subsystems. The timescale for the transient expansion is consistent with that of previously reported demagnetization dynamics. We discuss a possible relationship between structural and demagnetization dynamics in TbMnO$_3$, in which photoinduced atomic motion modulates the exchange interaction, leading to a destruction of the magnetic order in the system.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The use of simple, fast and economic experimental tools to characterize low-dimensional materials is an important step in the process of democratizing the use of such materials in laboratories around the world. Raman spectroscopy has arisen as a way of indirectly determining the thickness of nanolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), avoiding the use of more expensive tools such as atomic force microscopy, and it is therefore a widely used technique in the study of semiconducting TMDs. However, the study of many metallic TMDs in the limit of few atomic layers is still behind when compared to their semiconducting counterparts, partly due to the lack of similar alternative characterization studies. In this work we present the characterization of the Raman spectrum, specifically of the E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes, of mechanically exfoliated crystals of Ta$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$S$_2$, a metallic TMD which exhibits charge density wave formation and superconductivity. The clear identification of contributions to the Raman spectrum coming from the SiO$_2$/Si substrate, which overlap with the peaks coming from the sample, and which dominate in intensity in the few-layer-samples limit, allowed the isolation of the individual E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes of the samples and, for the first time, the observation of a clear evolution of the Raman shifts of both modes as a function of sample thickness. The evolution of such peaks qualitatively resembles the evolution seen in other TMDs, and provide a way of indirectly determining sample thickness in the limit of few atomic layers at a low cost. In addition, we observe a softening (red-shift) of both E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes with Mo-doping in the nanolayers, possibly related to the increased out-of-plane lattice parameter with respect to the pure compound.</p>

    <p>Samarium doped Na$_2$O-ZnO-TeO$_2$ (NZT) glasses were prepared by the melt quenching method. The glass-forming ability and glass stability of prepared glass was estimated by Hruby parameter using Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Thermo-gravimetric Analysis (TGA). The study of FTIR spectra and X-ray diffraction described the ionic nature and the amorphous pattern of glass respectively. The absorption peaks were observed for the transitions 6H5/2-4P3/2 at 402 nm,6H5/2-4M19/2 at 418 nm, 6H5/2-4I15/2 at 462 nm and 6H5/2-4I11/2 at 478 nm in the absorption spectra. The optical band gap energy (Eg) was calculated and observed to be decreased from 2.95 eV to 1.50 eV with doping concentration. The visible emission band was observed in the Sm3+ doped glass samples. The variation of dielectric constant with frequency was found to be independent for the frequency range 3 kHz - 2 MHz. The measurement of temperature-dependent dc conductivity showed Arrhenius type mechanism of conduction.</p>

    <p>Magnetic vortex is topologically nontrivial and commonly found in ferromagnetic nanodisks. So far, three classes spin-wave eigenmodes, i.e., gyrotropic, azimuthal and radial modes, have been identified in ferromagnetic nanodisks. Here, using micromagnetic simulation and analytical calculation, we reveal twisted spin-wave modes in a thick permalloy (Ni0.8Fe0.2) nanodisk. The twisted spin-waves carry topological charges, which sign depends on the core polarity of the magnetic vortex in the nanodisk. By applying rotating magnetic fields at one end of the sample, we observe continuous generation of twisted spin-waves that have characteristic spiral phase front and carry topological charge l = 1, -1, 2 and -2. The dispersion relation of twisted spin-waves is derived analytically and the result is in good agreement with micromagnetic numerical calculations.</p>

    <p>Micromagnetic small-angle neutron scattering theory is well established for analyzing spin-misalignment scattering data of bulk ferromagnets. Here, this theory is extended to allow for a global uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (texture) of the material, in addition to the already included random zero-average local anisotropy. Macroscopic cross-sections and spin-misalignment response functions are computed analytically for several practically relevant mutual anisotropy and external magnetic field orientations in both parallel and perpendicular scattering geometries for field magnitudes both above and below the rotational saturation. Some of these expressions are tested on published experimental data of magnetic-field-annealed Vitroperm and plastically-deformed Ni, allowing to determine the corresponding global uniaxial anisotropy quality factors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We theoretically predict a new working principle for optical amplification, based on Weyl semimetals: when a Weyl semimetal is suitably irradiated at two frequencies, electrons close to the Weyl points convert energy between the frequencies through the mechanism of topological frequency conversion from [Martin et al, PRX 7 041008 (2017)]. Each electron converts energy at a quantized rate given by an integer multiple of Planck's constant multiplied by the product of the two frequencies. In simulations, we show that optimal, but feasible band structures can support topological frequency conversion in the "THz gap" at intensities down to $ 2{\rm W}/{\rm mm^2}$; the gain from the effect can exceed the dissipative loss when the frequencies are larger than the relaxation time of the system. Topological frequency conversion provides a new paradigm for optical amplification, and further extends Weyl semimetals' promise for technological applications.</p>

    <p>Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) models, defined on $D$-dimensional simple cubic lattice, are paradigmatic toy models for studying $D$-th order topology and corner-localized, mid-gap states. Under periodic boundary conditions, the Wilson loops of non-Abelian Berry connection of BBH models along all high-symmetry axes have been argued to exhibit gapped spectra, which predict gapped surface-states under open boundary conditions. In this work, we identify 1D, 2D, and 3D topological invariants for characterizing higher order topological insulators. Further, we demonstrate the existence of cubic-symmetry-protected, gapless spectra of Wilson loops and surface-states along the body diagonal directions of the Brillouin zone of BBH models. We show the gapless surface-states are described by $2^{D-1}$-component, massless Dirac fermions. Thus, BBH models can exhibit the signatures of first and $D$-th order topological insulators, depending on the details of externally imposed boundary conditions.</p>

    <p>Here, we report first principles calculations and analysis of laser-induced photocurrents at the surface of a prototype Rashba system. By referring to Keldysh non-equilibrium formalism combined with the Wannier interpolation scheme we perform first-principles electronic structure calculations of a prototype BiAg$_2$ surface alloy, which is a well-known material realization of the Rashba model. In addition to non-magnetic ground state situation we also study the case of in-plane magnetized BiAg$_2$. We calculate the laser-induced charge photocurrents for the ferromagnetic case and the laser-induced spin photocurrents for both the non-magnetic and the ferromagnetic cases. Our results confirm the emergence of very large in-plane photocurrents as predicted by the Rashba model. The resulting photocurrents satisfy all the symmetry restrictions with respect to the light helicity and the magnetization direction. We provide microscopic insights into the symmetry and magnitude of the computed currents based on the ab-initio multi-band electronic structure of the system, and scrutinize the importance of resonant two-band and three-band transitions for driven currents, thereby establishing a benchmark picture of photocurrents at Rashba-like surfaces and interfaces. Our work contributes to the study of the role of the interfacial Rashba spin-orbit interaction as a mechanism for the generation of in-plane photocurrents, which are of great interest in the field of ultrafast and terahertz spintronics.</p>

    <p>Many metallic transition-metal oxides turn insulating when grown as films that are only a few unit-cells thick. The microscopic origins of these thickness induced metal-to-insulator transitions however remain under dispute. Here, we simulate the extreme case of a monolayer of an inconspicuous correlated metal -- the strontium vanadate SrVO$_3$ -- deposited on a SrTiO$_3$ substrate. Crucially, our system can have a termination to vacuum consisting of either a SrO or a VO$_2$ top layer. While we find that both lead to Mott insulating behavior at nominal stoichiometry, the phase diagram emerging upon doping -- chemically or through an applied gate voltage -- is qualitatively different. Indeed, our many-body calculations reveal a cornucopia of nonlocal fluctuations associated with (in)commensurate antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, as well as stripe and checkerboard orbital ordering instabilities. Identifying that the two geometries yield crystal-field splittings of opposite signs, we elucidate the ensuing phases through the lens of the orbital degrees of freedom. Quite generally, our work highlights that interface and surface reconstruction and the deformation or severing of coordination polyhedra in ultra-thin films drive rich properties that are radically different from the material's bulk physics.</p>

    <p>Industrial use of ultrashort-pulse surface structuring would significantly increase by an effective utilization of the average laser powers available currently. However, the unexplained degradation of surfaces processed with numerous pulses at high average laser power makes this difficult. Based on a systematic experimental study, the structure formation underlying such surface degradation was investigated. We presented a hierarchical structural formation model that bridges the gap between laser-induced periodic surface structures and surface degradation. Contrary to expectations based on previous research, we observed less structure formation on titanium for high laser fluences. As a possible reason, enhanced electron diffusion with increasing intensity was investigated within the framework of the two-temperature model. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms involved in surface structuring with ultrashort pulses.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The recently discovered layered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$(A=K, Rb, Cs) have attracted much attention because of their unique combination of superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW) order, and nontrivial band topology. The CDW order with an in-plane 2x2 reconstruction is found to exhibit exotic properties, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking and rotational symmetry breaking. However, the nature of the CDW, including its dimensionality, structural pattern, and effect on electronic structure, remains elusive despite intense research efforts. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we unveil for the first time characteristic double-band splittings and band reconstructions, as well as the band gap resulting from band folding, in the CDW phase. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we unambiguously show that the CDW in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from the intrinsic coexistence of Star-of-David and Tri-Hexagonal distortions. The alternating stacking of these two distortions naturally leads to three-dimensional 2x2x2 or 2x2x4 CDW order. Our results provide crucial insights into the nature and distortion pattern of the CDW order, thereby laying down the basis for a substantiated understanding of the exotic properties in the family of AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals.</p>

    <p>The formation of Frohlich polaron in metal halide perovskites, arising from the charge carrierlongitudinal optical (LO) phonon coupling, has been proposed to explain their exceptional properties, but the effective identification of polaron in these materials is still a challenge task. Herein, we theoretically present the infrared optical absorption of Frohlich polaron based on Huang-Rhys model. We find that multiphonon overtones are appeared as the energy of incident photon matches the multiple LO phonons, wherein the average phonon numbers of a polaron can be directly evaluated by the order of the strongest overtone. These multiphonon structures sensitively depend on the scale of electronic distribution in the ground state and the dimensionality of the perovskite materials, which gives the enlightenment for the effective modulation of competing processes between the polaron formation and carrier cooling. Moreover, the order of the strongest overtone shifts to the higher ones with temperature, providing a potential proof of the carriers mobility affected by LO phonons scattering. The present model not only suggests a direct way to verify Frohlich polaron, but also enriches the understanding of the polaron properties in metal halide perovskites.</p>

    <p>Message-passing neural networks (MPNN) have shown extremely high efficiency
and accuracy in predicting the physical properties of molecules and crystals,
and are expected to become the next-generation material simulation tool after
the density functional theory (DFT). However, there is currently a lack of a
general MPNN framework for directly predicting the tensor properties of the
crystals. In this work, a general framework for the prediction of tensor
properties was proposed: the tensor property of a crystal can be decomposed
into the average of the tensor contributions of all the atoms in the crystal,
and the tensor contribution of each atom can be expanded as the sum of the
tensor projections in the directions of the edges connecting the atoms. On this
basis, the edge-based expansions of force vectors, Born effective charges
(BECs), dielectric (DL) and piezoelectric (PZ) tensors were proposed. These
expansions are rotationally equivariant, while the coefficients in these tensor
expansions are rotationally invariant scalars which are similar to physical
quantities such as formation energy and band gap. The advantage of this tensor
prediction framework is that it does not require the network itself to be
equivariant. Therefore, in this work, we directly designed the edge-based
tensor prediction graph neural network (ETGNN) model on the basis of the
invariant graph neural network to predict tensors. The validity and high
precision of this tensor prediction framework were shown by the tests of ETGNN
on the extended systems, random perturbed structures and JARVIS-DFT datasets.
This tensor prediction framework is general for nearly all the GNNs and can
achieve higher accuracy with more advanced GNNs in the future.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The radiative response of any object is governed by a surface parameter known as emissivity. Tuning the emissivity of surfaces has been of great interest in many applications involving thermal radiation such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal management systems, and passive radiative cooling. Although several surface engineering techniques (e.g., surface functionalization) have been pursued to alter the emissivity, there exists a knowledge gap in precisely predicting the emissivity of a surface prior to the modification/fabrication process. Predicting emissivity by a physics-based modeling approach is challenging due to surface's contributing factors, complex interactions and interdependence, and measuring the emissivity requires a tedious procedure for every sample. Thus, a new approach is much-needed to systematically predict the emissivity and expand the applications of thermal radiation. In this work, we demonstrate the immense advantage of employing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the emissivity of complex surfaces. For this aim, we fabricated 116 bulk aluminum 6061 samples with various surface characteristics using femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP). A comprehensive dataset was established by collecting surface characteristic data, laser operating parameters, and measured emissivities for all samples. We demonstrated the application of AI in two distinct scenarios. First, the range of emissivity of an unknown sample was shown to be estimated correctly solely based on its 3D surface morphology image. Second, the emissivity of a sample was precisely predicted based on its surface characteristics data and fabrication parameters. The implementation of the AI techniques resulted in the highly accurate prediction of emissivity by showing excellent agreement with the measurements.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The success of machine learning (ML) in materials property prediction depends
heavily on how the materials are represented for learning. Two dominant
families of material descriptors exist, one that encodes crystal structure in
the representation and the other that only uses stoichiometric information with
the hope of discovering new materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) in
particular have excelled in predicting material properties within chemical
accuracy. However, current GNNs are limited to only one of the above two
avenues owing to the little overlap between respective material
representations. Here, we introduce a new concept of formula graph which
unifies stoichiometry-only and structure-based material descriptors. We further
develop a self-attention integrated GNN that assimilates a formula graph and
show that the proposed architecture produces material embeddings transferable
between the two domains. Our model can outperform some previously proposed
structure-agnostic models and their structure-based counterparts while
exhibiting better sample efficiency and faster convergence. Finally, the model
is applied in a challenging exemplar to predict the complex dielectric function
of materials and nominate new substances that potentially exhibit
epsilon-near-zero phenomena.</p>

    <p>The intersections of topology, geometry and strong correlations offer many opportunities for exotic quantum phases to emerge in condensed matter systems. Weyl fermions, in particular, provide an ideal platform for exploring the dynamical instabilities of single-particle physics under interactions. Despite its fundamental role in relativistic field theory, the concept of causality and the associated spacetime light cone and event horizon has not been considered in connection with interacting Weyl fermionic excitations in quantum matter. Here, by using charge-density wave (CDW) as an example, we unveil the behavior of interacting Weyl fermions and show that a Weyl fermion in a system can open a band gap by interacting only with other Weyl fermions that lie within its energy-momentum dispersion cone. In this sense, causal connections or interactions are only possible within overlapping dispersion cones and each dispersion cone thus constitutes a solid-state analogue of the more conventional `event horizon' of high-energy physics. Our study provides a universal framework for considering interacting relativistic quasiparticles in condensed matter by separating them into energy-like and momentum-like relationships in analogy with the time-like and space-like events in high-energy physics. Finally, we consider two different candidate materials for hosting the Weyl CDW phase: (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. Our study greatly enriches the phenomenology and unveils new connections between condensed matter and high-energy physics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Defects in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) greatly influence their optoelectronic properties. Identification and better understanding of defects existing in OIHPs is an essential step towards fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells. However, direct visualizing the defects is still a challenge for OIHPs due to their sensitivity during electron microscopy characterizations. Here, by using low dose scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques, we observe the common existence of antiphase boundary (APB) in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPbI$_3$), resolve its atomic structure, and correlate it to the electrical/ionic activities and structural instabilities. Such an APB is caused by the half-unit-cell shift of [PbI$_6$]$_4$-octahedron along the [100]/[010] direction, leading to the transformation from corner-sharing [PbI$_6$]$_4$-octahedron in bulk MAPbI$_3$ into edge-sharing ones at the APB. Based on the identified atomic-scale configuration, we further carry out density functional theory calculations and reveal that the APB in MAPbI$_3$ repels both electrons and holes while serves as a fast ion-migration channel, causing a rapid decomposition into PbI$_2$ that is detrimental to optoelectronic performance. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between structures and optoelectronic properties of OIHPs and suggest that controlling the APB is essential for their stability.</p>

    <p>Graphene plasmons are able to become the fundermental of novel conceptual photonic devices, resulting from their unique characteristics containing excitation at room temperature and tunable spectral selectivity in different frequencies. The pursuit of efficiently exciting and manipulating graphene plasmons is necessary and significant for high-performance devices. Here, we investigate graphene plasmon wave propagating in ferroelectric nanocavity array. We experimentally show that the the periodic ferroelectric polarizations could be used for doping graphene into desired spatial carrier density patterns. Based on a theoretical model that considers periodic ununiform conductivity across graphene sheet, the simulation results show surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) in graphene can be excited by an incident light in a similar way to the excitation of photonic crystal resonant modes. The graphene SPP resonance can be tuned from ~720 to ~1 000 cm-1 by rescaling the ferroelectric nanocavity array, and from ~540 to ~780 cm-1 by dynamically changing the applied gate voltage. Our strategy of graphene carrier engineering to excite SPP offers a promissing way for large-scale, non-destructive fabrication of novel graphene photonic devices.</p>

    <p>Vanadium dioxide (VO2) as a phase-change material controls the transferred heat during phase transition process between metal and insulator states. At temperature above 68C, the rutile structure VO2 keeps the heat out and increases the IR radiation reflectivity, while at the lower temperature the monoclinic structure VO2 acts as the transparent material and increase the transmission radiation. In this paper, we first present the metal-insulator phase transition (MIT) of the VO2 in high and low temperatures. Then we simulate the meta-surface VO2 of metamaterial reflector by Ansys HFSS to show the emittance tunability of the rutile and monoclinic phase of the VO2. In next section, we will review the recent progress in the deposition of thermochromic VO2 on glass and silicon substrate with modifying the pressure of sputtering gases and temperature of the substrate. Finally, we present the results of the in-situ sputtered VOx thin film on thick SiO2 substrate in different combination of oxygen and argon environment by V2O5 target at temperature higher than 300C and then, analyze it with x-ray diffraction (XRD) method. The thermochromic VO2 based metamaterial structures open a new route to the passive energy-efficient optical solar reflector in the past few years.</p>

    <p>Near-bandgap photoemission spectroscopy experiments were performed on p-GaN and p-InGaN/GaN photocathodes activated to negative electron affinity. The photoemission quantum yield of the InGaN samples drops by more than one order of magnitude when the temperature is decreased while it remains constant on the GaN sample. This indicates a freezing of photoelectron transport in p-InGaN that we attribute to electron localization in the fluctuating potential induced by the alloy disorder. This interpretation is confirmed by the disappearence at low temperature of the peak in the photoemission spectrum that corresponds to the contribution of the photoelectrons relaxed at the bottom of the InGaN conduction band.</p>

    <p>The equation of state of the triclinic compound
1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) as well as its second-order
isothermal elastic tensor were computed through classical molecular dynamics
simulations under various temperature and pressure conditions. Hydrostatic
pressures similar to previous diamond anvil cell experiments were imposed
within the range [0, 66] GPa and temperatures chosen between 100 and 900 K in
conjunction with the most recent version of an all-atom fully-flexible molecule
force field. The isothermal elastic constants were computed using the
generalized Hooke's law by fitting Cauchy stress vs. linear strain curves.
Along isobaric pathways, TATB single crystal stiffness is found to undergo
linear softening, less pronounced at high pressure, while maintaining its
elastic anisotropy. On the other hand, along an isothermal pathways, a
non-linear increase is observed in the elastic constants with a significant
decrease in anisotropy. Towards a precise mesoscopic modeling of TATB single
crystal mechanical behavior, we provide "ready to plug-in" analytical
formulations of the P,V,T equation of state and pressure-temperature dependent

    <p>Spin-charge interconversion is a very active direction in spintronics. Yet, the complex behaviour of some of the most promising systems such as SrTiO$_3$ (STO) interfaces is not fully understood. Here, on the basis of a 6-band $\boldsymbol{k.p}$ method combined with spin-resolved scattering theory, we give a theoretical demonstration of transverse spin-charge interconversion physics in STO Rashba interfaces. Calculations involve injection of spin current from a ferromagnetic contact by resonant tunneling into the native Rashba-split resonant levels of the STO triangular quantum well. We compute an asymmetric tunneling electronic transmission yielding a transverse charge current flowing in plane, with a dependence with gate voltage in a very good agreement with existing experimental data.</p>

It aims to outline the current state of our understanding of layered nickelates and to show how the analysis of these fascinating materials can shed light on fundamental questions in modern electronic structure theory. A prime focus is determining how the interacting physics defined over a wide energy range can be estimated and "downfolded" into a low energy theory that would describe the relevant degrees of freedom on the $\sim 0.5$ eV scale and that could be solved to determine superconducting and spin and charge density wave phase boundaries, temperature-dependent resistivities, and dynamical susceptibilities.</p>

    <p>Recent reports of superconductivity at KTaO3 (KTO) (110) and (111) interfaces have sparked intense interest due to the relatively high critical temperature as well as other properties that distinguish this system from the more extensively studied SrTiO3 (STO)-based heterostructures. Here we report nanoscale control of the metal-to-insulator transition at the LaAlO3/KTO (110) and (111) interfaces. Devices are created using two distinct methods previously developed for STO-based heterostructures: (1) conductive atomic-force microscopy lithography and (2) ultra-low-voltage electron-beam lithography. At low temperatures, KTO-based devices show superconductivity that is tunable by an applied back gate. A nanowire device shows single-electron-transistor (SET) behavior. These reconfigurable methods of creating nanoscale devices in KTO-based heterostructures offer new avenues for investigating mechanisms of superconductivity as well as development of quantum devices that incorporate strong spin-orbit interactions, superconducting behavior, and nanoscale dimensions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In studying solidification process by simulations on the atomic scale, the
modeling of crystal nucleation or amorphisation requires the construction of
interatomic interactions that are able to reproduce the properties of both the
solid and the liquid states. Taking into account rare nucleation events or
structural relaxation under deep undercooling conditions requires much larger
length scales and longer time scales than those achievable by \textit{ab
initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD). This problem is addressed by means of
classical MD simulations using a well established high dimensional neural
network potential trained on a relevant set of configurations generated by
AIMD. Our dataset contains various crystalline structures and liquid states at
different pressures, including their time fluctuations in a wide range of
temperatures considering only their energy labels. Applied to elemental
aluminium, the resulting potential is shown to be efficient to reproduce the
basic structural, dynamics and thermodynamic quantities in the liquid and
undercooled states without the need to include neither explicitly the forces
nor all kind of configurations in the training procedure. The early stage of
crystallization is further investigated on a much larger scale with one million
atoms, allowing us to unravel features of the homogeneous nucleation mechanisms
in the fcc phase at ambient pressure as well as in the bcc phase at high
pressure with unprecedented accuracy close to the \textit{ab initio} one. In
both case, a single step nucleation process is observed.</p>

    <p>The heavy-fermion system $\mathrm{UTe_2}$ is a candidate for spin-triplet superconductivity, which is of considerable interest to quantum engineering. Among the outstanding issues is the nature of the pairing state. A recent surprising discovery is the observation of a resonance in the spin excitation spectrum at an antiferromagnetic wavevector [C. Duan {\it et al.}, Nature \textbf{600}, 636 (2021)], which stands in apparent contrast to the ferromagnetic nature of the interactions expected in this system. We show how the puzzle can be resolved by a multiorbital spin-triplet pairing constructed from local degrees of freedom. Because it does not commute with the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian, the pairing contains both intra- and inter-band terms in the band basis. We demonstrate that the intraband pairing component naturally yields a spin resonance at the antiferromagnetic wavevector. Our work illustrates how orbital degrees of freedom can enrich the nature and properties of spin-triplet superconductivity of strongly-correlated quantum materials.</p>

    <p>Harmonic analysis is a powerful tool to characterize and quantify current-induced torques acting on magnetic materials, but so far it remains an open question in studying antiferromagnets. Here we formulate a general theory of harmonic Hall responses of collinear antiferromagnets driven by current-induced torques including both field-like and damping-like components. By scanning a magnetic field of variable strength in three orthogonal planes, we are able to distinguish the contributions from field-like torque, damping-like torque, and concomitant thermal effects by analyzing the second harmonic signals in the Hall voltage. The analytical expressions of the first and second harmonics as functions of the magnetic field direction and strength are confirmed by numerical simulations with good agreement. We demonstrate our predictions in two prototype antiferromagnets, $Œ±-$Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and NiO, providing direct and general guidance to current and future experiments.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Clapping modes, which are relative amplitude and phase modes between two chiral components of Cooper pairs, are bosonic collective modes inherent to chiral superconductors. These modes behave as long-lived bosons with masses smaller than the threshold energy, $2|Œî|$, for decay into unbound fermion pairs. Here, we clarify that the real/imaginary clapping modes in chiral superconductors directly couple to acoustic wave propagation when the weak particle-hole asymmetry of the normal state quasiparticle dispersion is taken into account. The clapping modes driven by an acoustic wave generate an alternating electric current, that is, the acoustoelectric effect in superconductors. Significantly, the clapping modes give rise to a transverse electric current. When the sound velocity is comparable to the Fermi velocity, as in heavy fermion compounds, the transverse current is resonantly enhanced at energy below the threshold for continuum excitations. This resonance provides a smoking-gun evidence of chiral superconductivity.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Graphene is well known for its extraordinary mechanical properties combining
brittleness and ductility. While most mechanical studies of graphene focused on
the strength and brittle fracture behavior, its ductility, plastic deformation,
and the possible brittle-to-ductile transition, which are important for
high-temperature mechanical performance and applications, still remain much
less understood. Here the mechanical response and deformation dynamics of
graphene grain boundaries are investigated through a phase field crystal
modeling, showing the pivotal effects of temperature and local dislocation
structure. Our results indicate that even at relatively high temperature
(around 3350 K), the system is still governed by a brittle fracture and
cracking dynamics as found in previous low-temperature experimental and
atomistic studies. We also identify another type of failure dynamics with
low-angle grain boundary disintegration. When temperature increases a
transition to plastic deformation is predicted. The appearance of plastic flow
at ultrahigh temperature, particularly the phenomenon of jerky plasticity, is
attributed to the stick and climb-glide motion of dislocations around the grain
boundary. The corresponding mechanism is intrinsic to two-dimensional systems,
and governed by the competition between the driving force of accumulated local
stress and the defect pinning effect, without the traditional pathways of
dislocation generation needed in three-dimensional materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The dynamical mechanisms underlying the grain evolution and growth are of
fundamental importance in controlling the structural properties of large-scale
polycrystalline materials, but the effects of lattice ordering and distinct
atomic species in multi-component material systems are still not well
understood. We study these effects through the phase field crystal modeling of
embedded curved grains in two-dimensional hexagonal materials, by examining and
comparing the results of grain rotation, shrinking, and grain boundary dynamics
over the full range of misorientation in binary systems of hexagonal boron
nitride and single-component graphene monolayers. Calculations of the relation
between grain radius and misorientation angle during time evolution reveal the
normal-tangential coupled motion of the grain boundary matching the Cahn-Taylor
formulation, as well as the transition to sliding and the regime of grain
motion without rotation. The key effect of two-component sublattice ordering is
identified, showing as a dual behavior of both positive and negative coupling
modes with grains rotating towards increasing and decreasing angles, which is
absent in two-dimensional single-component systems. The corresponding
mechanisms are beyond the purely geometric considerations and require the
energetic contribution from the difference between heteroelemental and
homoelemental atomic bondings and the subsequent availability of a diverse
variety of defect core structures and transformations. This indicates the
important role played by the lattice inversion symmetry breaking in binary or
multi-component materials, causing the change of detailed microstructures and
dynamics of dislocation defects at grain boundaries as compared to
single-component materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Little is known about the role of weak interlayer coupling in the second harmonic generation (SHG) effects of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) systems. In this article, taking homo-bilayer $MoS_2/MoS_2$ and hetero-bilayer $MoS_2/MoSe_2$ as typical examples, we have systemically investigated their SHG susceptibilities as a function of interlayer hopping strength using first-principles calculations. For the SHG at zero frequency limit of both $MoS_2/MoS_2$ and $MoS_2/MoSe_2$, although the increase of tint can increase the intensities of interlayer optical transitions (IOT), the increased band repulsion around G point can eventually decrease their SHG values; the larger the tint, the smaller the SHG response. For the SHG spectra of $MoS_2/MoSe_2$ in the low photon-energy region, opposite to the $MoS_2/MoS_2$, their peak values are very sensitive to the variable tint, due to the strong $t_{int}$-dependent IOT dominating in the band edge; the larger the tint, the larger the SHG. For the SHG of $MoS_2/MoS_2$ in the high photon-energy region, comparing to the $MoS_2/MoSe_2$, their peak values will decrease in a much more noticeable way as the $t_{int}$ increases, due to the larger reduction of band nesting effect. Our study not only can successfully explain the puzzling experimental observations for the different SHG responses in different bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides under variable tint, but also may provide a general understanding for designing controllable the SHG effects in the vdW systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The presence of electrostatic forces and associated artifacts complicates the interpretation of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM). Eliminating these artifacts provides an opportunity for precisely mapping domain wall structures and dynamics, accurately quantifying local piezoelectric coupling coefficients, and reliably investigating hysteretic processes at the single nanometer scale to determine properties and mechanisms which underly important applications including computing, batteries and biology. Here we exploit the existence of an electrostatic blind spot (ESBS) along the length of the cantilever, due to the distributed nature of the electrostatic force, which can be universally used to separate unwanted long range electrostatic contributions from short range electromechanical responses of interest. The results of ESBS-PFM are compared to state-of-the-art interferometric displacement sensing PFM, showing excellent agreement above their respective noise floors. Ultimately, ESBS-PFM allows for absolute quantification of piezoelectric coupling coefficients independent of probe, lab or experimental conditions. As such, we expect the widespread adoption of EBSB-PFM to be a paradigm shift in the quantification of nanoscale electromechanics.</p>

    <p>Deep learning based generative models such as deepfake have been able to
generate amazing images and videos. However, these models may need significant
transformation when applied to generate crystal materials structures in which
the building blocks, the physical atoms are very different from the pixels.

    <p>We report a novel multi-scale simulation methodology to quantitatively
predict the thermodynamic behaviour of polymer mixtures, that exhibit phases
with broken orientational symmetry. Our system consists of a binary mixture of
oligomers and rod-like mesogens. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD)
simulations we infer the topology of the temperature-dependent free energy
landscape from the probability distributions of excess volume fraction of the
components. The mixture exhibits nematic and smectic phases as a function of
two temperature scales, the nematic-isotropic temperature $T_{NI}$ and the
$T_c$, the transition that governs the polymer demixing. Using a mean-field
free energy of polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs), with suitably chosen
parameter values, we construct a mean-field phase diagram that
semi-quantitatively match those obtained from CGMD simulations. Our results are
applicable to mixtures of synthetic and biological macromolecules that undergo
phase separation and are orientable, thereby giving rise to the liquid

    <p>Magnetic materials are crucial components of many technologies that could
drive the ecological transition, including electric motors, wind turbine
generators and magnetic refrigeration systems. Discovering materials with large
magnetic moments is therefore an increasing priority. Here, using
state-of-the-art machine learning methods, we scan the Inorganic Crystal
Structure Database (ICSD) of hundreds of thousands of existing materials to
find those that are ferromagnetic and have large magnetic moments. Crystal
graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), materials graph network (MEGNet)
and random forests are trained on the Materials Project database that contains
the results of high-throughput DFT predictions. For random forests, we use a
stochastic method to select nearly one hundred relevant descriptors based on
chemical composition and crystal structure. This gives results that are
comparable to those of neural networks. The comparison between these different
machine learning approaches gives an estimate of the errors for our predictions
on the ICSD database. Validating our final predictions by comparisons with
available experimental data, we found 15 materials that are likely to have
large magnetic moments and have not been yet studied experimentally.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Fast and accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms and web
servers are highly desirable for exploring and discovering new materials out of
the infinite design space. However, currently, the computationally expensive
first principle calculation based crystal structure prediction algorithms are
applicable to relatively small systems and are out of reach of most materials
researchers due to the requirement of high computing resources or the software
cost related to ab initio code such as VASP. Several computational teams have
used an element substitution approach for generating or predicting new
structures, but usually in an ad hoc way. Here we develop a template based
crystal structure prediction algorithm (TCSP) and its companion web server,
which makes this tool to be accessible to all materials researchers. Our
algorithm uses elemental/chemical similarity and oxidation states to guide the
selection of template structures and then rank them based on the substitution
compatibility and can return multiple predictions with ranking scores in a few
minutes. Benchmark study on the ~98,290 formulas of the Materials Project
database using leave-one-out evaluation shows that our algorithm can achieve
high accuracy (for 13,145 target structures, TCSP predicted their structures
with RMSD < 0.1) for a large portion of the formulas. We have also used TCSP to
discover new materials of the Ga-B-N system showing its potential for
high-throughput materials discovery. Our user-friendly web app TCSP can be

    <p>Degenerate points/lines in the bulk band structures of crystals have become a
staple of the growing number of topological materials. The bulk-boundary
correspondence provides a relation between bulk topology and surface states.
While line degeneracies of bulk excitations have been extensively
characterized, line degeneracies of surface states are not well understood. We
show that SnIP, a quasi-one-dimensional van der Waals material with a double
helix crystal structure, exhibits topological nodal rings/lines in both the
bulk phonon modes and their corresponding surface states. Using a combination
of first-principles calculations, symmetry-based indicator theories and Zak
phase analysis, we find that two neighbouring bulk nodal rings form doubly
degenerate lines in their drumhead-like surface states, which are protected by
the combination of time-reversal and glide mirror symmetries
$\mathcal{T}\bar{M}_y$. Our results indicate that surface degeneracies can be
generically protected by symmetries such as $\mathcal{T}\bar{M}_y$, and phonons
provide an ideal platform to explore such degeneracies.</p>

    <p>In three-dimensional (3D) crystals, emergent particles arise when two or
multiple bands contact and form degeneracy (band crossing) in the Brillouin
zone. Recently a complete classification of emergent particles in 3D
nonmagnetic crystals, which described by the type-II magnetic space groups
(MSGs), has been established. However, a systematic investigation of emergent
particles in magnetic crystals has not yet been performed, due to the
complexity of the symmetries of magnetically ordered structures. Here, we
address this challenging task by exploring the possibilities of the emergent
particles in the 674 type-III MSGs. Based on effective k.p Hamiltonian and our
classification of emergent particles [Yu et al., Sci. Bull. 67, 375 (2022)
DOI:10.1016/j.scib.2021.10.023], we identify all possible emergent particles,
including spinful and spinless, essential and accidental particles in the
type-III MSGs. We find that all emergent particles in type-III MSGs also exist
in type-II MSGs, with only one exception, i.e. the combined quadratic nodal
line and nodal surface (QNL/NS). Moreover, tabulations of the emergent
particles in each of the 674 type-III MSGs, together with the symmetry
operations, the small corepresentations, the effective k.p Hamiltonians, and
the topological character of these particles, are explicitly presented.
Remarkably, combining this work and our homemade SpaceGroupIrep and MSGCorep
packages will provide an effcient way to search topological magnetic materials
with novel quasiparticles.</p>

    <p>Taking advantage of the advances in generative deep learning, particularly
normalizing flow, a framework, called Boltzmann Generator, has recently been

the canonical ensemble and determining the associated free energy. In this
work, we revisit Boltzmann Generator to motivate the construction of the loss
function from the statistical mechanical point of view, and to cast the
training of the neural networks in a purely unsupervised manner that requires
no samples of the atomic configurations from the equilibrium ensemble. We
further show that the normalizing flow framework furnishes a reference
thermodynamic system, very close to the real thermodynamic system under
consideration, that is suitable for the well-established free energy
perturbation methods to determine accurate free energy of solids. We then apply
the normalizing flow to two problems: temperature-dependent Gibbs free energy
of perfect crystal and formation free energy of monovacancy defect in a model
system of diamond cubic Si. The results obtained from the normalizing flow are
shown to be in good agreement with that obtained from independent
well-established free energy methods.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Phase-field models of microstructural pattern formation during alloy
solidification are commonly solved numerically using the finite-difference
method, which is ideally suited to carry out computationally efficient
simulations on massively parallel computer architectures such as Graphic
Processing Units. However, one known drawback of this method is that the
discretization of differential terms involving spatial derivatives introduces a
spurious lattice anisotropy that can influence the solid-liquid interface
dynamics. We find that this influence is significant for the case of
polycrystalline dendritic solidification, where the crystal axes of different
grains do not generally coincide with the reference axes of the
finite-difference lattice. In particular, we find that with the commonly used
finite-difference implementation of the quantitative phase-field model of
binary alloy solidification, both the operating state of the dendrite tip and
the dendrite growth orientation are strongly affected by the lattice
anisotropy. To circumvent this problem, we use known methods in both real and
Fourier space to derive finite-difference approximations of leading
differential terms in 2D and 3D that are isotropic at order $h^2$ of the
lattice spacing $h$. Importantly, those terms include the divergence of the
anti-trapping current that is found to have a critical influence on pattern
selection. The 2D and 3D discretizations use an approximated form of the
anti-trapping current that facilitates the Fourier-space derivation of the
associated isotropic differential operator at $O(h^2)$, but we also derive a 2D
discretization of the standard form of this current. Finally, we present 2D and
3D phase-field simulations of alloy solidification, showing that the isotropic
finite-difference implementations can dramatically reduce spurious lattice
anisotropy effects.</p>

    <p>Deep learning techniques have been increasingly applied to the natural
sciences, e.g., for property prediction and optimization or material discovery.
A fundamental ingredient of such approaches is the vast quantity of labelled
data needed to train the model; this poses severe challenges in data-scarce
settings where obtaining labels requires substantial computational or labor
resources. Here, we introduce surrogate- and invariance-boosted contrastive
learning (SIB-CL), a deep learning framework which incorporates three
``inexpensive'' and easily obtainable auxiliary information sources to overcome
data scarcity. Specifically, these are: 1)~abundant unlabeled data, 2)~prior
knowledge of symmetries or invariances and 3)~surrogate data obtained at
near-zero cost. We demonstrate SIB-CL's effectiveness and generality on various
scientific problems, e.g., predicting the density-of-states of 2D photonic
crystals and solving the 3D time-independent Schrodinger equation. SIB-CL
consistently results in orders of magnitude reduction in the number of labels
needed to achieve the same network accuracies.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing
challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because
stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible
periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy
minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the
structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between
different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and
often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational
Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material
stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the
decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic
coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy
bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes
interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation,
rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in
three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid,
diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a
specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation
metrics for the broader machine learning community.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal structure prediction has been a subject of topical interest, but
remains a substantial challenge, especially for complex structures as it deals
with the global minimization of the extremely rugged high-dimensional potential
energy surface. In this manuscript, a symmetry-orientated divide-and-conquer
scheme was proposed to construct a symmetry tree graph, where the entire search
space is decomposed into a finite number of symmetry-dependent subspaces. An
artificial intelligence-based symmetry selection strategy was subsequently
devised to select the low-lying subspaces with high symmetries for global
exploration and in-depth exploitation. Our approach can significantly simplify
the problem of crystal structure prediction by avoiding exploration of the most
complex P1 subspace on the entire search space and have the advantage of
preserving the crystal symmetry during structure evolution, making it well
suitable for predicting the complex crystal structures. The effectiveness of
the method has been validated by successful prediction of the candidate
structures of binary Lennard-Jones mixtures and high-pressure phase of ice,
containing more than one hundred atoms in the simulation cell. The work,
therefore, opens up an opportunity towards achieving the long-sought goal for
crystal structure prediction of complex systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) based materials discovery has emerged as one of the
most promising approaches for breakthroughs in materials science. While
heuristic knowledge based descriptors have been combined with ML algorithms to
achieve good performance, the complexity of the physicochemical mechanisms
makes it urgently needed to exploit representation learning from either
compositions or structures for building highly effective materials machine
learning models. Among these methods, the graph neural networks have shown the
best performance by its capability to learn high-level features from crystal
structures. However, all these models suffer from their inability to scale up
the models due to the over-smoothing issue of their message-passing GNN
architecture. Here we propose a novel graph attention neural network model
DeeperGATGNN with differentiable group normalization and skip-connections,
which allows to train very deep graph neural network models (e.g. 30 layers
compared to 3-9 layers in previous works). Through systematic benchmark studies
over six benchmark datasets for energy and band gap predictions, we show that
our scalable DeeperGATGNN model needs little costly hyper-parameter tuning for
different datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performances
over five properties out of six with up to 10\% improvement. Our work shows
that to deal with the high complexity of mapping the crystal materials
structures to their properties, large-scale very deep graph neural networks are
needed to achieve robust performances.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This work develops a new open source API and software package called
\textit{SymPhas} for simulations of phase-field, phase-field crystal and
reaction-diffusion models, supporting up to three dimensions and an arbitrary
number of fields. \textit{SymPhas} delivers two novel program capabilities: 1)
User specification of models from the associated dynamical equations in an
unconstrained form and 2) extensive support for integrating user-developed
discrete-grid-based numerical solvers into the API. The capability to specify
general phase-field models is primarily achieved by developing a novel symbolic
algebra functionality that can formulate mathematical expressions at compile
time, is able to apply rules of symbolic algebra such as distribution,
factoring and automatic simplification, and support user-driven expression tree
manipulation. A modular design based on the CC++ template meta-programming
paradigm is applied to the symbolic algebra library and general API
implementation to minimize application runtime and increase the accessibility
of the API for third party development. \textit{SymPhas} is written in C/CC++
and emphasizes high-performance capabilities via parallelization with OpenMP
and the CC++ standard library. \textit{SymPhas} is equipped with a forward
Euler solver and a semi-implicit Fourier spectral solver. Sample
implementations and simulations of several phase-field models are presented,
generated using the semi-implicit Fourier spectral solver.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal-structure phase mapping is a core, long-standing challenge in
materials science that requires identifying crystal structures, or mixtures
thereof, in synthesized materials. Materials science experts excel at solving
simple systems but cannot solve complex systems, creating a major bottleneck in
high-throughput materials discovery. Herein we show how to automate
crystal-structure phase mapping. We formulate phase mapping as an unsupervised
pattern demixing problem and describe how to solve it using Deep Reasoning
Networks (DRNets). DRNets combine deep learning with constraint reasoning for
incorporating scientific prior knowledge and consequently require only a modest
amount of (unlabeled) data. DRNets compensate for the limited data by
exploiting and magnifying the rich prior knowledge about the thermodynamic
rules governing the mixtures of crystals with constraint reasoning seamlessly
integrated into neural network optimization. DRNets are designed with an
interpretable latent space for encoding prior-knowledge domain constraints and
seamlessly integrate constraint reasoning into neural network optimization.
DRNets surpass previous approaches on crystal-structure phase mapping,
unraveling the Bi-Cu-V oxide phase diagram, and aiding the discovery of
solar-fuels materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of new multicomponent inorganic compounds can provide direct
solutions to many scientific and engineering challenges, yet the vast size of
the uncharted material space dwarfs current synthesis throughput. While the
computational crystal structure prediction is expected to mitigate this
frustration, the NP-hardness and steep costs of density functional theory (DFT)
calculations prohibit material exploration at scale. Herein, we introduce
SPINNER, a highly efficient and reliable structure-prediction framework based
on exhaustive random searches and evolutionary algorithms, which is completely
free from empiricism. Empowered by accurate neural network potentials, the
program can navigate the configuration space faster than DFT by more than
10$^{2}$-fold. In blind tests on 60 ternary compositions diversely selected
from the experimental database, SPINNER successfully identifies experimental
(or theoretically more stable) phases for ~80% of materials within 5000
generations, entailing up to half a million structure evaluations for each
composition. When benchmarked against previous data mining or DFT-based
evolutionary predictions, SPINNER identifies more stable phases in the majority
of cases. By developing a reliable and fast structure-prediction framework,
this work opens the door to large-scale, unbounded computational exploration of
undiscovered inorganic crystals.</p>

    <p>A routine crystallography technique, crystal structure analysis, is rarely

we develop an algorithm that analyzes point group symmetry directly from
particle coordinates. The algorithm operates on functions defined on the
surface of the sphere, such as the bond orientational order diagram. Other use
cases are the orientation of crystals and adoption as generalized order
parameters for detecting the appearance of order as well as following its

    <p>A method based on the Fast Fourier Transform is proposed to obtain the
dispersion relation of acoustic waves in heterogeneous periodic media with
arbitrary microstructures. The microstructure is explicitly considered using a
voxelized Representative Volume Element (RVE). The dispersion diagram is
obtained solving an eigenvalue problem for Bloch waves in Fourier space. To
this aim, two linear operators representing stiffness and mass are defined
through the use of differential operators in Fourier space. The smallest
eigenvalues are obtained using the implicitly restarted Lanczos and the
subspace iteration methods, and the required inverse of the stiffness operator
is done using the conjugate gradient with a preconditioner. The method is used
to study the propagation of acoustic waves in elastic polycrystals, showing the
strong effect of crystal anistropy and polycrystaline texture on the
propagation. It is shown that the method combines the simplicity of classical
Fourier series analysis with the versatility of Finite Elements to account for
complex geometries proving an efficient and general approach which allows the
use of large RVEs in 3D.</p>

    <p>A fundamental challenge in materials science pertains to elucidating the
relationship between stoichiometry, stability, structure, and property. Recent
advances have shown that machine learning can be used to learn such
relationships, allowing the stability and functional properties of materials to
be accurately predicted. However, most of these approaches use atomic
coordinates as input and are thus bottle-necked by crystal structure
identification when investigating novel materials. Our approach solves this
bottleneck by coarse-graining the infinite search space of atomic coordinates
into a combinatorially enumerable search space. The key idea is to use Wyckoff
representations -- coordinate-free sets of symmetry-related positions in a
crystal -- as the input to a machine learning model. Our model demonstrates
exceptionally high precision in discovering new theoretically stable materials,
identifying 1,569 materials that lie below the known convex hull of previously
calculated materials from just 5,675 ab-initio calculations. Our approach opens
up fundamental advances in computational materials discovery.</p>

    <p>Machine-learning force fields (MLFF) should be accurate, computationally and
data efficient, and applicable to molecules, materials, and interfaces thereof.
Currently, MLFFs often introduce tradeoffs that restrict their practical
applicability to small subsets of chemical space or require exhaustive datasets
for training. Here, we introduce the Bravais-Inspired Gradient-Domain Machine
Learning (BIGDML) approach and demonstrate its ability to construct reliable
force fields using a training set with just 10-200 geometries for materials
including pristine and defect-containing 2D and 3D semiconductors and metals,
as well as chemisorbed and physisorbed atomic and molecular adsorbates on
surfaces. The BIGDML model employs the full relevant symmetry group for a given
material, does not assume artificial atom types or localization of atomic
interactions and exhibits high data efficiency and state-of-the-art energy
accuracies (errors substantially below 1 meV per atom) for an extended set of
materials. Extensive path-integral molecular dynamics carried out with BIGDML
models demonstrate the counterintuitive localization of benzene--graphene
dynamics induced by nuclear quantum effects and allow to rationalize the
Arrhenius behavior of hydrogen diffusion coefficient in a Pd crystal for a wide
range of temperatures.</p>

    <p>MAELAS is a computer program for the calculation of magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy, anisotropic magnetostrictive coefficients and magnetoelastic
constants in an automated way. The method originally implemented in version 1.0
of MAELAS was based on the length optimization of the unit cell, proposed by Wu
and Freeman, to calculate the anisotropic magnetostrictive coefficients. We
present here a revised and updated version (v2.0) of MAELAS, where we added a
new methodology to compute anisotropic magnetoelastic constants from a linear
fitting of the energy versus applied strain. We analyze and compare the
accuracy of both methods showing that the new approach is more reliable and
robust than the one implemented in version 1.0, especially for non-cubic
crystal symmetries. This analysis also help us to find that the accuracy of the
method implemented in version 1.0 could be improved by using deformation
gradients derived from the equilibrium magnetoelastic strain tensor, as well as
potential future alternative methods like the strain optimization method.
Additionally, we clarify the role of the demagnetized state in the fractional
change in length, and derive the expression for saturation magnetostriction for
polycrystals with trigonal, tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. In
this new version, we also fix some issues related to trigonal crystal symmetry
found in version 1.0.</p>

    <p>Compositional disorder induces myriad captivating phenomena in perovskites.
Target-driven discovery of perovskite solid solutions has been a great
challenge due to the analytical complexity introduced by disorder. Here, we
demonstrate that an unsupervised deep learning strategy can find fingerprints
of disordered materials that embed perovskite formability and underlying
crystal structure information by learning only from the chemical composition,
manifested in (A1-xA'x)BO3 and A(B1-xB'x)O3 formulae. This phenomenon can be
capitalized to predict the crystal symmetry of experimental compositions,
outperforming several supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. The educated
nature of material fingerprints has led to the conception of analogical
materials discovery that facilitates inverse exploration of promising
perovskites based on similarity investigation with known materials. The search
space of unstudied perovskites is screened from ~600,000 feasible compounds
using experimental data powered ML models and automated web mining tools at a
94% success rate. This concept further provides insights on possible phase
transitions and computational modelling of complex compositions. The proposed
quantitative analysis of materials analogies is expected to bridge the gap
between the existing materials literature and the undiscovered terrain.</p>

    <p>Among the transparent conducting oxides, the perovskite barium stannate is
most promising for various electronic applications due to its outstanding
carrier mobility achieved at room temperature. However, most of its important
characteristics, such as band gaps, effective masses, and absorption edge,
remain controversial. Here, we provide a fully consistent picture by combining
state-of-the-art {\it ab initio} methodology with forefront electron
energy-loss spectroscopy and optical absorption measurements. Valence electron
energy-loss spectra, featuring signals originating from band gap transitions,
are acquired on defect-free sample regions of a BaSnO$_{3}$ single crystal.
These high-energy-resolution measurements are able to capture also very weak
excitations below the optical gap, attributed to indirect transitions. By
temperature-dependent optical absorption measurements, we assess band-gap
renormalization effects induced by electron-phonon coupling. Overall, we find
for the effective electronic mass, the direct and the indirect gap, the optical
gap, as well as the absorption onsets and spectra, excellent agreement between
both experimental techniques and the theoretical many-body results, supporting
also the picture of a phonon-mediated mechanism where indirect transitions are
activated by phonon-induced symmetry lowering. This work demonstrates a
fruitful connection between different high-level theoretical and experimental
methods for exploring the characteristics of advanced materials.</p>

    <p>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular paradigm for global optimization of
expensive black-box functions, but there are many domains where the function is
not completely a black-box. The data may have some known structure (e.g.
symmetries) and/or the data generation process may be a composite process that
yields useful intermediate or auxiliary information in addition to the value of
the optimization objective. However, surrogate models traditionally employed in
BO, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), scale poorly with dataset size and do not
easily accommodate known structure. Instead, we use Bayesian neural networks, a
class of scalable and flexible surrogate models with inductive biases, to
extend BO to complex, structured problems with high dimensionality. We
demonstrate BO on a number of realistic problems in physics and chemistry,
including topology optimization of photonic crystal materials using
convolutional neural networks, and chemical property optimization of molecules
using graph neural networks. On these complex tasks, we show that neural
networks often outperform GPs as surrogate models for BO in terms of both
sampling efficiency and computational cost.</p>

    <p>Raman spectroscopy is an advantageous method for studying the local structure
of materials, but the interpretation of measured spectra is complicated by the
presence of oblique phonons in polycrystals of polar materials. Whilst group
theory considerations and standard ab initio calculations are helpful, they are
often valid only for single crystals. In this paper, we introduce a method for
computing Raman spectra of polycrystalline materials from first principles. We
start from the standard approach based on the (Placzek) rotation invariants of
the Raman tensors and extend it to include the effect of the coupling between
the lattice vibrations and the induced electric field, and the electro-optic
contribution, relevant for polar materials like ferroelectrics. As exemplified
by applying the method to rhombohedral BaTiO3, AlN, and LiNbO3, such an
extension brings the simulated Raman spectrum to a much better correspondence
with the experimental one. Additional advantages of the method are that it is
general, permits automation, and thus can be used in high-throughput fashion.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials informatics has emerged as a promisingly new paradigm for
accelerating materials discovery and design. It exploits the intelligent power
of machine learning methods in massive materials data from experiments or
simulations to seek for new materials, functionality, principles, etc.
Developing specialized facility to generate, collect, manage, learn and mine
large-scale materials data is crucial to materials informatics. We herein
developed an artificial-intelligence-aided data-driven infrastructure named
Jilin Artificial-intelligence aided Materials-design Integrated Package
(JAMIP), which is an open-source Python framework to meet the research
requirements of computational materials informatics. It is integrated by
materials production factory, high-throughput first-principles calculations
engine, automatic tasks submission and monitoring progress, data extraction,
management and storage system, and artificial intelligence machine learning
based data mining functions. We have integrated specific features such as
inorganic crystal structure prototype database to facilitate high-throughput
calculations and essential modules associated with machine learning studies of
functional materials. We demonstrated how our developed code is useful in
exploring materials informatics of optoelectronic semiconductors by taking
halide perovskites as typical case. By obeying the principles of automation,
extensibility, reliability and intelligence, the JAMIP code is a promisingly
powerful tool contributing to the fast-growing field of computational materials
informatics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Atom-in-jellium calculations of the electron states, and perturbative
calculations of the Einstein frequency, were used to construct equations of
state (EOS) from around $10^{-5}$ to $10^7$g/cm$^3$ and $10^{-4}$ to $10^{6}$eV
for elements relevant to white dwarf (WD) stars. This is the widest range
reported for self-consistent electronic shell structure calculations. Elements
of the same ratio of atomic weight to atomic number were predicted to asymptote
to the same $T=0$ isotherm, suggesting that, contrary to recent studies of the
crystallization of WDs, the amount of gravitational energy that could be
released by separation of oxygen and carbon is small. A generalized Lindemann
criterion based on the amplitude of the ion-thermal oscillations calculated
using atom-in-jellium theory, previously used to extrapolate melt curves for
metals, was found to reproduce previous thermodynamic studies of the melt curve
of the one component plasma with a choice of vibration amplitude consistent
with low pressure results. For elements for which low pressure melting
satisfies the same amplitude criterion, such as Al, this melt model thus gives
a likely estimate of the melt curve over the full range of normal electronic
matter; for the other elements, it provides a useful constraint on the melt
locus.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>One of the most important aims of grain boundary modeling is to predict the
evolution of a large collection of grains in phenomena such as abnormal grain
growth, coupled grain boundary motion, and recrystallization that occur under
extreme thermomechanical loads. A unified framework to study the coevolution of
grain boundaries with bulk plasticity has recently been developed by Admal et
al. (2018), which is based on modeling grain boundaries as continuum
dislocations governed by an energy based on the Kobayashi--Warren--Carter (KWC)
model (Kobayashi et al., 1998, 2000). While the resulting unified model
demonstrates coupled grain boundary motion and polygonization (seen in
recrystallization), it is restricted to grain boundary energies of the
Read--Shockley type, which applies only to small misorientation angles. In
addition, the implementation of the unified model using finite elements
inherits the computational challenges of the KWC model that originate from the
singular diffusive nature of its governing equations. The main goal of this
study is to generalize the KWC functional to grain boundary energies beyond the
Read--Shockley-type that respect the bicrystallography of grain boundaries. The
computational challenges of the KWC model are addressed by developing a
thresholding method that relies on a primal dual algorithm and the fast
marching method, resulting in an O(NlogN) algorithm, where N is the number of
grid points. We validate the model by demonstrating the Herring angle relation,
followed by a study of the grain microstructure evolution in a two-dimensional
face-centered cubic copper polycrystal with crystal symmetry-invariant grain
boundary energy data obtained from the lattice matching method of Runnels et
al. (2016a,b).</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Significant progress in many classes of materials could be made with the
availability of experimentally-derived large datasets composed of atomic
identities and three-dimensional coordinates. Methods for visualizing the local
atomic structure, such as atom probe tomography (APT), which routinely generate
datasets comprised of millions of atoms, are an important step in realizing
this goal. However, state-of-the-art APT instruments generate noisy and sparse
datasets that provide information about elemental type, but obscure atomic
structures, thus limiting their subsequent value for materials discovery. The
application of a materials fingerprinting process, a machine learning algorithm
coupled with topological data analysis, provides an avenue by which
here-to-fore unprecedented structural information can be extracted from an APT
dataset. As a proof of concept, the material fingerprint is applied to
high-entropy alloy APT datasets containing body-centered cubic (BCC) and
face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structures. A local atomic configuration
centered on an arbitrary atom is assigned a topological descriptor, with which
it can be characterized as a BCC or FCC lattice with near perfect accuracy,
despite the inherent noise in the dataset. This successful identification of a
fingerprint is a crucial first step in the development of algorithms which can
extract more nuanced information, such as chemical ordering, from existing
datasets of complex materials.</p>

    <p>In computational material design, ionic radius is one of the most important
physical parameters used to predict material properties. Motivated by the
progress in computational materials science and material informatics, we extend
the renowned Shannon's table from 475 ions to 987 ions. Accordingly, a rigorous
Machine Learning (ML) approach is employed to extend the ionic radii table
using all possible combinations of Oxidation States (OS) and Coordination
Numbers (CN) available in crystallographic repositories. An ionic-radius
regression model for Shannon's database is developed as a function of the
period number, the valence orbital configuration, OS, CN, and Ionization
Potential. In the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model, the reached R-square
$R^2$ accuracy is 99\% while the root mean square error of radii is 0.0332 \AA.
The optimized GPR model is then employed for predicting a new set of ionic
radii for uncommon combinations of OS and CN extracted by harnessing crystal
structures from materials project databases. The generated data is consolidated
with the reputable Shannon's data and is made available online in a database
repository \url{https://cmd-ml.github.io/}.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recently acoustic signature of dislocation avalanches in HCP materials was
found to be long tailed in size and energy, suggesting critical dynamics. Even
more recently, the intermittent plastic response was found to be generic for
micro- and nano-sized systems independently of their crystallographic symmetry.
These rather remarkable discoveries are reviewed in this paper in the
perspective of the recent studies performed in our group. We discuss the
physical origin and the scaling properties of plastic fluctuations and address
the nature of their dependence on crystalline symmetry, system size, and
disorder content. A particular emphasis is placed on the associated emergent
behaviors, including the formation of dislocation structures, and on our
ability to temper plastic fluctuations by alloying. We also discuss the
"smaller is wilder" size effect that culminates in a paradoxical crack-free
brittle behavior of very small, initially dislocation free crystals. We show
that the implied transition between different rheological behaviors is
regulated by the ratio of length scales $R=L/l$, where $L$ is the system size
and $l$ is the internal length. We link this new size effect with other related
phenomena like size dependence of strength ("smaller is stronger") and the size
induced switch between different hardening mechanisms. One of the technological
challenges in nanoscience is to tame the intermittency of plastic flow. We show
that this task can be accomplished by generating tailored quenched disorder
which allows one to control micro- and nano-scale forming and opens new
perspectives in micro-metallurgy and structural engineering of ultra-small
load-carrying elements. These results could not be achieved by conventional
methods that do not explicitly consider the stochastic nature of collective
dislocation dynamics.</p>

    <p>Two dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising functional materials
with many applications such as semiconductors and photovoltaics because of
their unique optoelectronic properties. While several thousand 2D materials
have been screened in existing materials databases, discovering new 2D

generative model for composition generation combined with random forest based
2D materials classifier to discover new hypothetical 2D materials. Furthermore,
a template based element substitution structure prediction approach is
developed to predict the crystal structures of a subset of the newly predicted
hypothetical formulas, which allows us to confirm their structure stability
using DFT calculations. So far, we have discovered 267,489 new potential 2D
materials compositions and confirmed twelve 2D/layered materials by DFT
formation energy calculation. Our results show that generative machine learning
models provide an effective way to explore the vast chemical design space for
new 2D materials discovery.</p>

    <p>The MechElastic Python package evaluates the mechanical and elastic
properties of bulk and 2D materials using the elastic coefficient matrix
($C_{ij}$) obtained from any ab-initio density-functional theory (DFT) code.
The current version of this package reads the output of VASP, ABINIT, and
Quantum Espresso codes (but it can be easily generalized to any other DFT code)
and performs the appropriate post-processing of elastic constants as per the
requirement of the user. This program can also detect the input structure's
crystal symmetry and test the mechanical stability of all crystal classes using
the Born-Huang criteria. Various useful material-specific properties such as
elastic moduli, longitudinal and transverse elastic wave velocities, Debye
temperature, elastic anisotropy, 2D layer modulus, hardness, Pugh's ratio,
Cauchy's pressure, Kleinman parameter, and Lame's coefficients, can be
estimated using this program. Another existing feature of this program is to
employ the ELATE package [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28, 275201 (2016)] and plot
the spatial variation of several elastic properties such as Poisson's ratio,
linear compressibility, shear modulus, and Young's modulus in three dimensions.
Further, the MechElastic package can plot the equation of state (EOS) curves
for energy and pressure for a variety of EOS models such as Murnaghan, Birch,
Birch-Murnaghan, and Vinet, by reading the inputted energy/pressure versus
volume data obtained via numerical calculations or experiments. This package is

allows them to accurately simulate relaxations of both ionic positions and
lattice vectors. We show that models trained on the molecular dynamics
simulations fail to simulate relaxations from random structures, while training

    <p>Sublattice melting is the loss of order of one lattice component in binary or
ternary ionic crystals upon increase in temperature. A related transition has
been predicted in colloidal crystals. To understand the nature of this
transition, we study delocalization in self-assembled, size asymmetric binary
colloidal crystals using a generalized molecular dynamics model. Focusing on
BCC lattices, we observe a smooth change from localized-to-delocalized
interstitial particles for a variety of interaction strengths. Thermodynamic
arguments, mainly the absence of a discontinuity in the heat capacity, suggest
that the passage from localization-to-delocalization is continuous and not a
phase transition. This change is enhanced by lattice vibrations, and the
temperature of the onset of delocalization can be tuned by the strength of the
interaction between the colloid species. Therefore, the localized and
delocalized regimes of the sublattice are dominated by enthalpic and entropic
driving forces, respectively. This work sets the stage for future studies of
sublattice melting in colloidal systems with different stoichiometries and
lattice types, and it provides insights into superionic materials, which have
potential for application in energy storage technologies.</p>

    <p>Lattice constants such as unit cell edge lengths and plane angles are
important parameters of the periodic structures of crystal materials.
Predicting crystal lattice constants has wide applications in crystal structure
prediction and materials property prediction. Previous work has used machine
learning models such as neural networks and support vector machines combined
with composition features for lattice constant prediction and has achieved a
maximum performance for cubic structures with an average $R^2$ of 0.82. Other
models tailored for special materials family of a fixed form such as ABX3
perovskites can achieve much higher performance due to the homogeneity of the
structures. However, these models trained with small datasets are usually not
applicable to generic lattice parameter prediction of materials with diverse
compositions. Herein, we report MLatticeABC, a random forest machine learning
model with a new descriptor set for lattice unit cell edge length ($a,b,c$)
prediction which achieves an R2 score of 0.979 for lattice parameter $a$ of
cubic crystals and significant performance improvement for other crystal

Furthermore, we illustrate the potential of the method applied to the

relative concentration and $\alpha$ is the radius ratio of the small and large

where several structures are competitive to each other with respect to packing
fraction. Through the exhaustive search, diverse dense packings are discovered
and accordingly we find that packing structures achieve high packing fractions
by introducing distortion and/or combining a few local dense structural units.
Furthermore, we investigate the correspondence of the DBSP with crystals based
on the space group. The result shows that many structural units in real
crystals, e.g., $\mathrm{LaH_{10}}$ and $\mathrm{SrGe_{2-\delta}}$ being
high-pressure phases, can be understood as DBSP. The correspondence implies
that the densest sphere packings can be used effectively as structural
prototypes for searching complex crystal structures, especially for
high-pressure phases.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The accelerated growth rate of repository entries in crystallographic
databases makes it arduous to identify and classify their prototype structures.
The open-source AFLOW-XtalFinder package was developed to solve this problem.
It symbolically maps structures into standard designations following the AFLOW
Prototype Encyclopedia and calculates the internal degrees of freedom
consistent with the International Tables for Crystallography. To ensure
uniqueness, structures are analyzed and compared via symmetry, local atomic
geometries, and crystal mapping techniques, simultaneously grouping them by
similarity. The software i. distinguishes distinct crystal prototypes and atom
decorations, ii. determines equivalent spin configurations, iii. reveals
compounds with similar properties, and iv. guides the discovery of unexplored
materials. The operations are accessible through a Python module ready for
workflows, and through command line syntax. All the 4+ million compounds in the
AFLOW.org repositories are mapped to their ideal prototype, allowing users to
search database entries via symbolic structure-type. Furthermore, 15,000 unique
structures - sorted by prevalence - are extracted from the AFLOW-ICSD catalog
to serve as future prototypes in the Encyclopedia.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We develop a formalism to accurately account for the renormalization of
electronic structure due to quantum and thermal nuclear motions within the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We focus on the fundamental energy gap obtained
from electronic addition and removal energies from Quantum Monte Carlo
calculations in either the canonical or grand canonical ensembles. The
formalism applies as well to effective single electron theories such as those
based on Density Functional Theory. We show that electronic (Bloch) crystal
momentum can be restored by marginalizing the total electron-ion wave function
with respect to the nuclear equilibrium distribution, and we describe an
explicit procedure to establish the band structure of electronic excitations
for quantum crystals within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Based on the
Kubo-Greenwood equation, we discuss the effects of nuclear motion on optical
conductivity. Our methodology applies to the low temperature regime where
nuclear motion is quantized and in general differs from the semi-classical
approximation. We apply our method to study the electronic structure of C2/c-24
crystalline hydrogen at 200K and 250 GPa and discuss the optical absorption
profile of hydrogen crystal at 200K and carbon diamond at 297K.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Localized bases play an important role in understanding electronic structure.
In periodic insulators, a natural choice of localized basis is given by the
Wannier functions which depend a choice of unitary transform known as a gauge
transformation. Over the past few decades, there have been many works which
have focused on optimizing the choice of gauge so that the corresponding
Wannier functions are maximally localized or reflect some symmetry of the
underlying system. In this work, we consider fully non-periodic materials where
the usual Wannier functions are not well defined and gauge optimization is
impossible. To tackle the problem of calculating exponentially localized
generalized Wannier functions in both periodic and non-periodic system we
discuss the "Iterated Projected Position (IPP)" algorithm. The IPP algorithm is
based on matrix diagonalization and therefore unlike optimization based
approaches it does not require initialization and cannot get stuck at a local
minimum. Furthermore, the IPP algorithm is guaranteed by a rigorous analysis to
produce exponentially localized functions under certain mild assumptions. We
numerically demonstrate that the IPP algorithm can be used to calculate
exponentially localized bases for the Haldane model, the Kane-Mele model (in
both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant even and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant odd phases),
and the $p_x + i p_y$ model on a quasi-crystal lattice.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Engineering thermal transport in two dimensional materials, alloys and
heterostructures is critical for the design of next-generation flexible
optoelectronic and energy harvesting devices. Direct experimental
characterization of lattice thermal conductivity in these ultra-thin systems is
challenging and the impact of dopant atoms and hetero-phase interfaces,
introduced unintentionally during synthesis or as part of deliberate material
design, on thermal transport properties is not understood. Here, we use
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to calculate lattice thermal
conductivity of (Mo|W)Se$_2$ monolayer crystals including Mo$_{1-x}$W$_x$Se$_2$
alloys with substitutional point defects, periodic MoSe$_2$|WSe$_2$
heterostructures with characteristic length scales and scale-free fractal
MoSe$_2$|WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Each of these features has a distinct effect
on phonon propagation in the crystal, which can be used to design fractal and
periodic alloy structures with highly tunable thermal conductivities. This
control over lattice thermal conductivity will enable applications ranging from
thermal barriers to thermoelectrics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Predictive materials synthesis is the primary bottleneck in realizing new functional and quantum materials. Strategies for synthesis of promising materials are currently identified by time-consuming trial and error approaches and there are no known predictive schemes to design synthesis parameters for new materials. We use reinforcement learning to predict optimal synthesis schedules, i.e. a time-sequence of reaction conditions like temperatures and reactant concentrations, for the synthesis of a prototypical quantum material, semiconducting monolayer MoS$_{2}$, using chemical vapor deposition. The predictive reinforcement leaning agent is coupled to a deep generative model to capture the crystallinity and phase-composition of synthesized MoS$_{2}$ during CVD synthesis as a function of time-dependent synthesis conditions. This model, trained on 10000 computational synthesis simulations, successfully learned threshold temperatures and chemical potentials for the onset of chemical reactions and predicted new synthesis schedules for producing well-sulfidized crystalline and phase-pure MoS$_{2}$, which were validated by computational synthesis simulations. The model can be extended to predict profiles for synthesis of complex structures including multi-phase heterostructures and can also predict long-time behavior of reacting systems, far beyond the domain of the MD simulations used to train the model, making these predictions directly relevant to experimental synthesis.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Xenes, graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) monoelemental crystals with a
honeycomb symmetry, have been the focus of numerous experimental and
theoretical studies. In comparison, single-element 2D materials with a
triangular lattice symmetry have not received due attention. Here, taking Pb as
an example, we investigate the triangular-lattice monolayer made of group-IV
atoms employing first-principles density functional theory calculations. The
flat Pb monolayer supports a mirror-symmetry-protected spinless nodal line in
the absence spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The introduction of an out-of-plane
buckling creates a glide mirror, protecting an anisotropic Dirac nodal loop.
Both flat and buckled Pb monolayers become topologically trivial after
including SOC. A large buckling will make the Pb sheet a 2D semiconductor with
symmetry-protected Dirac points below the Fermi level. The electronic
structures of other group-IV triangular lattices such as Ge and Sn demonstrate
strong similarity to Pb. We further design a quasi-3D crystal PbHfO$_2$ by
alternately stacking Pb and 1T-HfO$_2$ monolayers. The new compound PbHfO$_2$
is dynamically stable and retains the properties of Pb monolayer. By applying
epitaxial strains to PbHfO$_2$, it is possible to drive an insulator-to-metal
transition coupled with an anti-ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition.
Our results suggest the potential of the 2D triangular lattice as a
complimentary platform to design new type of broadly-defined Xenes.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Volumetric crystal structure indexing and orientation mapping are key data
processing steps for virtually any quantitative study of spatial correlations
between the local chemistry and the microstructure of a material. For electron
and X-ray diffraction methods it is possible to develop indexing tools which
compare measured and analytically computed patterns to decode the structure and
relative orientation within local regions of interest. Consequently, a number
of numerically efficient and automated software tools exist to solve the above
characterisation tasks.
  For atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, however, the strategy of making
comparisons between measured and analytically computed patterns is less robust
because many APT datasets may contain substantial noise. Given that general
enough predictive models for such noise remain elusive, crystallography tools
for APT face several limitations: Their robustness to noise, and therefore,
their capability to identify and distinguish different crystal structures and
orientation is limited. In addition, the tools are sequential and demand
substantial manual interaction. In combination, this makes robust uncertainty
quantifying with automated high-throughput studies of the latent
crystallographic information a difficult task with APT data.
  To improve the situation, we review the existent methods and discuss how they
link to those in the diffraction communities. With this we modify some of the
APT methods to yield more robust descriptors of the atomic arrangement. We
report how this enables the development of an open-source software tool for
strong-scaling and automated identifying of crystal structure and mapping
crystal orientation in nanocrystalline APT datasets with multiple phases.</p>

    <p>Solutions to the differential equations of linear elasticity in the continuum
limit in arbitrary crystal symmetry are known only for steady-state
dislocations of arbitrary character, i.e. line defects moving at constant
velocity. Troubled by singularities at certain `critical' velocities (typically
close to certain sound speeds), these dislocation fields are thought to be too
idealized, and divergences are usually attributed to neglecting the finite size
of the core and to the restriction to constant velocity. In the isotropic
limit, accelerating pure screw and edge dislocations were studied some time
ago. A generalization to anisotropic crystals has been attempted for pure screw
and edge dislocations only for some special cases. This work aims to fill the
gap of deriving a general anisotropic solution for pure screw dislocations
applicable to slip systems featuring a reflection symmetry, a prerequisite to
studying pure screw dislocations without mixing with edge dislocations. Further
generalizations to arbitrary mixed dislocations as well as regularizations of
the dislocation core are beyond the scope of this paper and are left for future
work.</p>

    <p>Prediction of the stable crystal structure for multinary (ternary or higher)
compounds with unexplored compositions demands fast and accurate evaluation of
free energies in exploring the vast configurational space. The machine-learning
potential such as the neural network potential (NNP) is poised to meet this
requirement but a dearth of information on the crystal structure poses a
challenge in choosing training sets. Herein we propose constructing the
training set from densityfunctional-theory (DFT) based dynamical trajectories
of liquid and quenched amorphous phases, which does not require any preceding
information on material structures except for the chemical composition. To
demonstrate suitability of the trained NNP in the crystal structure prediction,
we compare NNP and DFT energies for Ba2AgSi3, Mg2SiO4, LiAlCl4, and InTe2O5F
over experimental phases as well as low-energy crystal structures that are
generated theoretically. For every material, we find strong correlations
between DFT and NNP energies, ensuring that the NNPs can properly rank energies
among low-energy crystalline structures. We also find that the evolutionary
search using the NNPs can identify low-energy metastable phases more
efficiently than the DFTbased approach. By proposing a way to developing
reliable machine-learning potentials for the crystal structure prediction, this
work will pave the way to identifying unexplored multinary phases efficiently.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>An efficient machine-learning-based method combined with a conventional local
optimization technique has been proposed for exploring local energy minima of
interstitial species in a crystal. In the proposed method, an effective initial
point for local optimization is sampled at each iteration from a given feasible
set in the search space. The effective initial point is here defined as the
grid point that most likely converges to a new local energy minimum by local
optimization and/or is located in the vicinity of the boundaries between energy
basins. Specifically, every grid point in the feasible set is classified by the
predicted label indicating the local energy minimum that the grid point
converges to. The classifier is created and updated at every iteration using
the already-known information on the local optimizations at the earlier
iterations, which is based on the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM
classifier uses our original kernel function designed as reflecting the
symmetries of both host crystal and interstitial species. The most distant
unobserved point on the classification boundaries from the observed points is
sampled as the next initial point for local optimization. The proposed method
is applied to three model cases, i.e., the six-hump camelback function, a
proton in strontium zirconate with the orthorhombic perovskite structure, and a
water molecule in lanthanum sulfate with the monoclinic structure, to
demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Crystal structure prediction is now playing an increasingly important role in
discovery of new materials. Global optimization methods such as genetic
algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been combined with
first principle free energy calculations to predict crystal structures given
composition or only a chemical system. While these approaches can exploit
certain crystal patterns such as symmetry and periodicity in their search
process, they usually do not exploit the large amount of implicit rules and
constraints of atom configurations embodied in the large number of known
crystal structures. They currently can only handle crystal structure prediction
of relatively small systems. Inspired by the knowledge-rich protein structure
prediction approach, herein we explore whether known geometric constraints such
as the atomic contact map of a target crystal material can help predict its
structure given its space group information. We propose a global optimization
based algorithm, CMCrystal, for crystal structure reconstruction based on
atomic contact maps. Based on extensive experiments using six global
optimization algorithms, we show that it is viable to reconstruct the crystal
structure given the atomic contact map for some crystal materials but more
constraints are needed for other target materials to achieve successful
reconstruction. This implies that atomic interaction information learned from
existing materials can be used to improve crystal structure prediction.</p>

as-indacenes (PAI) in a zigzag pattern, namely PAI-graphene whose energy is
lower than most of the reported 2D allotropes of graphene. Crucially, the
crystal structure realizes a nonsymmorphic layer group that enforces a
nontrivial global topology of the band structure with two Dirac cones lying
perfectly at the Fermi level. The absence of electron/hole pockets makes
PAI-graphene a pristine crystalline topological semimetal having anisotropic
Fermi velocities with a high value of $7.0 \times 10^{5}$ m/s. We show that
while the semimetallic property of the allotrope is robust against the
application of strain, the positions of the Dirac cone and the Fermi velocities
can be modified significantly with strain. Moreover, by combining strain along
both the x- and y-directions, two band inversions take place at $\Gamma$
leading to the annihilation of the Dirac nodes demonstrating the possibility of
strain-controlled conversion of a topological semimetal into a semiconductor.
Finally we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence of the topological nodal
phase in the form of a generalized Zak-phase argument finding a perfect
agreement with the topological edge states computed for different
edge-terminations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Autonomous materials discovery with desired properties is one of the ultimate
goals for materials science, and the current studies have been focusing mostly
on high-throughput screening based on density functional theory calculations
and forward modelling of physical properties using machine learning. Applying
the deep learning techniques, we have developed a generative model which can
predict distinct stable crystal structures by optimizing the formation energy
in the latent space. It is demonstrated that the optimization of physical
properties can be integrated into the generative model as on-top screening or
backwards propagator, both with their own advantages. Applying the generative
models on the binary Bi-Se system reveals that distinct crystal structures can
be obtained covering the whole composition range, and the phases on the convex
hull can be reproduced after the generated structures are fully relaxed to the
equilibrium. The method can be extended to multicomponent systems for
multi-objective optimization, which paves the way to achieve the inverse design
of materials with optimal properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The coupling between electrons and phonons in solids plays a central role in
describing many phenomena, including superconductivity and thermoelecric
transport. Calculations of this coupling are exceedingly demanding as they
necessitate integrations over both the electron and phonon momenta, both of
which span the Brillouin zone of the crystal, independently. We present here an
ab initio method for efficiently calculating electron-phonon mediated transport
properties by dramatically accelerating the computation of the double integrals
with a dual interpolation technique that combines maximally localized Wannier
functions with symmetry-adapted plane waves. The performance gain in relation
to the current state-of-the-art Wannier-Fourier interpolation is approximately
2n_s \times M, where n_s is the number of crystal symmetry operations and M, a
number in the range 5 - 60, governs the expansion in star functions. We
demonstrate with several examples how our method performs some ab initio
calculations involving electron-phonon interactions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This manuscript presents, to our knowledge, the first fully ab initio
many-body photoemission framework to predict the transverse momentum
distributions and the mean transverse energies (MTEs) of photoelectrons from
single-crystal photocathodes. The need to develop such a theory stems from the
lack of studies that provide complete understanding of the underlying
fundamental processes governing the transverse momentum distribution of
photoelectrons emitted from single crystals. For example, initial predictions
based on density-functional theory calculations of effective electron masses
suggested that the (111) surface of PbTe would produce very small MTEs ($\leq$
15 meV), whereas our experiments yielded MTEs ten to twenty times larger than
these predictions, and also exhibited a lower photoemission threshold than
predicted. The ab initio framework presented in this manuscript correctly
reproduces the magnitude of the MTEs from our measurements in PbTe(111) and
also the observed photoemission below the predicted threshold. Our results show
that photoexcitations into bulk-like states and coherent, many-body
electron-photon-phonon scattering processes, both of which initial predictions
ignored, indeed play important roles in photoemission from PbTe(111). Finally,
from the lessons learned, we recommend a procedure for rapid computational
screening of potential single-crystal photocathodes for applications in
next-generation ultrafast electron diffraction and X-ray free-electron lasers,
which will enable new, significant advances in condensed matter research.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Module for ab initio structure evolution (MAISE) is an open-source package
for materials modeling and prediction. The code's main feature is an automated
generation of neural network (NN) interatomic potentials for use in global
structure searches. The systematic construction of Behler-Parrinello-type NN
models approximating ab initio energy and forces relies on two approaches
introduced in our recent studies. An evolutionary sampling scheme for
generating reference structures improves the NNs' mapping of regions visited in
unconstrained searches, while a stratified training approach enables the
creation of standardized NN models for multiple elements. A more flexible NN
architecture proposed here expands the applicability of the stratified scheme
for an arbitrary number of elements. The full workflow in the NN development is
managed with a customizable 'MAISE-NET' wrapper written in Python. The global
structure optimization capability in MAISE is based on an evolutionary
algorithm applicable for nanoparticles, films, and bulk crystals. A multitribe
extension of the algorithm allows for an efficient simultaneous optimization of
nanoparticles in a given size range. Implemented structure analysis functions
include fingerprinting with radial distribution functions and finding space
groups with the SPGLIB tool. This work overviews MAISE's available features,
constructed models, and confirmed predictions.</p>

    <p>Realizing general inverse design could greatly accelerate the discovery of
new materials with user-defined properties. However, state-of-the-art
generative models tend to be limited to a specific composition or crystal
structure. Herein, we present a framework capable of general inverse design
(not limited to a given set of elements or crystal structures), featuring a
generalized invertible representation that encodes crystals in both real and
reciprocal space, and a property-structured latent space from a variational
autoencoder (VAE). In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new
crystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE)
power factor, and combinations thereof. These generated crystals, absent in the
training database, are validated by first-principles calculations. The success
rates (number of first-principles-validated target-satisfying crystals/number
of designed crystals) ranges between 7.1% and 38.9%. These results represent a
significant step toward property-driven general inverse design using generative
models, although practical challenges remain when coupled with experimental
synthesis.</p>

    <p>We address the question of why larger, high symmetry crystals are mostly
weak, ductile and statistically sub-critical, while smaller crystals with the
same symmetry are strong, brittle and super-critical. We link it to another
question of why intermittent elasto-plastic deformation of sub-micron crystals
features highly unusual size sensitivity of scaling exponents. We use a minimal
integer-valued automaton model of crystal plasticity to show that with growing
variance of quenched disorder, which can serve in this case as a proxy for
increasing size, sub-micron crystals undergo a crossover from spin-glass
marginality to criticality characterizing the second order brittle-to-ductile
(BD) transition. We argue that this crossover is behind the non-universality of
scaling exponents observed in physical and numerical experiments. The
non-universality emerges only if the quenched disorder is elastically
incompatible and it disappears if the disorder is compatible.</p>

    <p>We develop and demonstrate the first general computational tool for finite
deformation static and dynamic dislocation mechanics. A finite element
formulation of finite deformation (Mesoscale) Field Dislocation Mechanics
theory is presented. The model is a minimal enhancement of classical
crystal/$J_2$ plasticity that fundamentally accounts for polar/excess
dislocations at the mesoscale. It has the ability to compute the static and
dynamic finite deformation stress fields of arbitrary (evolving) dislocation
distributions in finite bodies of arbitrary shape and elastic anisotropy under
general boundary conditions. This capability is used to present a comparison of
the static stress fields, at finite and small deformations, for screw and edge
dislocations, revealing heretofore unexpected differences. The computational
framework is verified against the sharply contrasting predictions of
geometrically linear and nonlinear theories for the stress field of a spatially
homogeneous dislocation distribution in the body, as well as against other
exact results of the theory. Verification tests of the time-dependent numerics
are also presented. Size effects in crystal and isotropic versions of the
theory are shown to be a natural consequence of the model and are validated
against available experimental data. With inertial effects incorporated, the
development of an (asymmetric) propagating Mach cone is demonstrated in the
finite deformation theory when a dislocation moves at speeds greater than the
linear elastic shear wave speed of the material.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The constant demand for new functional materials calls for efficient
strategies to accelerate the materials design and discovery. In addressing this
challenge, machine learning generative models can offer promising opportunities
since they allow for the continuous navigation of chemical space via low
dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we employ a crystal representation
that is inversion-free with a low memory requirement based on unit cell
information and fractional atomic coordinates, and build the generative
adversarial network (GAN) for crystal structures. The proposed model is then
applied to the Mg-Mn-O ternary inorganic materials system to generate novel
structures with application as potential water-splitting photoanodes, and
combined with the evaluation of their photoanode properties for high-throughput
virtual screening (HTVS). The generative-HTVS system that we built predicts 23
new crystal structures with a reasonable predicted stability and bandgap. These
findings suggest that the proposed generative model can be an effective way to
explore hidden portions of the chemical space, an area that is usually
unreachable when conventional substitution-based discovery is employed.</p>

    <p>The large-scale search for high-performing candidate 2D materials is limited
to calculating a few simple descriptors, usually with first-principles density
functional theory calculations. In this work, we alleviate this issue by
extending and generalizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks to
systems with planar periodicity, and train an ensemble of models to predict
thermodynamic, mechanical, and electronic properties. To demonstrate the
utility of this approach, we carry out a screening of nearly 45,000 structures
for two largely disjoint applications: namely, mechanically robust composites
and photovoltaics. An analysis of the uncertainty associated with our methods
indicates the ensemble of neural networks is well-calibrated and has errors
comparable with those from accurate first-principles density functional theory
calculations. The ensemble of models allows us to gauge the confidence of our
predictions, and to find the candidates most likely to exhibit effective
performance in their applications. Since the datasets used in our screening
were combinatorically generated, we are also able to investigate, using an
innovative method, structural and compositional design principles that impact
the properties of the structures surveyed and which can act as a generative
model basis for future material discovery through reverse engineering. Our
approach allowed us to recover some well-accepted design principles: for
instance, we find that hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with lead and tin
tend to be good candidates for solar cell applications.</p>

    <p>Materials representation plays a key role in machine learning based
prediction of materials properties and new materials discovery. Currently both
graph and 3D voxel representation methods are based on the heterogeneous
elements of the crystal structures. Here, we propose to use electronic charge
density (ECD) as a generic unified 3D descriptor for materials property
prediction with the advantage of possessing close relation with the physical
and chemical properties of materials. We developed an ECD based 3D
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting elastic properties of
materials, in which CNNs can learn effective hierarchical features with
multiple convolving and pooling operations. Extensive benchmark experiments
over 2,170 Fm-3m face-centered-cubic (FCC) materials show that our ECD based
CNNs can achieve good performance for elasticity prediction. Especially, our
CNN models based on the fusion of elemental Magpie features and ECD descriptors
achieved the best 5-fold cross-validation performance. More importantly, we
showed that our ECD based CNN models can achieve significantly better
extrapolation performance when evaluated over non-redundant datasets where
there are few neighbor training samples around test samples. As additional
validation, we evaluated the predictive performance of our models on 329
materials of space group Fm-3m by comparing to DFT calculated values, which
shows better prediction power of our model for bulk modulus than shear modulus.
Due to the unified representation power of ECD, it is expected that our ECD
based CNN approach can also be applied to predict other physical and chemical
properties of crystalline materials.</p>

    <p>Accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations depends crucially on the
interatomic potential used to generate forces. The gold standard would be
first-principles quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, but these become
prohibitively expensive at large simulation scales. Machine learning (ML) based
potentials aim for faithful emulation of QM at drastically reduced
computational cost. The accuracy and robustness of an ML potential is primarily
limited by the quality and diversity of the training dataset. Using the
principles of active learning (AL), we present a highly automated approach to
dataset construction. The strategy is to use the ML potential under development
to sample new atomic configurations and, whenever a configuration is reached
for which the ML uncertainty is sufficiently large, collect new QM data. Here,
we seek to push the limits of automation, removing as much expert knowledge
from the AL process as possible. All sampling is performed using MD simulations
starting from an initially disordered configuration, and undergoing
non-equilibrium dynamics as driven by time-varying applied temperatures. We
demonstrate this approach by building an ML potential for aluminum (ANI-Al).
After many AL iterations, ANI-Al teaches itself to predict properties like the
radial distribution function in melt, liquid-solid coexistence curve, and
crystal properties such as defect energies and barriers. To demonstrate
transferability, we perform a 1.3M atom shock simulation, and show that ANI-Al
predictions agree very well with DFT calculations on local atomic environments
sampled from the nonequilibrium dynamics. Interestingly, the configurations
appearing in shock appear to have been well sampled in the AL training dataset,
in a way that we illustrate visually.</p>

    <p>The second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) processes, such as the photogalvanic
effect and second-order harmonic generation (SHG), play crucial roles in
probing and controlling light-matter interactions for energy and device
applications. To date, most studies of second-order NLO processes focus on
materials with broken spatial inversion symmetry, such as proper ferroelectrics
and noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetals. Nevertheless, inversion symmetry of
Shubnikov groups can be broken via spin-ordering in centrosymmetric crystals.
Unfortunately, these materials are less common, and their NLO responses are
usually weak. Combining quantum perturbation theory and first-principles
simulations, we predict a giant injection-current photogalvanic effect and SHG
in a family of emerging axion insulators, the even septuple layers of MnBi2Te4
(MBT) materials that exhibit the zero-plateau quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)
effect. Their amplitudes of injection current and SHG are about two orders of
magnitude larger than those of widely used ferroelectrics, such as BiFeO3 and
LiNbO3. Moreover, unlike the usual injection current observed under
circularly-polarized light, the injection photocurrent of MBTs only emerges
under linearly polarized light, making it convenient for device applications.
These unique characters are from a combination effect of parity-time symmetry,
three-fold rotation symmetry, and significant spin-orbit coupling. These
enhanced NLO effects are valuable for characterizing subtle topological orders
in QAH systems and also shed light on novel infrared photo-detector and
photovoltaic applications based on magnetic topological materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Theoretical and experimental studies have revealed that electrons in
condensed matter can behave hydrodynamically, exhibiting fluid phenomena such
as Stokes flow and vortices. Unlike classical fluids, preferred directions
inside crystals lift isotropic restrictions, necessitating a generalized
treatment of electron hydrodynamics. We explore electron fluid behaviors
arising from the most general viscosity tensors in two and three dimensions,
constrained only by thermodynamics and crystal symmetries. Hexagonal 2D
materials such as graphene support flows indistinguishable from those of an
isotropic fluid. By contrast 3D materials including Weyl semimetals, exhibit
significant deviations from isotropy. Breaking time-reversal symmetry, for
example in magnetic topological materials, introduces a non-dissipative Hall
component to the viscosity tensor. While this vanishes by isotropy in 3D,
anisotropic materials can exhibit nonzero Hall viscosity components. We show
that in 3D anisotropic materials the electronic fluid stress can couple to the
vorticity without breaking time-reversal symmetry. Our work demonstrates the
anomalous landscape for electron hydrodynamics in systems beyond graphene, and
presents experimental geometries to quantify the effects of electronic
viscosity.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) has attracted considerable interest as a
promising electrolyte material for potential use in lithium batteries. However,
its electronic properties are still not thoroughly understood. In this work,
density functional theory calculations were adopted, our calculations find out
that Li2SiO3 exhibits unique lattice symmetry (orthorhombic crystal), valence
and conduction bands, charge density distribution, and van Hove singularities.
Delicate analyses, the critical multi-orbital hybridizations in Li-O and Si-O
bonds 2s- (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) and (3s, 3px, 3py, 3pz)- (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz),
respectively was identified. In particular, this system shows a huge
indirect-gap of 5.077 eV. Therefore, there exist many strong covalent bonds,
with obvious anisotropy and non-uniformity. On the other hand, the
spin-dependent magnetic configurations are thoroughly absent. The theoretical
framework could be generalized to explore the essential properties of cathode
and anode materials of oxide compounds.</p>

    <p>Crystallization kinetics has features that are universal and independent of
the type of crystallized system. The possibility of using scaling relations to
describe the temperature dependences of the surface self-diffusion coefficient
$D_s$, which is one of the key characteristics of crystallization kinetics, has
been demonstrated in application to various crystallized molecular glasses. It
has been shown that the surface self-diffusion coefficient $D_s$ as a function
of the dimensionless temperature is reproduced by a power law and is
universally scaled for all considered systems. The analysis of experimental
data has revealed a correlation between the crystallization kinetic
characteristics, index of fragility, and criterion of the glass-forming ability
of a liquid. It has been shown that this correlation can be obtained within the
generalized Einstein-Stokes relation.</p>

    <p>We carry out X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiment at oxygen K-edge in
croconic acid (C5H2O5) crystal as a prototype of ferroelectric organic
molecular solid, whose electric polarization is generated by proton transfer.
The experimental spectrum is well reproduced by the electron-hole excitation

hydrogen bonding environment on the two bonded molecules become inequivalent.
Such a difference is sensitively probed by the bound excitation in the
pre-edge, which are strongly localized on the excited molecules. Our analysis
shows that a satellite peak in the pre-edge will emerge at higher excitation

    <p>Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroics exhibit cross-control capacity between
magnetic and electric responses in reduced spatial domain, making them well
suited for next-generation nanoscale devices; however, progress has been slow
in developing materials with required characteristic properties. Here we
identify by first-principles calculations robust 2D multiferroic behaviors in
decorated Fe2O3 monolayer, showcasing N@Fe2O3 as a prototypical case, where
ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism stem from the same origin, namely Fe
d-orbit splitting induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion and associated crystal
field changes. The resulting ferromagnetic and ferroelectric polarization can
be effectively reversed and regulated by applied electric field or strain,
offering efficient functionality. These findings establish strong materials
phenomena and elucidate underlying physics mechanism in a family of truly 2D
multiferroics that are highly promising for advanced device applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The identification of general principles for stabilizing magnetic skyrmion
phases in bulk materials over wide ranges of temperatures is a prerequisite to
the development of skyrmion-based spintronic devices. Lacunar spinels with the
formula GaM4X8 with M=V, Mo; X=S, Se are a convenient case study towards this
goal as they are some of the first bulk systems suggested to host equilibrium
chiral skyrmions far from the paramagnetic transition. We derive the magnetic
phase diagrams likely to be observed in these materials, accounting for all
possible magnetic interactions, and prove that skyrmion stability in the
lacunar spinels is a general consequence of their crystal symmetry rather than
the details of the material chemistry. Our results are consistent with all
experimental reports in this space and demonstrate that the differences in the
phase diagrams of particular spinel chemistries are determined by
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, up to a normalization factor. We conclude that
skyrmion formation over wide ranges of temperatures can be expected in all
lacunar spinels, as well as in a wide range of uniaxial systems with low
magnetocrystalline anisotropy.</p>

    <p>We present PyXtal, a new package based on the Python programming language,
used to generate structures with specific symmetry and chemical compositions
for both atomic and molecular systems. This soft ware provides support for
various systems described by point, rod, layer, and space group symmetries.
With only the inputs of chemical composition and symmetry group information,
PyXtal can automatically find a suitable combination of Wyckoff positions with
a step-wise merging scheme. Further, when the molecular geometry is given,
PyXtal can generate different dimensional organic crystals with molecules
occupying both general and special Wyckoff positions. Optionally, PyXtal also
accepts user-defined parameters (e.g., cell parameters, minimum distances and
Wyckoff positions). In general, PyXtal serves three purposes: (1) to generate
custom structures, (2) to modulate the structure by symmetry relations, (3) to
interface the existing structure prediction codes that require the generation
of random symmetric structures. In addition, we provide several utilities that
facilitate the analysis of structures, including symmetry analysis, geometry
optimization, and simulations of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Full

    <p>The analysis of the damage on plasma facing materials (PFM), due to its
direct interaction with the plasma environment, is needed to build the next
generation of nuclear machines, where tungsten has been proposed as a
candidate. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a
machine learned inter-atomic potential, based on the Gaussian Approximation
Potential framework, to model better neutron bombardment mechanisms in pristine
W lattices. The MD potential is trained to reproduce realistic short-range
dynamics, the liquid phase, and the material recrystallization, which are
important for collision cascades. The formation of point defects is quantified
and classified by a descriptor vector (DV) based method, which is independent
of the sample temperature and its constituents, requiring only modest
computational resources. The locations of vacancies are calculated by the
k-d-tree algorithm. The analysis of the damage in the W samples is compared to
results obtained by EAM Finnis-Sinclair and Tersoff-ZBL potentials, at a sample
temperature of 300 K and a primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy range of 0.5-10
keV, where a good agreement with the reported number of Frenkel pair is
observed. Our results provide information about the advantages and limits of
the machine learned MD simulations with respect to the standard ones. The
formation of dumbbell and crowdion defects as a function of PKA is discussed.</p>

    <p>Generative models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and

and show that CondGAN using the bag-of-atom representation with physical

we evaluate the effectiveness of the Metropolis-Hastings-based atomic valency

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We describe a method to calculate the electronic properties of an insulator
under an applied electric field. It is based on the minimization of an electric
enthalpy functional with respect to the orbitals, which behave as Wannier
functions under crystal translations, but are not necessarily orthogonal. This
paper extends the approach of Nunes and Vanderbilt (NV) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 73,
712 (1994)], who demonstrated that a Wannier function representation can be
used to study insulating crystals in the presence of a finite electric field.
According to a study by Fern\'{a}ndez et al. [Phys. Rev. B. 58, R7480 (1998)],
first-principles implementations of the NV approach suffer from the impact of
the localization constraint on the orthogonal wave functions, what affects the
accuracy of the physical results. We show that because non-orthogonal
generalized Wannier functions can be more localized than their orthogonal
counterparts, the error due to localization constraints is reduced, thus
improving the accuracy of the calculated physical quantities.</p>

seamless spectral expansion of lattice Green's functions, which enables
large-scale calculations of generic target functions with uniform convergence
and fine control over energy resolution. Several functionalities are
demonstrated, ranging from simulations of local density of states and
photo-emission spectroscopy of disordered materials to large-scale computations
of optical conductivity tensors and real-space wave-packet propagation in the
presence of magneto-static fields and spin-orbit coupling. On-the-fly
calculations of real-space Green's functions are carried out with an efficient
domain decomposition technique, allowing KITE to achieve nearly ideal linear
scaling in its multi-threading performance. Crystalline defects and disorder,
including vacancies, adsorbates and charged impurity centers, can be easily set

    <p>The phase-field crystal model in its amplitude equation approximation is
shown to provide an accurate description of the deformation field in defected
crystalline structures, as well as of dislocation motion. We analyze in detail
the elastic distortion and stress regularization at a dislocation core and show
how the Burgers vector density can be directly computed from the topological
singularities of the phase-field amplitudes. Distortions arising from these
amplitudes are then supplemented with non-singular displacements to enforce
mechanical equilibrium. This allows for the consistent separation of plastic
and elastic time scales in this framework. A finite element method is
introduced to solve the combined amplitude and elasticity equations, which is
applied to a few prototypical configurations in two spatial dimensions for a
crystal of triangular lattice symmetry: i) the stress field induced by an edge
dislocation with an analysis of how the amplitude equation regularizes stresses
near the dislocation core, ii) the motion of a dislocation dipole as a result
of its internal interaction, and iii) the shrinkage of a rotated grain. We also
compare our results with those given by other extensions of classical
elasticity theory, such as strain-gradient elasticity and methods based on the
smoothing of Burgers vector densities near defect cores.</p>

    <p>Machine learning has the potential to accelerate materials discovery by
accurately predicting materials properties at a low computational cost.
However, the model inputs remain a key stumbling block. Current methods
typically use descriptors constructed from knowledge of either the full crystal
structure -- therefore only applicable to materials with already characterised
structures -- or structure-agnostic fixed-length representations
hand-engineered from the stoichiometry. We develop a machine learning approach
that takes only the stoichiometry as input and automatically learns appropriate
and systematically improvable descriptors from data. Our key insight is to
treat the stoichiometric formula as a dense weighted graph between elements.
Compared to the state of the art for structure-agnostic methods, our approach
achieves lower errors with less data.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The point of zero gradient of the electronic band structure--critical
point--generally induces the singularity in the density of states (DOS), but no
isolated critical point yields strict divergence of the DOS in three
dimensions, differently from the lower dimensional cases. In view of the band
structure as a smooth hypersurface on the reciprocal space, we discuss the
minimal deformation of the band structure that yields non-divergent but large
sharp DOS peaks in three dimensions. By "pushing down" the energy level at the
second order saddle point (maximum), a continuous closed loop of saddle points
(sphere of maxima) encircling the original position of the saddle point
(maximum) emerges, with which the DOS peak is formed. Being high dimensional
features, the saddle loop and extremum shell thus formed are difficult to
locate with standard band structure analysis on linear ${\bf k}$-point paths.
The Lifshitz transition occurring over a linear or planar manifold is discussed
as an indicator of such features. We also find that the celebrated DOS peak in
the recently discovered superconducting hydride H$_{3}$S originates from the
saddle loop. On this basis, we successfully extract the minimal model that
explains how the DOS peak is formed. Our theory characterizes a large class of
DOS peaks sometimes found in the three dimensional electronic structures,
building a basis for profound understanding of their origins.</p>

    <p>Generative models have achieved impressive results in many domains including
image and text generation. In the natural sciences, generative models have led
to rapid progress in automated drug discovery. Many of the current methods
focus on either 1-D or 2-D representations of typically small, drug-like
molecules. However, many molecules require 3-D descriptors and exceed the
chemical complexity of commonly used dataset. We present a method to encode and
decode the position of atoms in 3-D molecules from a dataset of nearly 50,000
stable crystal unit cells that vary from containing 1 to over 100 atoms. We
construct a smooth and continuous 3-D density representation of each crystal
based on the positions of different atoms. Two different neural networks were
trained on a dataset of over 120,000 three-dimensional samples of single and
repeating crystal structures, made by rotating the single unit cells. The
first, an Encoder-Decoder pair, constructs a compressed latent space
representation of each molecule and then decodes this description into an
accurate reconstruction of the input. The second network segments the resulting
output into atoms and assigns each atom an atomic number. By generating
compressed, continuous latent spaces representations of molecules we are able
to decode random samples, interpolate between two molecules, and alter known
molecules.</p>

    <p>We demonstrate that nascent polymer crystals (i.e., nuclei) are anisotropic
entities, with neither spherical nor cylindrical geometry, in contrast to
previous assumptions. In fact, cylindrical, spherical, and other high symmetry
geometries are thermodynamically unfavorable. Moreover, post-critical
transitions are necessary to achieve the lamellae that ultimately arise during
the crystallization of semicrystalline polymers. We also highlight how
inaccurate treatments of polymer nucleation can lead to substantial errors
(e.g., orders of magnitude discrepancies in predicted nucleation rates). These
insights are based on quantitative analysis of over four million crystal
clusters from the crystallization of prototypical entangled polyethylene melts.
New comprehensive bottom-up models are needed to capture polymer nucleation.</p>

    <p>Anisotropic core-shell model of a nano-grained polycrystal, proposed recently
for nanocrystalline copper, is applied to estimate elastic effective properties
for a set of crystals of cubic symmetry. Materials selected for analysis differ
in the lattice geometry (face-centered cubic vs. body-centered cubic) as well
as the value of a Zener factor: a ratio of two shear moduli defining elastic
anisotropy of a cubic crystal. The predictions are verified by means of the
atomistic simulations. The dependence of the overall bulk and shear moduli on
the average grain diameter is analysed. In the mean-field approach the
thickness of the shell is specified by the \emph{cutoff radius} of a
corresponding atomistic potential, while the grain shell is isotropic and its
properties are identified by molecular simulations performed for very small
grains with approximately all atoms belonging to the grain boundary zone. It is
shown that the core-shell model provides predictions of satisfactory
qualitative and quantitative agreement with atomistic simulations. Performed
study indicates that the variation of the bulk and shear moduli with the grain
size changes qualitatively when the Zener anisotropy factor is smaller or
greater than one.</p>

    <p>Single-layer superconductors are ideal materials for fabricating
superconducting nano devices. However, up to date, very few single-layer
elemental superconductors have been predicted and especially no one has been
successfully synthesized yet. Here, using crystal structure search techniques
and ab initio calculations, we predict that a single-layer planar carbon sheet
with 4- and 8-membered rings called T-graphene is a new intrinsic elemental
superconductor with superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to around 20.8
K. More importantly, we propose a synthesis route to obtain such a single-layer
T-graphene, that is, a T-graphene potassium intercalation compound (C4K with
P4/mmm symmetry) is firstly synthesized at high pressure (>11.5GPa) and then
quenched to ambient condition; and finally, the single-layer T-graphene can be
either exfoliated using the electrochemical method from the bulk C4K, or peeled
off from bulk T-graphite C4, where C4 can be obtained from C4K by evaporating
the K atoms. Interestingly, we find that the calculated Tc of C4K is about
30.4K at 0GPa, which sets a new record for layered carbon-based
superconductors. The present findings add a new class of carbon based
superconductors. In particular, once the single-layer T-graphene is
synthesized, it can pave the way for fabricating superconducting devices
together with other 2D materials using the layer-by-layer growth techniques.</p>

    <p>Computational modeling of the properties of crystalline materials has become
an increasingly important aspect of materials research, consuming hundreds of
millions of CPU-hours at scientific computing centres around the world each
year, if not more. A routine operation in such calculations is the evaluation
of integrals over the Brillouin zone. We have previously demonstrated that
performing such integrals using generalized Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids can
roughly double the speed of these calculations relative to the widely-used
traditional Monkhorst-Pack grids, and such grids can be rapidly generated by
querying a free, internet-accessible database of pre-generated grids. To
facilitate the widespread use of generalized k-point grids, we present new
algorithms that allow rapid generation of optimized generalized Monkhorst-Pack
grids on the fly, an open-source library to facilitate their integration into
external software packages, and an open-source implementation of the database
tool that can be used offline. We also present benchmarks of the speed of our
algorithms on structures randomly selected from the Inorganic Crystal Structure
Database. For grids that correspond to a real-space supercell with at least 50
angstroms between lattice points, which is sufficient to converge density
functional theory calculations within 1 meV/atom for nearly all materials, our
algorithm finds optimized grids in an average of 0.19 seconds on a single
processing core. For 100 angstroms between real-space lattice points, our

    <p>Compound-tunable embedding potential (CTEP) method is proposed. A fragment of
some chemical compound, "main cluster" in the present paper, is limited by
boundary anions such that the nearest environmental atoms are cations. The CTEP
method is based on constructing the embedding potential as linear combination
of short-range "electron-free" spherical "tunable" pseudopotentials for cations
from nearest environment of the main cluster, whereas the long-range CTEP part
consists of Coulomb potentials from optimized fractional point charges centered
on both environmental cations and anions.
  A pilot application of the CTEP method to the fersmite crystal,
CaNb$_2$O$_6$, is performed and a remarkable agreement of the electronic
density and interatomic distances within the fragment with those of the
original periodic crystal calculation is attained. Characteristics of
"atoms-in-compounds" which are of great importance for compound of $f$- and
$d$-elements (Nb in fersmite) are considered on examples of chemical shifts of
$K_{{\alpha}_{1,2}}\ $ and $K_{{\beta}_{1,2}}\ $ lines of X-ray emission
spectra in niobium. A very promising potential of this approach in studying
variety of properties of point defects containing $f$- and heavy $d$-elements
with relativistic effects, extended basis set and broken crystal symmetry
considered is discussed.</p>

    <p>Materials discovery is crucial for making scientific advances in many
domains. Collections of data from experiments and first-principle computations
have spurred interest in applying machine learning methods to create predictive
models capable of mapping from composition and crystal structures to materials
properties. Generally, these are regression problems with the input being a 1D
vector composed of numerical attributes representing the material composition
and/or crystal structure. While neural networks consisting of fully connected
layers have been applied to such problems, their performance often suffers from
the vanishing gradient problem when network depth is increased. In this paper,
we study and propose design principles for building deep regression networks
composed of fully connected layers with numerical vectors as input. We
introduce a novel deep regression network with individual residual learning,
IRNet, that places shortcut connections after each layer so that each layer
learns the residual mapping between its output and input. We use the problem of
learning properties of inorganic materials from numerical attributes derived
from material composition and/or crystal structure to compare IRNet's
performance against that of other machine learning techniques. Using multiple
datasets from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and Materials Project
for training and evaluation, we show that IRNet provides significantly better
prediction performance than the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches
currently used by domain scientists. We also show that IRNet's use of
individual residual learning leads to better convergence during the training
phase than when shortcut connections are between multi-layer stacks while
maintaining the same number of parameters.</p>

    <p>We introduce a deep neural network to model in a symmetry preserving way the
environmental dependence of the centers of the electronic charge. The model
learns from ab-initio density functional theory, wherein the electronic centers
are uniquely assigned by the maximally localized Wannier functions. When
combined with the Deep Potential model of the atomic potential energy surface,
the scheme predicts the dielectric response of insulators for trajectories
inaccessible to direct ab-initio simulation. The scheme is non-perturbative and
can capture the response of a mutating chemical environment. We demonstrate the
approach by calculating the infrared spectra of liquid water at standard
conditions, and of ice under extreme pressure, when it transforms from a

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Heat conduction in dielectric crystals originates from the propagation of
atomic vibrations, whose microscopic dynamics is well described by the
linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Recently, it was shown that
thermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a closed form as a sum over
relaxons, $\mathit{i.e.}$ collective phonon excitations that are the
eigenvectors of Boltzmann equation's scattering matrix [Cepellotti and Marzari,
PRX $\mathbf{6}$ (2016)]. Relaxons have a well-defined parity, and only odd
relaxons contribute to the thermal conductivity. Here, we show that the
complementary set of even relaxons determines another quantity --- the thermal
viscosity --- that enters into the description of heat transport, and is
especially relevant in the hydrodynamic regime, where dissipation of crystal
momentum by Umklapp scattering phases out. We also show how the thermal
conductivity and viscosity parametrize two novel viscous heat equations --- two
coupled equations for the temperature and drift-velocity fields --- which
represent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations of
hydrodynamics in the linear, laminar regime. These viscous heat equations are
derived from a coarse-graining of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation
for phonons, and encompass both limits of Fourier's law and of second sound,
taking place, respectively, in the regimes of strong or weak momentum
dissipation. Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation number as a descriptor
that captures the deviations from Fourier's law due to hydrodynamic effects. We
showcase these findings in a test case of a complex-shaped device made of
graphite, obtaining a remarkable agreement with the very recent experimental
demonstration of hydrodynamic transport in this material. The present findings
also suggest that hydrodynamic behavior can appear at room temperature in
micrometer-sized diamond crystals.</p>

energies and forces far surpassing that of classical IAPs, as well as
predicting properties such as elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves.

    <p>The recently proposed crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN)
offers a highly versatile and accurate machine learning (ML) framework by
learning material properties directly from graph-like representations of
crystal structures ("crystal graphs"). Here, we develop an improved variant of

information of the Voronoi tessellated crystal structure, explicit 3-body
correlations of neighboring constituent atoms, and an optimized chemical
representation of interatomic bonds in the crystal graphs. We demonstrate the
accuracy of the improved framework in two distinct illustrations: First, when
trained/validated on 180,000/20,000 density functional theory (DFT) calculated
thermodynamic stability entries taken from the Open Quantum Materials Database
(OQMD) and evaluated on a separate test set of 230,000 entries, iCGCNN achieves
a predictive accuracy that is significantly improved, i.e., 20% higher than
that of the original CGCNN. Second, when used to assist high-throughput search
for materials in the ThCr2Si2 structure-type, iCGCNN exhibited a success rate
of 31% which is 310 times higher than an undirected high-throughput search and
2.4 times higher than that of the original CGCNN. Using both CGCNN and iCGCNN,
we screened 132,600 compounds with elemental decorations of the ThCr2Si2
prototype crystal structure and identified a total of 97 new unique stable
compounds by performing 757 DFT calculations, accelerating the computational
time of the high-throughput search by a factor of 130. Our results suggest that
the iCGCNN can be used to accelerate high-throughput discoveries of new

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We introduce Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets), an end-to-end framework that combines deep learning with reasoning for solving complex tasks, typically in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised setting. DRNets exploit problem structure and prior knowledge by tightly combining logic and constraint reasoning with stochastic-gradient-based neural network optimization. We illustrate the power of DRNets on de-mixing overlapping hand-written Sudokus (Multi-MNIST-Sudoku) and on a substantially more complex task in scientific discovery that concerns inferring crystal structures of materials from X-ray diffraction data under thermodynamic rules (Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping). At a high level, DRNets encode a structured latent space of the input data, which is constrained to adhere to prior knowledge by a reasoning module. The structured latent encoding is used by a generative decoder to generate the targeted output. Finally, an overall objective combines responses from the generative decoder (thinking fast) and the reasoning module (thinking slow), which is optimized using constraint-aware stochastic gradient descent. We show how to encode different tasks as DRNets and demonstrate DRNets' effectiveness with detailed experiments: DRNets significantly outperform the state of the art and experts' capabilities on Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping, recovering more precise and physically meaningful crystal structures. On Multi-MNIST-Sudoku, DRNets perfectly recovered the mixed Sudokus' digits, with 100% digit accuracy, outperforming the supervised state-of-the-art MNIST de-mixing models. Finally, as a proof of concept, we also show how DRNets can solve standard combinatorial problems -- 9-by-9 Sudoku puzzles and Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT), outperforming other specialized deep learning models. DRNets are general and can be adapted and expanded to tackle other tasks.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Serial crystallography is the field of science that studies the structure and properties of crystals via diffraction patterns. In this paper, we introduce a new serial crystallography dataset comprised of real and synthetic images; the synthetic images are generated through the use of a simulator that is both scalable and accurate. The resulting dataset is called DiffraNet, and it is composed of 25,457 512x512 grayscale labeled images. We explore several computer vision approaches for classification on DiffraNet such as standard feature extraction algorithms associated with Random Forests and Support Vector Machines but also an end-to-end CNN topology dubbed DeepFreak tailored to work on this new dataset. All implementations are publicly available and have been fine-tuned using off-the-shelf AutoML optimization tools for a fair comparison. Our best model achieves 98.5% accuracy on synthetic images and 94.51% accuracy on real images. We believe that the DiffraNet dataset and its classification methods will have in the long term a positive impact in accelerating discoveries in many disciplines, including chemistry, geology, biology, materials science, metallurgy, and physics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Here we present four independent advances which facilitate the computation of
phonons and their interactions from first-principles. First, we implement a
group-theoretical approach to construct the order N Taylor series of a
d-dimensional crystal purely in terms of space group irreducible derivatives
(ID), which guarantees symmetry by construction and allows for a practical
means of communicating and storing phonons and their interactions. Second, we
prove that the smallest possible supercell which accommodates N given
wavevectors in a d-dimensional crystal is determined using the Smith Normal
Form of the matrix formed from the corresponding wavevectors; resulting in
negligible computational cost to find said supercell, in addition to providing
the maximum required multiplicity for uniform supercells at arbitrary N and d.
Third, we develop a series of finite displacement methodologies to compute
phonons and their interactions which exploit the first two developments: lone
and bundled irreducible derivative (LID and BID) approaches. LID computes a
single ID, or as few as possible, at a time in the smallest supercell possible,
while BID exploits perturbative derivatives for some order less than N (e.g.
Hellman-Feynman forces) in order to extract all ID in the smallest possible
supercells using the fewest possible computations. Finally, we derive an
equation for the order N-2 volume derivatives of the phonons in terms of the
order N ID. Given that the former are easily computed, they can be used as a
stringent, infinite ranged test of the ID. Our general framework is illustrated
on graphene, yielding irreducible phonon interactions to fifth order.
Additionally, we provide a cost analysis for the rock-salt structure at N=3,
demonstrating a massive speedup compared to popular finite displacement methods
in the literature.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Trigonal selenium and tellurium crystalize in helical chain-like structures
and thus possess interesting properties such as current-induced spin
polarization, gyrotropic effects and nonlinear optical responses. By performing
systematic ab initio calculations based on density functional theory in the
generalized gradient approximation plus scissors correction, we study their
linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We find that the two materials
exhibit significant second-harmonic generation (SHG) and linear electro-optic
(LEO) effect. In particular, the SHG coefficients of tellurium are huge in the
photon energy range of 0 ~ 3 eV, with the magnitudes of SHG(xxx) being as large
as 3640 pm/V, which are about sixteen times larger than that of GaN, a widely
used NLO material. On the other hand, trigonal selenium is found to possesses
large LEO coefficients r(xxx,0) which are more than six times larger than that
of GaN.Therefore, trigonal tellurium and selenium may find valuable
applications in NLO and LEO devices such as frequency conversion,
electro-optical switch and light signal modulator.The energy positions and
shapes of the principal features in the calculated optical dielectric functions
of both materials agree rather well with the available experimental ones, and
are also analyzed in terms of the calculated band structures especially
symmetries of the involved band states and dipole transition selection rules.</p>

    <p>Control of the crystallization process at the microscopic level makes it
possible to generate the nanocrystalline samples with the desired structural
and morphological properties, that is of great importance for modern industry.
In the present work, we study the influence of supercooling on the structure
and morphology of the crystalline nuclei arising and growing within a liquid
metallic film. The cluster analysis allows us to compute the diffraction
patterns and to evaluate the morphological characteristics (the linear sizes of
the homogeneous part and the thickness of the surface layer) of the crystalline
nuclei emergent in the system at different levels of supercooling. We find that
the liquid metallic film at the temperatures corresponded to low supercooling
levels crystallizes into a monocrystal, whereas a polycrystalline structure
forms at deep supercooling levels. We find that the temperature dependence of
critical size of the crystalline nuclei contains two distinguishable regimes
with the crossover temperature $T/T_{g}\approx1.15$ ($T_{g}$ is the glass
transition temperature), which appears due to the specific geometry of the
system.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Accurate predictions of thermo-mechanically coupled process in metals can
lead to a reduction of cost and an increase of productivity in manufacturing
processes such as forming. For modeling these coupled processes with the finite
element method, accurate descriptions of both the mechanical and the thermal
responses of the material, as well as their interaction, are needed.
Conventional material modeling employs empirical macroscopic constitutive
relations but does not account for the actual thermo-mechanical mechanisms
occurring at the microscopic level. However, the consideration of the latter
might be crucial to obtain accurate predictions and a complete understanding of
the underlying physics. In this work we describe a fully coupled implicit
thermo-mechanical framework for crystal plasticity simulations. This framework
includes thermal strains, temperature dependency of the crystal behavior and
heat generation by dissipation due to plastic slip and allows the use of large
deformation steps thanks to the implicit integration of the governing
equations. Its use within computational homogenization simulations allows to
bridge the plastic deformation and temperature gradients at the macroscopic
scale with the microscopic slip at the grain scale. A series of numerical
examples are presented to validate the approach.</p>

    <p>We propose a systematic method to generate a complete orthonormal basis set
of multipole expansion for magnetic structures in arbitrary crystal structure.
The key idea is the introduction of a virtual atomic cluster of a target
crystal, on which we can clearly define the magnetic configurations
corresponding to symmetry-adapted multipole moments. The magnetic
configurations are then mapped onto the crystal so as to preserve the magnetic
point group of the multipole moments, leading to the magnetic structures
classified according to the irreducible representations of crystallographic
point group. We apply the present scheme to pyrhochlore and hexagonal ABO3
crystal structures, and demonstrate that the multipole expansion is useful to
investigate the macroscopic responses of antiferromagnets.</p>

    <p>The work function is a fundamental electronic property of a solid that varies
with the facets of a crystalline surface. It is a crucial parameter in
spectroscopy as well as materials design, especially for technologies such as
thermionic electron guns and Schottky barriers. In this work, we present the
largest database of calculated work functions for elemental crystals to date.
This database contains the anisotropic work functions of more than 100
polymorphs of about 72 elements and up to a maximum Miller index of two and
three for non-cubic and cubic crystals, respectively. The database has been
rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data where
available. We also propose a weighted work function based on the Wulff shape
that can be compared to measurements from polycrystalline specimens, and show
that this weighted work function can be modeled empirically using simple atomic
parameters. Furthermore, for the first time, we were able to analyze simple
bond breaking rules for metallic systems beyond a maximum Miller index of one,
allowing for a more generalized investigation of work function anisotropy.</p>

    <p>We present the first full-potential method that solves the fully relativistic
4-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham equation for materials in the solid state within
the framework of atom-centered Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs). Our GTO-based
method treats one-, two-, and three-dimensional periodic systems on an equal
footing, and allows for a seamless transition to the methodology commonly used
in studies of molecules with heavy elements. The scalar relativistic effects
and spin-orbit interaction are handled variationally. The full description of
the electron-nuclear potential in the core region of heavy nuclei is
straightforward due to the local nature of the GTOs and does not pose any
computational difficulties. We show how the time-reversal symmetry and a
quaternion algebra-based formalism can be exploited to significantly reduce the
increased methodological complexity and computational cost associated with
multiple wave-function components coupled by the spin-orbit interaction. We
provide a description of how to employ the matrix form of the multipole
expansion and an iterative renormalization procedure to evaluate the
conditionally convergent lattice sums arising for periodic systems. We
investigate the problem of inverse variational collapse that arises if the
Dirac operator containing a repulsive periodic potential is expressed in a
basis containing diffuse functions, and suggest a possible solution. We
demonstrate the validity of the method on silver halide crystals with large
relativistic effects, and two-dimensional honeycomb structures (silicene and
germanene) exhibiting the spin-orbit-driven quantum spin Hall effect. Our
results are well-converged with respect to the basis limit using standard bases
developed for molecular calculations, and indicate that the rule of removing
basis functions with small exponents should not be applied when transferring
the molecular basis to solids.</p>

    <p>Many rotational invariants for crystal structure representations have been
used to describe the structure-property relationship by machine learning. The
machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) is one of the applications of
rotational invariants, which provides the relationship between the energy and
the crystal structure. Since the MLIP requires the highest accuracy among
machine learning estimations of the structure-property relationship, the
enumeration of rotational invariants is useful for constructing MLIPs with the
desired accuracy. In this study, we introduce high-order linearly independent
rotational invariants up to the sixth order based on spherical harmonics and
apply them to linearized MLIPs for elemental aluminum. A set of rotational
invariants is derived by the general process of reducing the Kronecker products
of irreducible representations (Irreps) for the SO(3) group using a
group-theoretical projector method. A high predictive power for a wide range of
structures is accomplished by using high-order invariants with low-order
invariants equivalent to pair and angular structural features.</p>

(2019) to tackle general 3-dimensional (3D) problems with arbitrary material
and geometric nonlinearities. It discovers a new way of describing multiscale

building blocks. The data-driven framework of DMN is discussed in detail about
the offline training and online extrapolation stages. Analytical solutions of
the 3D building block with a two-layer structure in both small- and
finite-strain formulations are derived based on interfacial equilibrium
conditions and kinematic constraints. With linear elastic data generated by
direct numerical simulations on a representative volume element (RVE), the
network can be effectively trained in the offline stage using stochastic
gradient descent and advanced model compression algorithms. Efficiency and
accuracy of DMN on addressing the long-standing 3D RVE challenges with complex
morphologies and material laws are validated through numerical experiments,
including 1) hyperelastic particle-reinforced rubber composite with Mullins
effect; 2) polycrystalline materials with rate-dependent crystal plasticity; 3)
carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with fiber anisotropic
elasticity and matrix plasticity. In particular, we demonstrate a three-scale
homogenization procedure of CFRP system by concatenating the microscale and
mesoscale material networks. The complete learning and extrapolation procedures

    <p>Graph networks are a new machine learning (ML) paradigm that supports both

universal MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models for accurate property
prediction in both molecules and crystals. We demonstrate that the MEGNet

$\sim 60,000$ crystals in the Materials Project substantially outperform prior
ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band gaps and elastic
moduli of crystals, achieving better than DFT accuracy over a much larger data
set. We present two new strategies to address data limitations common in
materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically-intuitive
approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy
at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy into a single free
energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure and entropy as
global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings in
MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned from
a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to improve
property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli).</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>When an ice crystal is born from liquid water two key changes occur: (i) the
molecules order; and (ii) the mobility of the molecules drops as they adopt
their lattice positions. Most research on ice nucleation (and crystallization
in general) has focused on understanding the former with less attention paid to
the latter. However, supercooled water exhibits fascinating and complex
dynamical behavior, most notably dynamical heterogeneity (DH), a phenomenon
where spatially separated domains of relatively mobile and immobile particles
coexist. Strikingly, the microscopic connection between the DH of water and the
nucleation of ice has yet to be unraveled directly at the molecular level. Here
we tackle this issue via computer simulations which reveal that: (i) ice
nucleation occurs in low-mobility regions of the liquid; (ii) there is a
dynamical incubation period in which the mobility of the molecules drops prior
to any ice-like ordering; and (iii) ice-like clusters cause arrested dynamics
in surrounding water molecules. With this we establish a clear connection
between dynamics and nucleation. We anticipate that our findings will pave the
way for the examination of the role of dynamical heterogeneities in
heterogeneous and solution-based nucleation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The efficient extraction of force constants (FCs) is crucial for the analysis
of many thermodynamic materials properties. Approaches based on the systematic
enumeration of finite differences scale poorly with system size and can rarely
extend beyond third order when input data is obtained from first-principles
calculations. Methods based on parameter fitting in the spirit of interatomic
potentials, on the other hand, can extract FC parameters from semi-random
configurations of high information density and advanced regularized regression
methods can recover physical solutions from a limited amount of data. Here, we
present the hiPhive Python package, that enables the construction of force
constant models up to arbitrary order. hiPhive exploits crystal symmetries to
reduce the number of free parameters and then employs advanced machine learning
algorithms to extract the force constants. Depending on the problem at hand
both over and underdetermined systems are handled efficiently. The FCs can be
subsequently analyzed directly and or be used to carry out e.g., molecular
dynamics simulations. The utility of this approach is demonstrated via several
examples including ideal and defective monolayers of MoS$_2$ as well as bulk
nickel.</p>

    <p>A computational method is developed for the study of mechanical response and
fracture behavior of phase field crystals (PFC), to overcome a limitation of
the PFC dynamics which lacks an effective mechanism for describing fast
mechanical relaxation of the material system. The method is based on a simple
interpolation scheme for PFC (IPFC) making use of a condition of the
displacement field to satisfy local elastic equilibration, while preserving key
characteristics of the original PFC model. We conduct a systematic study on the
mechanical properties of a sample nanoribbon system with honeycomb lattice
symmetry subjected to uniaxial tension, for numerical validation of the IPFC
scheme and the comparison with the original PFC and modified PFC methods.
Results of mechanical response, in both elasticity and fracture regimes, show
the advantage and efficiency of the IPFC method across different system sizes
and applied strain rates, due to its effective process of mechanical
equilibration. A brittle fracture behavior is obtained in IPFC calculations,
where effects of system temperature and chirality on the fracture strength and
Young's modulus are also identified, with results agreeing with those found in
previous atomistic simulations of graphene. The IPFC scheme developed here is
generic and applicable to the mechanical studies using different types of PFC
free energy functionals designed for various material systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Developing accurate, transferable and computationally inexpensive machine
learning models can rapidly accelerate the discovery and development of new
materials. Some of the major challenges involved in developing such models are,
(i) limited availability of materials data as compared to other fields, (ii)
lack of universal descriptor of materials to predict its various properties.
The limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer
learning, while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and
Grossman [1], where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network
(CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals. In this work, we
develop a new model (MT-CGCNN) by integrating CGCNN with transfer learning
based on multi-task (MT) learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-CGCNN
by simultaneous prediction of various material properties such as Formation
Energy, Band Gap and Fermi Energy for a wide range of inorganic crystals (46774
materials). MT-CGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on
correlated properties by upto 8%. The model prediction has lower test error
compared to CGCNN, even when the training data is reduced by 10%. We also
demonstrate our model's better performance through prediction of end user
scenario related to metal/non-metal classification. These results encourage
further development of machine learning approaches which leverage multi-task
learning to address the aforementioned challenges in the discovery of new
materials. We make MT-CGCNN's source code available to encourage reproducible
research.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Studying the crystallization process of silicon is a challenging task since
empirical potentials are not able to reproduce well the properties of both
semiconducting solid and metallic liquid. On the other hand, nucleation is a
rare event that occurs in much longer timescales than those achievable by
ab-initio molecular dynamics. To address this problem, we train a deep neural
network potential based on a set of data generated by Metadynamics simulations
using a classical potential. We show how this is an effective way to collect
all the relevant data for the process of interest. In order to drive
efficiently the crystallization process, we introduce a new collective variable
based on the Debye structure factor. We are able to encode the long-range order
information in a local variable which is better suited to describe the
nucleation dynamics. The reference energies are then calculated using the SCAN
exchange-correlation functional, which is able to get a better description of
the bonding complexity of the Si phase diagram. Finally, we recover the free
energy surface with a DFT accuracy, and we compute the thermodynamics
properties near the melting point, obtaining a good agreement with experimental
data. In addition, we study the early stages of the crystallization process,
unveiling features of the nucleation mechanism.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Understanding the applicability and limitations of electronic-structure
methods needs careful and efficient comparison with accurate reference data.
Knowledge of the quality and errors of electronic-structure calculations is
crucial to advanced method development, high-throughput computations, and data
analyses. In this paper, we present a test set for computational materials
science and engineering (MSE), that aims to provide accurate and easily
accessible crystal properties for a hierarchy of exchange-correlation
approximations, ranging from the well-established mean-field approximations to
the state-of-the-art methods of many-body perturbation theory. We consider
cohesive energy, lattice constant and bulk modulus as representatives for the
first- and second-row elements and their binaries with cubic crystal structures
and various bonding characters. A strong effort is made to push the borders of
numerical accuracy for cohesive properties as calculated using the
local-density approximation (LDA), several generalized gradient approximations
(GGAs), meta-GGAs and hybrids in \textit{all-electron} resolution, and the
second-order M\o{}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and the random-phase
approximation (RPA) with frozen-core approximation based on
\textit{all-electron} Hartree-Fock, PBE and/or PBE0 references. This results in
over 10,000 calculations, which record a comprehensive convergence test with
respect to numerical parameters for a wide range of electronic structure
methods within the numerical atom-centered orbital framework. As an
indispensable part of the MSE test set, a web site is established
\href{http://mse.fhi-berlin.mpg.de}{\texttt{http://mse.fhi-berlin.mpg.de}}.
This not only allows for easy access to all reference data but also provides
user-friendly graphical tools for post-processing error analysis.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We study thermal processes in infinite harmonic crystals having a unit cell
with arbitrary number of particles. Initially particles have zero displacements
and random velocities, corresponding to some initial temperature profile. Our
main goal is to calculate spatial distribution of kinetic temperatures,
corresponding to degrees of freedom of the unit cell, at any moment in time. An
approximate expression for the temperatures is derived from solution of lattice
dynamics equations. It is shown that the temperatures are represented as a sum
of two terms. The first term describes high-frequency oscillations of the
temperatures caused by local transition to thermal equilibrium at short times.
The second term describes slow changes of the temperature profile caused by
ballistic heat transport. It is shown, in particular, that local values of
temperatures, corresponding to degrees of freedom of the unit cell, are
generally different even if their initial values are equal. Analytical findings
are supported by results of numerical solution of lattice dynamics equations
for diatomic chain and graphene lattice. Presented theory may serve for
description of unsteady ballistic heat transport in real crystals with low
concentration of defects. In particular, solution of the problem with
sinusoidal temperature profile can be used for proper interpretation of
experimental data obtained by the transient thermal grating technique.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We study transient thermal processes in infinite harmonic crystals with
complex (polyatomic) lattice. Initially particles have zero displacements and
random velocities such that distribution of temperature is spatially uniform.
Initial kinetic and potential energies are different and therefore the system
is far from thermal equilibrium. Time evolution of kinetic temperatures,
corresponding to different degrees of freedom of the unit cell, is
investigated. It is shown that the temperatures oscillate in time and tend to
generally different equilibrium values. The oscillations are caused by two
physical processes: equilibration of kinetic and potential energies and
redistribution of temperature among degrees of freedom of the unit cell. An
exact formula describing these oscillations is obtained. At large times, a
crystal approaches thermal equilibrium, i.e. a state in which the temperatures
are constant in time. A relation between equilibrium values of the temperatures
and initial conditions is derived. This relation is refereed to as the
non-equipartition theorem. For illustration, transient thermal processes in a
diatomic chain and graphene lattice are considered. Analytical results are
supported by numerical solution of lattice dynamics equations.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The combination of high throughput computation and machine learning has led
to a new paradigm in materials design by allowing for the direct screening of
vast portions of structural, chemical, and property space. The use of these
powerful techniques leads to the generation of enormous amounts of data, which
in turn calls for new techniques to efficiently explore and visualize the
materials space to help identify underlying patterns. In this work, we develop
a unified framework to hierarchically visualize the compositional and
structural similarities between materials in an arbitrary material space with
representations learned from different layers of graph convolutional neural
networks. We demonstrate the potential for such a visualization approach by
showing that patterns emerge automatically that reflect similarities at
different scales in three representative classes of materials: perovskites,
elemental boron, and general inorganic crystals, covering material spaces of
different compositions, structures, and both. For perovskites, elemental
similarities are learned that reflects multiple aspects of atom properties. For
elemental boron, structural motifs emerge automatically showing characteristic
boron local environments. For inorganic crystals, the similarity and stability
of local coordination environments are shown combining different center and
neighbor atoms. The method could help transition to a data-centered exploration
of materials space in automated materials design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Multivariate statistical methods are widely used throughout the sciences,
including microscopy, however, their utilisation for analysis of electron
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data has not been adequately explored. The basic
aim of most EBSD analysis is to segment the spatial domain to reveal and
quantify the microstructure, and links this to knowledge of the crystallography
(eg crystal phase, orientation) within each segmented region. Two analysis
strategies have been explored; principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means
clustering. The intensity at individual (binned) pixels on the detector were
used as the variables defining the multidimensional space in which each pattern
in the map generates a single discrete point. PCA analysis alone did not work
well but rotating factors to the VARIMAX solution did. K-means clustering also
successfully segmented the data but was computational more expensive. The
characteristic patterns produced by either VARIMAX or k-means clustering
enhance weak patterns, remove pattern overlap, and allow subtle effects from
polarity to be distinguished. Combining multivariate statistical analysis (MSA)
approaches with template matching to simulation libraries can significantly
reduce computational demand as the number of patterns to be matched is
drastically reduced. Both template matching and MSA approaches may augment
existing analysis methods but will not replace them in the majority of
applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A complete knowledge of absolute surface energies with any arbitrary crystal
orientation is important for the improvements of semiconductor devices because
it determines the equilibrium and nonequilibrium crystal shapes of thin films
and nanostructures. It is also crucial in the control of thin film crystal
growth and surface effect studies in broad research fields. However, obtaining
accurate absolute formation energies is still a huge challenge for the
semi-polar surfaces of compound semiconductors. It mainly results from the
asymmetry nature of crystal structures and the complicated step morphologies
and related reconstructions of these surface configurations. Here we propose a
general approach to calculate the absolute formation energies of wurtzite
semi-polar surfaces by first-principles calculations, taking GaN as an example.
We mainly focused on two commonly seen sets of semi-polar surfaces: a-family
(11-2X) and m-family (10-1X). For all the semi-polar surfaces that we have
calculated in this paper, the self-consistent accuracy is within 1.5
meV/{\AA}^2. Our work fills the last technical gap to fully investigate and
understand the shape and morphology of compound semiconductors.</p>

    <p>Wannier tight-binding models are effective models constructed from
first-principles calculations. As such, they bridge a gap between the accuracy
of first-principles calculations and the computational simplicity of effective
models. In this work, we extend the existing methodology of creating Wannier
tight-binding models from first-principles calculations by introducing the
symmetrization post-processing step, which enables the production of
Wannier-like models that respect the symmetries of the considered crystal.
Furthermore, we implement automatic workflows, which allow for producing a
large number of tight-binding models for large classes of chemically and
structurally similar compounds, or materials subject to external influence such
as strain. As a particular illustration, these workflows are applied to
strained III-V semiconductor materials. These results can be used for further
study of topological phase transitions in III-V quantum wells.</p>

    <p>The full elasticity tensor for nano-crystalline copper is derived in
molecular simulations by performing numerical tests for a set of generated

to the anisotropy degree of the overall stiffness tensor resulting from the
limited number of grain orientations and their spatial distribution. The
dependence of the overall bulk and shear moduli of an isotropized polycrystal
on the average grain diameter is analysed. It is found that while the shear
modulus decreases with grain size, the bulk modulus shows negligible dependence
on the grain diameter and is close to the bulk modulus of a single crystal. A
closed-form mean-field model of effective elastic properties for a bulk
nano-grained polycrystal with cubic grains, i.e. made of a material with cubic
symmetry, is formulated. In the model all parameters are based on the data for
a single crystal and on the averaged grain size without any need for additional
fitting. It is shown that the proposed model provides predictions of
satisfactory qualitative and quantitative agreement with atomistic simulations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is a technique used to measure
crystallographic features in the scanning electron microscope. The technique is
highly automated and readily accessible in many laboratories. EBSD pattern
indexing is conventionally performed with raw electron backscatter patterns
(EBSPs). These patterns are software processed to locate the band centres (and
sometimes edges) from which the crystallographic index of each band is
determined. Once a consistent index for many bands are obtained, the crystal
orientation with respect to a reference sample & detector orientation can be
determined and presented. Unfortunately, due to challenges related to crystal
symmetry, there are limited available pattern indexing approaches and this has
likely hampered open development of the technique. In this manuscript, we
present a new method of pattern indexing, based upon a method with which
satellites locate themselves in the night sky, and systematically demonstrate
its effectiveness using dynamical simulations and real experimental patterns.
The benefit of releasing this new algorithm is demonstrated as we utilise this
indexing process, together with dynamical solutions, to provide some of the
first accuracy assessments of an indexing solution. In disclosing a new
indexing algorithm, and software processing tool-kit, we hope this opens up
EBSD developments to more users. The software code and example data is released
alongside this article for 3rd party developments.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Ionic liquids constrained at interfaces or restricted in subnanometric pores
are increasingly employed in modern technologies, including energy
applications. Understanding the details of their behavior in these conditions
is therefore critical. By using molecular dynamics simulation, we clarify
theoretically and numerically the effect of confinement at the nanoscale on the
static and dynamic properties of an ionic liquid. In particular, we focus on
the interplay among the size of the ions, the slit pore width, and the length
scale associated to the long-range organization of polar and apolar domains
present in the bulk material. By modulating both the temperature and the extent
of the confinement, we demonstrate the existence of a complex reentrant phase
behavior, including isotropic liquid and liquid-crystal-like phases with
different symmetries. We show how these changes impact the relative
organization of the ions, with substantial modifications of the Coulombic
ordering, and their dynamical state. In this respect, we reveal a remarkable
decoupling of the dynamics of the counterions, pointing to very different roles
played by these in charge transport under confinement. We finally discuss our
findings in connection with very recent experimental and theoretical work.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We adopted and extended an efficient Gr\"uneisen formalism to study the
phonon anharmonicity and linear thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of
trigonal bismuth selenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$) and antimony telluride (Sb$_2$Te$_3$).
Anharmonicity of the systems is studied via extensive calculation of
Gr\"uneisen parameters that exploit symmetry-preserving deformations.
Consistent with experimental findings, a large anisotropy between the TECs in
the $a$ and $c$ directions is found. The larger anharmonicity inherent in
Sb$_2$Te$_3$, as compared to Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is offset by the volumetric effect,
resulting in comparable temperature dependence of their linear TECs. The Debye
temperatures deduced from our first-principles data also agree very well with
the existing tabulated values. The highly efficient methodology developed in
this work, applied for the first time to study the linear TECs of two trigonal
thermoelectric systems, opens up exciting opportunities to address the
anharmonic effects in other thermoelectrics and other low-symmetry materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Polymorphic solids of the same chemical composition can have different atomic
structures; in each polymorph atoms vibrate around a local potential energy
minimum (LPEM). If transformations to other structures have sufficiently high
enthalpy barriers, then each polymorph is either stable or metastable; it is
stationary and does not spontaneously change with time. But what happens, if
those barriers are low? As examples, we consider NiTi shape memory alloy
exhibiting a large elastocaloric effect, and selected elemental solids. We
suggest a model for dynamically polymorphic solids, where multiple LPEMs are
visited by ergodic motion of a single atom. We predict that upon cooling a
dynamically polymorphic phase should undergo a symmetry-breaking first-order
phase transition, accompanied by a finite change of the lattice entropy. We
discuss 3 methods used to calculate phonons in solids with non-harmonic dimpled
atomic potentials, and compare theoretical predictions to experiment.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present Genarris, a Python package that performs configuration space
screening for molecular crystals of rigid molecules by random sampling with
physical constraints. For fast energy evaluations Genarris employs a Harris
approximation, whereby the total density of a molecular crystal is constructed
via superposition of single molecule densities. Dispersion-inclusive density
functional theory (DFT) is then used for the Harris density without performing
a self-consistency cycle. Genarris uses machine learning for clustering, based
on a relative coordinate descriptor (RCD) developed specifically for molecular
crystals, which is shown to be robust in identifying packing motif similarity.
In addition to random structure generation, Genarris offers three workflows
based on different sequences of successive clustering and selection steps: the
"Rigorous" workflow is an exhaustive exploration of the potential energy
landscape, the "Energy" workflow produces a set of low energy structures, and
the "Diverse" workflow produces a maximally diverse set of structures. The
latter is recommended for generating initial populations for genetic
algorithms. Here, the implementation of Genarris is reported and its
application is demonstrated for three test cases.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We describe strategies to estimate the upper limits of the efficiency of
photon energy harvesting via hot electron extraction from gapless absorbers.
Gapless materials such as noble metals can be used for harvesting the whole
solar spectrum, including visible and near-infrared light. The energy of
photo-generated non-equilibrium or hot charge carriers can be harvested before
they thermalize with the crystal lattice via the process of their internal
photo-emission (IPE) through the rectifying Schottky junction with a
semiconductor. However, the low efficiency and the high cost of noble metals
necessitates the search for cheaper abundant alternative materials, and we show
here that carbon can serve as a promising IPE material candidate. We compare
the upper limits of performance of IPE photon energy-harvesting platforms,
which incorporate either gold or carbon as the photoactive material where hot
electrons are generated. Through a combination of density functional theory,
joint electron density of states calculations, and Schottky diode efficiency
modeling, we show that the material electron band structure imposes a strict
upper limit on the achievable efficiency of the IPE devices. Our calculations
reveal that graphite is a good material candidate for the IPE absorber for
harvesting visible and near-infrared photons. Graphite electron density of
states yields a sizeable population of hot electrons with energies high enough
to be collected across the potential barrier. We also discuss the mechanisms
that prevent the IPE device efficiency from reaching the upper limits imposed
by their material electron band structures. The proposed approach is general
and allows for efficient pre-screening of materials for their potential use in
IPE energy converters and photodetectors within application-specific spectral
windows.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Interaction in a flat band is magnified due to the divergence in the density
of states, which gives rise to a variety of many-body phenomena such as
ferromagnetism and Wigner crystallization. Until now, however, most studies of
the flat band physics are based on model systems, making their experimental
realization a distant future. Here, we propose a class of systems made of real
atoms, namely, carbon atoms with realistic physical interactions (dubbed here
as Kagome graphene/graphyne). Density functional theory calculations reveal
that these Kagome lattices offer a controllable way to realize robust flat
bands sufficiently close to the Fermi level. Upon hole doping, they split into
spin-polarized bands at different energies to result in a flat-band
ferromagnetism. At a half filling, this splitting reaches its highest level of
768 meV. At smaller fillings, e.g., when {\nu}=1/6, on the other hand, a Wigner
crystal spontaneously forms, where the electrons form closed loops localized on
the grid points of a regular triangular lattice. It breaks the translational
symmetry of the original Kagome lattice. We further show that the Kagome
lattices exhibit good mechanical stabilities, based on which a possible route
for experimental realization of the Kagome graphene is also proposed.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A fundamental challenge in materials design is linking building block
attributes to crystal structure. Addressing this challenge is particularly
difficult for systems that exhibit emergent order, such as entropy-stabilized
colloidal crystals. We combine recently developed techniques in inverse design
with machine learning to construct a model that correctly classifies the
crystals of more than ten thousand polyhedral shapes into 13 different
structures with a predictive accuracy of 96% using only two geometric shape
measures. With three measures, 98% accuracy is achieved. We test our model on
previously reported colloidal crystal structures for 71 symmetric polyhedra and
obtain 92% accuracy. Our findings (1) demonstrate that entropic colloidal
crystals are controlled by surprisingly few parameters, (2) provide a
quantitative model to predict these crystals solely from the geometry of their
building blocks, and (3) suggest a prediction paradigm that easily generalizes
to other self-assembled materials.</p>

    <p>The c2x code fills two distinct roles. Its first role is as a converter
between the binary format .check files from the Castep electronic structure
code and various visualisation programs. Its second role is to manipulate and
analyse the input and output files from a variety of electronic structure
codes, including Castep, Onetep and Vasp, as well as the widely-used `Gaussian
cube' file format. Analysis includes symmetry analysis, and arbitrary cell
transformations. It continues to be under development, with growing
functionality, and is written in a form which would make it easy to extend it
to working directly with files from other electronic structure codes. Data
which c2x is capable of extracting from Castep's binary checkpoint files
include charge densities, spin densities, wavefunctions, relaxed atomic
positions, forces, the Fermi level, the total energy, and symmetry operations.
It can recreate .cell input files from checkpoint files. Volumetric data can be
output in formats usable by many common visualisation programs, and c2x will
itself calculate integrals, expand data into supercells, and interpolate data
via combinations of Fourier and trilinear interpolation. It can extract data
along arbitrary lines (such as between atoms) as 1D output. C2x is able to
convert between several common formats for describing molecules and crystals,
including the .cell format of Castep. It can construct supercells, reduce cells
to their primitive form, and add specified k-point meshes. It uses the spglib
library to report symmetry information, which it can add to .cell files. C2x is
a command-line utility, so is readily included in scripts. It is available
under the GPL and can be obtained from http://www.c2x.org.uk. It is believed to
be the only open-source code which can read Castep's .check files, so it will
have utility in other projects.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Digital image correlation (DIC) is a well-established, non-invasive technique
for tracking and quantifying the deformation of mechanical samples under
strain. While it provides an obvious way to observe incremental and aggregate
displacement information, it seems likely that DIC data sets, which after all
reflect the spatially-resolved response of a microstructure to loads, contain
much richer information than has generally been extracted from them. In this
paper, we demonstrate a machine-learning approach to quantifying the prior
deformation history of a crystalline sample based on its response to a
subsequent DIC test. This prior deformation history is encoded in the
microstructure through the inhomogeneity of the dislocation microstructure, and
in the spatial correlations of the dislocation patterns, which mediate the
system's response to the DIC test load. Our domain consists of deformed
crystalline thin films generated by a discrete dislocation plasticity
simulation. We explore the range of applicability of machine learning (ML) for
typical experimental protocols, and as a function of possible size effects and
stochasticity. Plasticity size effects may directly influence the data,
rendering unsupervised techniques unable to distinguish different plasticity
regimes.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a generalization of the maximum entropy method to the analytic
continuation of matrix-valued Green's functions. To treat off-diagonal elements
correctly based on Bayesian probability theory, the entropy term has to be
extended for spectral functions that are possibly negative in some frequency
ranges. In that way, all matrix elements of the Green's function matrix can be
analytically continued; we introduce a computationally cheap element-wise
method for this purpose. However, this method cannot ensure important
constraints on the mathematical properties of the resulting spectral functions,
namely positive semidefiniteness and Hermiticity. To improve on this, we
present a full matrix formalism, where all matrix elements are treated
simultaneously. We show the capabilities of these methods using insulating and
metallic dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) Green's functions as test cases.
Finally, we apply the methods to realistic material calculations for LaTiO$_3$,
where off-diagonal matrix elements in the Green's function appear due to the
distorted crystal structure.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Phonon-mediated thermal conductivity, which is of great technological
relevance, fundamentally arises due to anharmonic scattering from interatomic
potentials. Despite its prevalence, accurate first-principles calculations of
thermal conductivity remain challenging, primarily due to the high
computational cost of anharmonic interatomic force constant (IFCs)
calculations. Meanwhile, the related anharmonic phenomenon of thermal expansion
is much more tractable, being computable from the Gr\"uneisen parameters
associated with phonon frequency shifts due to crystal deformations. In this
work, we propose a novel approach for computing the largest cubic IFCs from the
Gr\"uneisen parameter data. This allows an approximate determination of the
thermal conductivity via a much less expensive route. The key insight is that
although the Gr\"uneisen parameters cannot possibly contain all the information
on the cubic IFCs, being derivable from spatially uniform deformations, they
can still unambiguously and accurately determine the largest and most
physically relevant ones. By fitting the anisotropic Gr\"uneisen parameter data
along judiciously designed deformations, we can deduce (i.e., reverse engineer)
the dominant cubic IFCs and estimate three-phonon scattering amplitudes. We
illustrate our approach by explicitly computing the largest cubic IFCs and
thermal conductivity of graphene, especially for its out-of-plane (flexural)
modes that exhibit anomalously large anharmonic shifts and thermal conductivity
contributions. Our calculations on graphene not only exhibits reasonable
agreement with established DFT results, but also presents a pedagogical
opportunity for introducing an elegant analytic treatment of the Gr\"uneisen
parameters of generic two-band models. Our approach can be readily extended to
more complicated crystalline materials with nontrivial anharmonic lattice
effects.</p>

exhibit a combination of metallic and ceramic features. These properties are

alternating strong M-C bonds in high-density MC slabs, and relatively weak M-A
bonds between the slabs. Here, we review the trend and relationship between the

this approach by studying the case of sodium and aluminum that crystallize in
the bcc and fcc crystalline structure, respectively. Using these two generic
collective variables, we perform variationally enhanced sampling and well
tempered metadynamics simulations, and find that the systems transform
spontaneously and reversibly between the liquid and the solid phases.</p>

be significant in lowering the energy of CT states, enhancing their potential
to effectively participate in SF. In order to simulate these, it desirable to
adopt a computational approach which is acceptably accurate, relatively
inexpensive, which and scales well to larger systems, thus enabling the study
of screening effects. We propose a novel, electrostatically-corrected
constrained Density Functional Theory (cDFT) approach as a low-cost solution to
the calculation of CT energies in molecular crystals such as pentacene. Here we
consider an implementation in the context of the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT
code, but our electrostatic correction method is in principle applicable in
combination with any constrained DFT implementation, also outside the
linear-scaling framework. Our newly developed method allows us to estimate CT
energies in the infinite crystal limit, and with these to validate the accuracy
of the cluster approximation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Recent advances in theoretical structure prediction methods and
high-throughput computational techniques are revolutionizing experimental
discovery of the thermodynamically stable inorganic materials. Metastable
materials represent a new frontier for studies, since even simple binary non
ground state compounds of common elements may be awaiting discovery. However,
there are significant research challenges related to non-equilibrium thin film
synthesis and crystal structure predictions, such as small strained crystals in
the experimental samples and energy minimization based theoretical algorithms.
Here we report on experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as
theoretical first-principles calculations of a previously unreported
mixed-valent binary tin nitride. Thin film experiments indicate that this novel
material is N-deficient SnN with tin in the mixed II/IV valence state and a
small low-symmetry unit cell. Theoretical calculations suggest that the most
likely crystal structure has the space group 2 (SG2) related to the distorted
delafossite (SG166), which is nearly 0.1 eV/atom above the ground state SnN
polymorph. This observation is rationalized by the structural similarity of the
SnN distorted delafossite to the chemically related Sn3N4 spinel compound,
which provides a fresh scientific insight into the reasons for growth of
polymorphs of the metastable material. In addition to reporting on the
discovery of the simple binary SnN compound, this paper illustrates a possible
way of combining a wide range of advanced characterization techniques with the
first-principle property calculation methods, to elucidate the most likely
crystal structure of the previously unreported metastable materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Physical systems are frequently modeled as sets of points in space, each
representing the position of an atom, molecule, or mesoscale particle. As many
properties of such systems depend on the underlying ordering of their
constituent particles, understanding that structure is a primary objective of
condensed matter research. Although perfect crystals are fully described by a
set of translation and basis vectors, real-world materials are never perfect,
as thermal vibrations and defects introduce significant deviation from ideal
order. Meanwhile, liquids and glasses present yet more complexity. A complete
understanding of structure thus remains a central, open problem. Here we
propose a unified mathematical framework, based on the topology of the Voronoi
cell of a particle, for classifying local structure in ordered and disordered
systems that is powerful and practical. We explain the underlying reason why
this topological description of local structure is better suited for structural
analysis than continuous descriptions. We demonstrate the connection of this
approach to the behavior of physical systems and explore how crystalline
structure is compromised at elevated temperatures. We also illustrate potential
applications to identifying defects in plastically deformed polycrystals at
high temperatures, automating analysis of complex structures, and
characterizing general disordered systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a computer simulation study of glassy and crystalline states using
the standard Lennard-Jones interaction potential that is truncated at a finite
cut-off distance, as is typical of many computer simulations. We demonstrate
that the discontinuity at the cut-off distance in the first derivative of the
potential (corresponding to the interparticle force) leads to the appearance of
cut-off nonlinearities. These cut-off nonlinearities persist into the
very-low-temperature regime thereby affecting low-temperature thermal
vibrations, which leads to a breakdown of the harmonic approximation for many
eigen modes, particularly for low-frequency vibrational modes. Furthermore,
while expansion nonlinearities which are due to higher order terms in the
Taylor expansion of the interaction potential are usually ignored at low
temperatures and show up as the temperature increases, cut-off nonlinearities
can become most significant at the lowest temperatures. Anharmonic effects
readily show up in the elastic moduli which not only depend on the eigen
frequencies, but are crucially sensitive to the eigen vectors of the normal
modes. Whereas, those observables that rely mainly on static structural
information or just the eigen frequencies, such as the vibrational density of
states, total potential energy, and specific heat, show negligible dependence
on the presence of the cut-off. Similar aspects of nonlinear behavior have
recently been reported in model granular materials, where the constituent
particles interact through finite-range, purely-repulsive potentials. These
nonlinearities have been ascribed to the nature of the sudden cut-off at
contact in the force-law, thus we demonstrate that cut-off nonlinearities
emerge as a general feature of ordered and disordered solid state systems
interacting through truncated potentials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors are crucial
to develop low-dimensional spintronic devices. Using density functional theory,
we show that single-layer chromium trihalides (SLCTs) (CrX$_3$,X=F, Cl, Br and
I) constitute a series of stable 2D intrinsic FM semiconductors. A
free-standing SLCT can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal, due to a low
cleavage energy and a high in-plane stiffness. Electronic structure
calculations using the HSE06 functional indicate that both bulk and
single-layer CrX$_3$ are half semiconductors with indirect gaps and their
valence bands and conduction bands are fully spin-polarized in the same spin
direction. The energy gaps and absorption edges of CrBr$_3$ and CrI$_3$ are
found to be in the visible frequency range, which implies possible
opt-electronic applications. Furthermore, SLCTs are found to possess a large
magnetic moment of 3$\mu_B$ per formula unit and a sizable magnetic anisotropy
energy. The magnetic exchange constants of SLCTs are then extracted using the
Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian and the microscopic origins of the various exchange
interactions are analyzed. A competition between a near 90$^\circ$ FM
superexchange and a direct antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange results in a FM
nearest-neighbour exchange interaction. The next and third nearest-neighbour
exchange interactions are found to be FM and AFM respectively and this can be
understood by the angle-dependent extended Cr-X-X-Cr superexchange interaction.
Moreover, the Curie temperatures of SLCTs are also predicted using Monte Carlo
simulations and the values can further increase by applying a biaxial tensile
strain. The unique combination of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism, half
semiconductivity and large magnetic anisotropy energies renders the SLCTs as
promising candidates for next-generation semiconductor spintronic applications.</p>

    <p>Measuring similarities/dissimilarities between atomic structures is important
for the exploration of potential energy landscapes. However, the cell vectors
together with the coordinates of the atoms, which are generally used to
describe periodic systems, are quantities not suitable as fingerprints to
distinguish structures. Based on a characterization of the local environment of
all atoms in a cell we introduce crystal fingerprints that can be calculated
easily and allow to define configurational distances between crystalline
structures that satisfy the mathematical properties of a metric. This distance
between two configurations is a measure of their similarity/dissimilarity and
it allows in particular to distinguish structures. The new method is an useful
tool within various energy landscape exploration schemes, such as minima
hopping, random search, swarm intelligence algorithms and high-throughput

    <p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of 58 liquid elements at their
triple point show that most metals exhibit near proportionality between thermal
fluctuations between virial and potential-energy in the isochoric ensemble.
This demonstrates a general "hidden" scale invariance of metals making the
dense part of the thermodynamic phase diagram effectively one dimensional with
respect to structure and dynamics. DFT computed density scaling exponents,
related to the Gr{\"u}neisen parameter, are in good agreement with experimental
values for 16 elements where reliable data were available. Hidden scale
invariance is demonstrated in detail for magnesium by showing invariance of
structure and dynamics. Computed melting curves of period three metals follow
curves with invariance (isomorphs). The experimental structure factor of
magnesium is predicted by assuming scale invariant inverse power-law (IPL) pair
interactions. However, crystal packings of several transition metals (V, Cr,
Mn, Fe, Nb, Mo, Ta, W and Hg), most post-transition metals (Ga, In, Sn, and Tl)
and the metalloids Si and Ge cannot be explained by the IPL assumption. Thus,
hidden scale invariance can be present even when the IPL-approximation is
inadequate. The virial-energy correlation coefficient of iron and phosphorous
is shown to increase at elevated pressures. Finally, we discuss how scale
invariance explains the Gr{\"u}neisen equation of state and a number of
well-known empirical melting and freezing rules.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We report ab initio calculations of the spin splitting of the uppermost
valence band (UVB) and the lowermost conduction band (LCB) in bulk and
atomically thin GaS, GaSe, GaTe, and InSe. These layered monochalcogenides
appear in four major polytypes depending on the stacking order, except for the
monoclinic GaTe. Bulk and few-layer $\epsilon$- and $\gamma$-type, and
odd-number $\beta$-type GaS, GaSe, and InSe crystals are noncentrosymmetric.
The spin splittings of the UVB and the LCB near the $\Gamma$-point in the
Brillouin zone are finite, but still smaller than those in a zinc-blende
semiconductor such as GaAs. On the other hand, the spin splitting is zero in
centrosymmetric bulk and even-number few-layer $\beta$-type GaS, GaSe, and
InSe, owing to the constraint of spatial inversion symmetry. By contrast, GaTe
exhibits zero spin splitting because it is centrosymmetric down to a single
layer. In these monochalcogenide semiconductors, the separation of the
non-degenerate conduction and valence bands from adjacent bands results in the
suppression of Elliot-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism. Therefore, the electron-
and hole-spin relaxation times in these systems with zero or minimal spin
splittings are expected to exceed those in GaAs when the D'yakonov-Perel' spin
relaxation mechanism is also suppressed.</p>

    <p>A method is presented for generating a good initial guess of a transition
path between given initial and final states of a system without evaluation of
the energy. An objective function surface is constructed using an interpolation
of pairwise distances at each discretization point along the path and the
nudged elastic band method then used to find an optimal path on this image
dependent pair potential (IDPP) surface. This provides an initial path for the
more computationally intensive calculations of the true minimum energy path
using some method of choice for evaluating the energy and atomic forces, for
example by ab initio or density functional theory. The optimal path on the IDPP
surface is significantly closer to the true minimum energy path than a linear
interpolation of the Cartesian coordinates and, therefore, reduces the number
of iterations needed to reach convergence and averts divergence in the
electronic structure calculations when atoms are brought too close to each
other in the initial path. The method is illustrated with three examples: (1)
rotation of a methyl group in an ethane molecule, (2) an exchange of atoms in
an island on a crystal surface, and (3) an exchange of two Si-atoms in
amorphous silicon. In all three cases, the computational effort in finding the
minimum energy path with DFT was reduced by a factor ranging from 50 % to an
order of magnitude by using an IDPP path as the initial path. The time required
for parallel computations was reduced even more because of load imbalance when
linear interpolation of Cartesian coordinates was used.</p>

    <p>We theoretically investigate the generation of ultrafast currents in
insulators induced by strong few-cycle laser pulses. Ab initio simulations
based on time-dependent density functional theory give insight into the
atomic-scale properties of the induced current signifying a femtosecond-scale
insulator-metal transition. We observe the transition from nonlinear
polarization currents during the laser pulse at low intensities to
tunnelinglike excitation into the conduction band at higher laser intensities.
At high intensities, the current persists after the conclusion of the laser
pulse considered to be the precursor of the dielectric breakdown on the
femtosecond scale. We show that the transferred charge sensitively depends on
the orientation of the polarization axis relative to the crystal axis
suggesting that the induced charge separation reflects the anisotropic
electronic structure. We find good agreement with very recent experimental data

    <p>The magnetic properties, electronic band structure and Fermi surfaces of the
hexagonal Cr2GeC system have been studied by means of both generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) and the +U corrected method (GGA+U). The effective U value
has been computed within the augmented plane-wave theoretical scheme by
following the constrained density functional theory formalism of Anisimov et
al. [1991 Phys. Rev. B 45, 7570]. On the basis of our GGA+U calculations, a
compensated anti-ferromagnetic spin ordering of Cr atoms has been found to be
the ground state solution for this material, where a Ge-mediated super-exchange
coupling is responsible for an opposite spin distribution between the ABA
stacked in-plane Cr-C networks. Structural properties have also been tested and
found to be in good agreement with the available experimental data. Topological
analysis of Fermi surfaces have been used to qualitatively address the
electronic transport properties of Cr2GeC and found an important asymmetrical
carrier-type distribution within the hexagonal crystal lattice. We conclude
that an appropriate description of the strongly correlated Cr-d electrons is an
essential issue for interpreting the material properties of this unusual

    <p>We elucidate the origin of large differences (two-fold or more) in the
fixed-node errors between the first- vs second-row systems for
single-configuration trial wave functions in quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
This significant difference in the fixed-node biases is studied across a set of
atoms, molecules, and also Si, C solid crystals. The analysis is done over
valence isoelectronic systems that share similar correlation energies, bond
patterns, geometries, ground states, and symmetries. We show that the key
features which affect the fixed-node errors are the differences in electron
density and the degree of node nonlinearity. The findings reveal how the
accuracy of the quantum Monte Carlo varies across a variety of systems, provide
new perspectives on the origins of the fixed-node biases in electronic
structure calculations of molecular and condensed systems, and carry
implications for pseudopotential constructions for heavy elements</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Making use of the energetics and equations of state of defective uranium
dioxide that calculated with first-principles method, we demonstrate a
possibility of constraining the formation energy of point defects by measuring
the transition pressures of the corresponding pseudo-phase of defects. The
mechanically stable range of fluorite structure of UO2, which dictates the
maximum possible pressure of relevant pseudo-phase transitions, gives rise to
defect formation energies that span a wide band and overlap with the existing
experimental estimates. We reveal that the knowledge about pseudo-phase
boundaries can not only provide important information of energetics that is
helpful for reducing the scattering in current estimates, but also be valuable
for guiding theoretical assessments, even to validate or disprove a theory. In
order to take defect interactions into account and to extrapolate the physical
quantities at finite stoichiometry deviations to that near the stoichiometry,
we develop a general formalism to describe the thermodynamics of a defective
system. We also show that it is possible to include interactions among defects
in a simple expression of point defect model (PDM) by introducing an auxiliary
constant mean-field. This generalization of the simple PDM leads to great
versatility that allows one to study nonlinear effects of stoichiometry
deviation on materials' behavior. It is a powerful tool to extract the defect
energetics from finite defect concentrations to the dilute limit. Besides
these, the full content of the theoretical formalism and some relevant and
interesting issues, including reentrant pseudo-transition, multi-defect
coexistence, charged defects, and possible consequence of instantaneous
defective response in a quantum crystal, are explored and discussed.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A mathematical model of plastic deformation in face-centered cubic (FCC)
materials based on a balance model taking into account fundamental properties
of deformation defects of a crystal lattice was developed. This model is based
on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) accounting for various
mechanisms of generation and annihilation of deformation defects for different
external conditions. In-house developed software, SPFCC (Slip Plasticity of
Face-Centered Cubic), was employed to solve the system of ordinary differential
equations. The implemented code solves efficiently the stiff ODE system and
provides a user-friendly interface for investigation of various features of
plastic deformation in FCC materials. Simulation of plastic deformation in the
FCC metals was performed for the case of constant strain rate. The modelling
results were validated by comparing experimental data and simulation results
(stress-strain curves) and good agreement was obtained.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Hybrid density functionals show great promise for chemically-accurate first
principles calculations, but their high computational cost limits their
application in non-trivial studies, such as exploration of reaction pathways of
adsorbents on periodic surfaces. One factor responsible for their increased
cost is the dense Brillouin-zone sampling necessary to accurately resolve an
integrable singularity in the exact exchange energy. We analyze this
singularity within an intuitive formalism based on Wannier-function
localization and analytically prove Wigner-Seitz truncation to be the ideal
method for regularizing the Coulomb potential in the exchange kernel. We show
that this method is limited only by Brillouin-zone discretization errors in the
Kohn-Sham orbitals, and hence converges the exchange energy exponentially with
the number of k-points used to sample the Brillouin zone for all but
zero-temperature metallic systems. To facilitate the implementation of this
method, we develop a general construction for the plane-wave Coulomb kernel
truncated on the Wigner-Seitz cell in one, two or three lattice directions. We
compare several regularization methods for the exchange kernel in a variety of
real systems including low-symmetry crystals and low-dimensional materials. We
find that our Wigner-Seitz truncation systematically yields the best k-point
convergence for the exchange energy of all these systems and delivers an
accuracy to hybrid functionals comparable to semi-local and screened-exchange
functionals at identical k-point sets.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The propagation of high-energy electrons in crystals is in general a
complicated multiple scattering problem. However, along high-symmetry zone axes
the problem can be mapped to the time evolution of a two-dimensional (2D)
molecular system. Each projected atomic column can be approximated by the
potential of a 2D screened hydrogenic atom. When two columns are in close
proximity, their bound states overlap and form analogs to molecular orbitals.
For sub-angstrom electron beams, excitation of anti-symmetric orbitals can
result in the failure of the simple incoherent imaging approximation. As a
result, the standard resolution test and the one-to-one correspondence of
atomic positions of a crystal imaged along a zone-axis with closely spaced
projected columns ("dumbbells") can fail dramatically at finite and realistic
sample thicknesses. This is demonstrated experimentally in high angle annular
dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF STEM) images of
[211]-oriented Si showing an apparent inter-column spacing of 1.28(+-.09)
Angstroms, over 64% larger than the actual 0.78 Angstrom spacing. Furthermore,
the apparent spacing can be tuned with sample thickness and probe size to
produce a larger, smaller, or even the actual spacing under conditions when the
peaks of two adjacent Si columns should not even have been resolved given the
electron probe size.</p>

    <p>A controversy exists among literature reports of constraints on elastic

that are inconsistent with experiments. However, it can be shown that some EAM

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighbourhood
environments, and analyse their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness
and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties
that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are
differentiability with respect to moving the atoms, and invariance to the basic
symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of
atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors
that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach,
in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers
are used to expand the atomic neighbourhood density function. Using the example
system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to
be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbours
increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of
the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether
new approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), that sidesteps
these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two
neighbourhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the
invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations
by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and
the bulk crystal.</p>

    <p>The characteristics of phonons, i.e. linearized normal modes of vibration,
provide important insights into many aspects of crystals, e.g. stability and
thermodynamics. In this paper, we use the Objective Structures framework to
make concrete analogies between crystalline phonons and normal modes of
vibration in non-crystalline but highly symmetric nanostructures. Our strategy
is to use an intermediate linear transformation from real-space to an
intermediate space in which the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is
block-circulant. The block-circulant nature of the Hessian enables us to then
follow the procedure to obtain phonons in crystals: namely, we use the Discrete
Fourier Transform from this intermediate space to obtain a block-diagonal
matrix that is readily diagonalizable. We formulate this for general Objective
Structures and then apply it to study carbon nanotubes of various chiralities
that are subjected to axial elongation and torsional deformation. We compare
the phonon spectra computed in the Objective Framework with spectra computed
for armchair and zigzag nanotubes. We also demonstrate the approach by
computing the Density of States. In addition to the computational efficiency
afforded by Objective Structures in providing the transformations to
almost-diagonalize the Hessian, the framework provides an important conceptual
simplification to interpret the phonon curves.</p>

genetic algorithm. For barium, we observed all of the expected phases and a
number of new metastable structures, excluding the incommensurate Ba-IV
structure. We also observed a heretofore unreported structure (\alpha-Sm)
predicted to be the ground state from 30-42 GPa. In the Na-Ca system, we
demonstrate feasibility of our search method, but have been unable to predict
any stable compounds. These results have improved the efficacy of the genetic

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Facetted growth of snow crystals leads to a rich diversity of forms, and
exhibits a remarkable sixfold symmetry. Snow crystal structures result from
diffusion limited crystal growth in the presence of anisotropic surface energy
and anisotropic attachment kinetics. It is by now well understood that the
morphological stability of ice crystals strongly depends on supersaturation,
crystal size and temperature. Until very recently it was very difficult to
perform numerical simulations of this highly anisotropic crystal growth. In
particular, obtaining facet growth in combination with dendritic branching is a
challenging task. We present numerical simulations of snow crystal growth in
two and three space dimensions using a new computational method recently
introduced by the authors. We present both qualitative and quantitative
computations. In particular, a linear relationship between tip velocity and
supersaturation is observed. The computations also suggest that surface energy
effects, although small, have a larger effect on crystal growth than previously
expected. We compute solid plates, solid prisms, hollow columns, needles,
dendrites, capped columns and scrolls on plates. Although all these forms
appear in nature, most of these forms are computed here for the first time in
numerical simulations for a continuum model.</p>

    <p>Wannier function expansions are well suited for the description of photonic-
crystal-based defect structures, but constructing maximally localized Wannier
functions by optimizing the phase degree of freedom of the Bloch modes is
crucial for the efficiency of the approach. We systematically analyze different
locality criteria for maximally localized Wannier functions in two- dimensional
square and triangular lattice photonic crystals, employing (local)
conjugate-gradient as well as (global) genetic-algorithm-based, stochastic
methods. Besides the commonly used second moment (SM) locality measure, we
introduce a new locality measure, namely the integrated modulus (IM) of the
Wannier function. We show numerically that, in contrast to the SM criterion,
the IM criterion leads to an optimization problem with a single extremum, thus
allowing for fast and efficient construction of maximally localized Wannier
functions using local optimization techniques. We also present an analytical
formula for the initial choice of Bloch phases, which under certain conditions
represents the global maximum of the IM criterion and, thus, further increases
the optimization efficiency in the general case.</p>

    <p>An enhanced static approximation for the electron self energy operator is
proposed for efficient calculation of quasiparticle energies. Analysis of the
static COHSEX approximation originally proposed by Hedin shows that most of the
error derives from the short wavelength contributions of the assumed adiabatic
accumulation of the Coulomb-hole. A wavevector dependent correction factor can
be incorporated as the basis for a new static approximation. This factor can be
approximated by a single scaling function, determined from the homogeneous
electron gas model. The local field effect in real materials is captured by a
simple ansatz based on symmetry consideration. As inherited from the COHSEX
approximation, the new approximation presents a Hermitian self-energy operator
and the summation over empty states is eliminated from the evaluation of the
self energy operator. Tests were conducted comparing the new approximation to
GW calculations for diverse materials ranging from crystals and nanotubes. The
accuracy for the minimum gap is about 10% or better. Like in the COHSEX
approximation, the occupied bandwidth is overestimated.</p>

    <p>We have used neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation (muSR) to investigate the structural and magnetic properties of the beta-phase of elemental manganese doped with dilute amounts of indium. beta-Mn is an example of a topologically frustrated antiferromagnetically correlated metal - but which remains paramagnetic at all temperatures. The addition of In to beta-Mn results in a vast volume expansion of the lattice, and would therefore be expected to have a major effect on the stability and localization of the Mn moment - as observed in, for example, Ru and Al doped beta-Mn alloys. We find that In doping in beta-Mn results in a short-range ordered spin-glass like ground state, similar to that of Al-doped beta-Mn but with residual low frequency spin fluctuations. This is in contrast to Ru doping which results in the stabilization of a long-range ordered Mn moment</p>

    <p>The spatial fluctuations of deformation are studied in creep in the Andrade's power-law and the logarithmic phases, using paper samples. Measurements by the Digital Image Correlation technique show that the relative strength of the strain rate fluctuations increases with time, in both creep regimes. In the Andrade creep phase characterized by a power law decay of the strain rate $Œµ_t \sim t^{-Œ∏}$, with $Œ∏\approx 0.7$, the fluctuations obey $ŒîŒµ_t \sim t^{-Œ≥}$, with $Œ≥\approx 0.5$. The local deformation follows a data collapse appropriate for an absorbing state/depinning transition. Similar behavior is found in a crystal plasticity model, with a jamming or yielding phase transition.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The molecular mechanism of slip at the interface between polymer melts and weakly attractive smooth surfaces is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with our previous studies on slip flow of shear-thinning fluids, it is shown that the slip length passes through a local minimum at low shear rates and then increases rapidly at higher shear rates. We found that at sufficiently high shear rates, the slip flow over atomically flat crystalline surfaces is anisotropic. It is demonstrated numerically that the friction coefficient at the liquid-solid interface (the ratio of viscosity and slip length) undergoes a transition from a constant value to the power-law decay as a function of the slip velocity. The characteristic velocity of the transition correlates well with the diffusion velocity of fluid monomers in the first fluid layer near the solid wall at equilibrium. We also show that in the linear regime, the friction coefficient is well described by a function of a single variable, which is a product of the magnitude of surface-induced peak in the structure factor and the contact density of the adjacent fluid layer. The universal relationship between the friction coefficient and induced fluid structure holds for a number of material parameters of the interface: fluid density, chain length, wall-fluid interaction energy, wall density, lattice type and orientation, thermal or solid walls.</p>

    <p>We report the first terahertz Kerr measurements on bulk crystals of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. At T=10K and fields up to 8T, the real and imaginary Kerr angle and reflectance measurements utilizing both linearly and circularly polarized incident radiation were measured at a frequency of 5.24meV. A single fluid free carrier bulk response can not describe the line-shape. Surface states with a small mass and surprisingly large associated spectral weight quantitatively fit all data. However, carrier concentration inhomogeneity has not been ruled out. A method employing a gate is shown to be promising for separating surface from bulk effects.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have studied the dynamic response of Fe doped manganites with ac susceptibility measurements on bulk La0.65Ca0.35Mn1-yFeyO3 with 0.01<y<0.10 as functions of temperature and dc field. It is observed that the in phase part goes through a maximum that is removed on the application of moderate dc field. DC fields suppress both the components with the strongest effects being at or close to Tc. Conduction and ferromagnetism has been consistently suppressed by Fe doping. Increased spin disorder and decrease of Tc with increasing Fe content are evident. The variations in the critical temperature Tc and magnetic moment show a rapid change at about 4-5% Fe. The effect of Fe is seen to be consistent with the disruption of the Mn-Mn exchange possibly due to the formation of magnetic clusters. There is clear correlation between the structures in the resistivity and the in and out of phase parts of the susceptibility. With increasing Fe concentration the out of phase part (x'') peak shift to T<T1/2, but it stays consistently at the temperature where the resistivity changes slow down. The shoulder in x'' disappears above 4% Fe concentration. The peak of x'' moves to 8 or 10 K higher temperature on the application of a dc field, for 3 & 4 %Fe samples. Consistently two peaks are found in the ratios of x''/x'. We are seeing correspondence of dissipation with the change in R. We also see increasing low temperature dissipation in more strongly Fe doped samples i.e. increasing the Fe, leads to increased spin disorder and dissipation at low temperature. The effect of the dc field is discussed in terms of the suppression of spin fluctuations close to Tc and the changes in coercivity for lower temperatures.</p>

    <p>We present the results of numerical analysis of normal zone propagation in a stack of $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x}$ coated conductors which imitates a pancake coil. Our main purpose is to determine whether the quench protection quality of such coils can be substantially improved by increased contact resistance between the superconducting film and the stabilizer. We show that with increased contact resistance the speed of normal zone propagation increases, the detection of a normal zone inside the coil becomes possible earlier, when the peak temperature inside the normal zone is lower, and stability margins shrink. Thus, increasing contact resistance may become a viable option for improving the prospects of coated conductors for high $T_c$ magnets applications.</p>

    <p>We study combined effect of hydrostatic pressure and magnetic field on the magnetization of La${_{0.5}}$Ca${_{0.5}}$MnO${_{3}}$. We do not observe any significant effect of pressure on the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition. However, pressure asymmetrically affects the thermal hysteresis across the ferro-antiferromagnetic first-order transition, which has strong field dependence. Though the supercooling (T*) and superheating (T**) temperatures decrease and the value of magnetization at 5K (M$_{5K}$) increases with pressure, T* and M$_{5K}$ shows abrupt changes in tiny pressure of 0.68kbar. These anomalies enhance with field. In 7Tesla field, transition to antiferromagnetic phase disappears in 0.68kbar and M$_{5K}$ show significant increase. Thereafter, increase in pressure up to $\sim$10kbar has no noticeable effect on the magnetization.</p>

    <p>Cupric oxide is multiferroic at unusual high temperatures. From density functional calculations we find that the low-T magnetic phase is paraelectric and the higher-T one ferroelectric, with a size and direction of polarization in good agreement with experiment. By mapping of the ab initio results on an effective spin model we find with Monte Carlo that in the high-T magnetic state non-collinearity and inversion symmetry breaking stabilize each other via the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. This leads to a novel mechanism for multiferroicity, with the particular property that non-magnetic impurities enhance the effect.</p>

    <p>Polarizable interaction potentials, parametrized using ab initio electronic structure calculations, have been used in molecular dynamics simulations to study the conduction mechanism in Y2 O3 - and Sc2 O3 -doped zirconias. The influence of vacancy-vacancy and vacancy-cation interactions on the conductivity of these materials has been characterised. While the latter can be avoided by using dopant cations with radii which match those of Zr4+ (as is the case of Sc3+), the former is an intrinsic characteristic of the fluorite lattice which cannot be avoided and which is shown to be responsible for the occurrence of a maximum in the conductivity at dopant concentrations between 8 and 13 %. The weakness of the Sc-vacancy interactions in Sc2 O3 -doped zirconia suggests that this material is likely to present the highest conductivity achievable in zirconias.</p>

    <p>We study the robustness of Majorana zero energy modes and minigaps of quasiparticle excitations in a vortex by numerically solving Bogoliubov-deGennes equations in a heterostructure composed of an \textit{s} -wave superconductor, a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor thin film, and a magnetic insulator. This heterostructure was proposed recently as a platform for observing non-Abelian statistics and performing topological quantum computation. The dependence of the Majorana zero energy states and the minigaps on various physics parameters (Zeeman field, chemical potential, spin-orbit coupling strength) is characterized. We find the minigaps depend strongly on the spin-orbit coupling strength. In certain parameter region, the minigaps are linearly proportional to the \textit{s}-wave superconducting pairing gap $Œî_{s}$, which is very different from the $Œî_{s}^{2}$ dependence in a regular \textit{s-} or \textit{\p}-wave superconductor. We characterize the zero energy chiral edge state at the boundary and calculate the STM signal in the vortex core that shows a pronounced zero energy peak. We show that the Majorana zero energy states are robust in the presence of various types of impurities. We find the existence of impurity potential may increase the minigaps and thus benefit topological quantum computation.</p>

    <p>The tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition (SPT) in LaFeAsO (La-1111) and SmFeAsO (Sm-1111) single crystals measured by high resolution x-ray diffraction is found to be sharp while the RFeAsO (R=La, Nd, Pr, Sm) polycrystalline samples show a broad continuous SPT. Comparing the polycrystalline and the single crystal 1111 samples, the critical exponents of the SPT are found to be the same while the correlation length critical exponents are found to be very different. These results imply that the lattice fluctuations in 1111 systems change in samples with different surface to volume ratio that is assigned to the relieve of the temperature dependent superlattice misfit strain between active iron layers and the spacer layers in 1111 systems. This phenomenon that is missing in the AFe2As2 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba) "122" systems, with the same electronic structure but different for the thickness and the elastic constant of the spacer layers, is related with the different maximum superconducting transition temperature in the 1111 (55 K) versus 122 (35 K) systems and implies the surface reconstruction in 1111 single crystals.</p>

    <p>We report on the microscopic model of the recently synthesized one-dimensional quantum magnet (NO)Cu(NO3)3. Applying density functional theory band structure calculations, we obtain a leading antiferromagnetic exchange coupling J ~ 200 K, which runs via NO3 groups forming spin chains along the b direction. Much weaker couplings J' ~ 2 K link the chains into layers in a non-frustrated manner. Our calculations do not support the earlier conjecture on an anisotropic frustrated square lattice physics in (NO)Cu(NO3)3. In contrast, the model of uniform spin chains leads to a remarkably good fit of the experimental magnetic susceptibility data, although the low-temperature features of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility measured by electron spin resonance might call for extension of the model. We outline possible experiments to observe the suggested long-range magnetic ordering in (NO)Cu(NO3)3 and briefly compare this compound to other spin-1/2 uniform-chain systems.</p>

The absorption of monolayer graphene can be saturated at lower excitation intensity compared to multilayer graphene, graphene with wrinkle-like defects, and functionalized graphene. Monolayer graphene has a remarkable large modulation depth of 95.3%, whereas the modulation depth of multilayer graphene is greatly reduced due to nonsaturable absorption and scattering loss. Picoseconds ultrafast laser pulse (1.23 ps) can be generated using monolayer graphene as saturable absorber. Due to the ultrafast relaxation time, larger modulation depth and lower scattering loss of monolayer graphene, it performs better than multilayer graphene in terms of pulse shaping ability, pulse stability and output energy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We investigate the behavior of vortices of multi-component superconductivity, realized in $\rm{MgB_2}$ and Fe-based superconductors, within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory in terms of numerical calculations of the time-dependent GL equations and the variational method. It is revealed that close to the critical point of the composite system the inter-component coupling makes the system behave as a single component superconductivity in most cases. However, when the bare mean-field critical points of the two components coincide with each other, and furthermore the inter-band coupling disappears at the same temperature, interesting phenomena occur as follows. Vortices interact attractively at large separation and repulsively at short distance in certain parameter space. Because of the non-monotonic interaction profile, phase separations between vortex clusters of triangular order and the Meissner state take place, which indicates a first-order phase transition associated with the penetration of the magnetic field into a superconductor sample. Phase diagrams of vortex states are then constructed with the associated magnetization curve. It is found that all these behavior interpolates the features of the type I and II superconductors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Most materials in available macroscopic quantities are polycrystalline. Graphene, a recently discovered two-dimensional form of carbon with strong potential for replacing silicon in future electronics, is no exception. There is growing evidence of the polycrystalline nature of graphene samples obtained using various techniques. Grain boundaries, intrinsic topological defects of polycrystalline materials, are expected to dramatically alter the electronic transport in graphene. Here, we develop a theory of charge carrier transmission through grain boundaries composed of a periodic array of dislocations in graphene based on the momentum conservation principle. Depending on the grain boundary structure we find two distinct transport behaviours - either high transparency, or perfect reflection of charge carriers over remarkably large energy ranges. First-principles quantum transport calculations are used to verify and further investigate this striking behaviour. Our study sheds light on the transport properties of large-area graphene samples. Furthermore, purposeful engineering of periodic grain boundaries with tunable transport gaps would allow for controlling charge currents without the need of introducing bulk band gaps in otherwise semimetallic graphene. The proposed approach can be regarded as a means towards building practical graphene electronics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Linear magnetoresistance occurs in semiconductors as a consequence of strong electrical disorder and is characterized by nonsaturating magnetoresistance that is proportional to the applied magnetic field. By investigating a disordered MnAs-GaAs composite material, it is found that the magnitude of the linear magnetoresistance (LMR) is numerically equal to the carrier mobility over a wide range and is independent of carrier density. This behavior is complementary to the Hall effect that is independent of the mobility and dependent on the carrier density. Moreover, the LMR appears to be insensitive to the details of the disorder and points to a universal explanation of classical LMR that can be applied to other material systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In a previous paper [Jiao, Stillinger and Torquato, PRE 81, 011105 (2010)], we considered the geometrical ambiguity of pair statistics associated with point configurations. Here we focus on the analogous problem for heterogeneous media (materials). The complex structures of heterogeneous media are usually characterized via statistical descriptors, such as the $n$-point correlation function $S_n$. An intricate inverse problem of practical importance is to what extent a medium can be reconstructed from the two-point correlation function $S_2$ of a target medium. Recently, general claims of the uniqueness of reconstructions using $S_2$ have been made based on numerical studies. Here, we provide a systematic approach to characterize the geometrical ambiguity of $S_2$ for both continuous two-phase heterogeneous media and their digitized representations in a mathematically precise way. In particular, we derive the exact conditions for the case where two distinct media possess identical $S_2$. The degeneracy conditions are given in terms of integral and algebraic equations for continuous media and their digitized representations, respectively. By examining these equations and constructing their rigorous solutions for specific examples, we conclusively show that in general $S_2$ is indeed not sufficient information to uniquely determine the structure of the medium, which is consistent with the results of our recent study on heterogeneous media reconstruction [Jiao, Stillinger and Torquato, PNAS 106, 17634 (2009)]. The uniqueness issue of multiphase media reconstructions and additional structural information required to characterize heterogeneous media are discussed.</p>

    <p>Four fundamental dimer manipulations can be used to produce a variety of localized and extended defect structures in graphene. Two-dimensional templates result in graphene allotropes, here viewed as extended defects, which can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting electrical character. \emph{Embedded allotropic ribbons}--i.e. thin swaths of the new allotropes--can also be created within graphene. We examine these ribbons and find that they maintain the electrical character of their parent allotrope even when only a few atoms in width.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We report ac magnetic susceptibility and dc magnetization measurements on the superconducting ferromagnet UCoGe (with superconducting and Curie temperatures of $T_{\rm SC} \sim 0.5$~K and $T_{\rm Curie} \sim 2.5$~K, respectively). In the normal, ferromagnetic state ($T_{\rm SC} < T < T_{\rm Curie}$), the magnetization curve exhibits a hysteresis loop similar to that of a regular itinerant ferromagnet. Upon lowering the temperature below $T_{\rm SC}$, the spontaneous magnetization is unchanged, but the hysteresis is markedly enhanced. Even deeply inside the superconducting state, ferromagnetism is not completely shielded, and there is no Meissner region, a magnetic field region of $H < H_{\rm c1}$ (a lower critical field). From these results, we suggest that UCoGe is the first material in which ferromagnetism robustly survives in the superconducting state and a spontaneous vortex state without the Meissner state is realized.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We study charge fractionalization in bilayer graphene which is intimately related to its zero modes. In the unbiased case, the valley zero modes occur in pairs rendering it unsuitable for charge fractionalization. A bias plays the role of a bosonic field with nontrivial topology allowing for the exploration of Dirac-like dynamics at higher particle momenta. It also induces an odd number of zero modes, which, together with the conjugation symmetry between positive and negative energy states, are the requisite conditions for charge fractionalization. A self-conjugate, localized zero mode is constructed for a semi-infinite graphene sheet with zigzag edge; scenarios can occur readily where one sublattice component (pseudospin) dominates. While the other valley also has a similar zero mode, a layer asymmetry can be invoked to lift this degeneracy allowing for detection of distinguishable charge-1/2 edge states per valley.</p>

    <p>In this work we argue that it is important to make a proper choice of the unit cell within tight-binding theory if one aims to compute the optical matrix elements. By considering zigzag graphene nanoribbons, we demonstrate that the band structure is insensitive to the choice of the unit cell. However, if the chosen unit cell does not incorporate the symmetries of the system, wrong values of optical matrix elements are obtained, leading to the violation of well-known selection rules. This result holds irrespective of the formalism utilized for calculating the optical matrix elements.</p>

    <p>In this report, we achieved total transmission and reflection in a slab of
zero index materials with defect(s). By controlling the defect's radius and
dielectric constant, we can obtain total transmission and reflection of EM
wave. The zero index materials, in this report, stand for materials with
permittivity and permeability which are simultaneously equal to zero or so
called matched impedance zero index materials. Along with theoretical
calculations and simulation demonstrations, we also discuss about some possible

without restricting its view. We also suggest a way to control total

materials such as liquid crystal and BST. The physics behind those phenomena is
attributed to intrinsic properties of zero index materials: constant field

    <p>Double-exchange mechanisms in RE$_{1-x}$AE$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ manganites (where RE is a trivalent rare-earth ion and AE is a divalent alkali-earth ion) relies on the strong exchange interaction between two Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ ions through interfiling oxygen 2p states. Nevertheless, the role of RE and AE ions has ever been considered "silent" with respect to the DE conducting mechanisms. Here we show that a new path for DE-mechanism is indeed possible by partially replacing the RE-AE elements by Mn$^{2+}$-ions, in La-deficient La$_{x}$MnO$_{3-Œ¥}$ thin films. X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the relevant presence of Mn$^{2+}$ ions, which is unambiguously proved to be substituted at La-site by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering. Mn$^{2+}$ is proved to be directly correlated to the enhanced magneto-transport properties because of an additional hopping mechanism trough interfiling Mn$^{2+}$-ions, theoretically confirmed by calculations within the effective single band model. The very idea to use Mn$^{2+}$ both as a doping element and an ions electronically involved in the conduction mechanism, has never been foreseen, revealing a new phenomena in transport properties of manganites. More important, such a strategy might be also pursed in other strongly correlated materials.</p>

    <p>The separation of micron-sized bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus) from a steady flow of water through the use of ultrasonic standing waves is demonstrated. An ultrasonic resonator with cross-section of 0.0254 m x 0.0254 m has been designed with a flow inlet and outlet for a water stream that ensures laminar flow conditions into and out of the resonator section of the flow tube. A 0.01905-m diameter PZT-4, nominal 2-MHz transducer is used to generate ultrasonic standing waves in the resonator. The acoustic resonator is 0.0356 m from transducer face to the opposite reflector wall with the acoustic field in a direction orthogonal to the water flow direction. At fixed frequency excitation, spores are concentrated at the stable locations of the acoustic radiation force and trapped in the resonator region. The effect of the transducer voltage and frequency on the efficiency of spore capture in the resonator has been investigated. Successful separation of B. cereus spores from water with typical volume flow rates of 40-250 ml/min has been achieved with 15% efficiency in a single pass at 40 ml/min.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Low dimensional materials provide the possibility of improved thermoelectric performance due to the additional length scale degree of freedom for engineering their electronic and thermal properties. As a result of suppressed phonon conduction, large improvements on the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, have been recently reported in nanostructures, compared to the raw materials' ZT values. In addition, low dimensionality can improve a device's power factor, offering an additional enhancement in ZT. In this work the atomistic sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled tight-binding model is used to calculate the electronic structure of silicon nanowires (NWs). The Landauer formalism is applied to calculate an upper limit for the electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the power factor. We examine n-type and p-type nanowires of diameters from 3nm to 12nm, in [100], [110], and [111] transport orientations at different doping concentrations. Using experimental values for the lattice thermal conductivity in nanowires, an upper limit for ZT is computed. We find that at room temperature, scaling the diameter below 7nm can at most double the power factor and enhance ZT. In some cases, however, scaling does not enhance the performance at all. Orientations, geometries, and subband engineering techniques for optimized designs are discussed.</p>

For realistic conditions the force is dominated by the area compressibility modulus $Œ∫_A$ of the bilayer, and, to an excellent approximation, given by $F= œÄŒ∫_A R z_0^2/(2d-z_0)^2$. The experimental AFM force curves from coexisting liquid ordered and liquid disordered domains in 3-component lipid bilayers are well-described by our model, and provides $Œ∫_A$ in agreement with literature values. The liquid ordered phase has a yield like response that we model by hydrogen bond breaking.</p>

    <p>The tunnel photocurrent between a gold surface and a free-standing semiconducting thin film excited from the rear by above bandgap light has been measured as a function of applied bias, tunnel distance and excitation light power. The results are compared with the predictions of a model which includes the bias dependence of the tunnel barrier height and the bias-induced decrease of surface recombination velocity. It is found that i) the tunnel photocurrent from the conduction band dominates that from surface states. ii) At large tunnel distance the exponential bias dependence of the current is explained by that of the tunnel barrier height, while at small distance the change of surface recombination velocity is dominant.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have demonstrated the effect of pressure on magnetization jump and its associated magnetostriction in Eu$_{0.58}$Sr$_{0.42}$MnO$_{3}$. The critical field lowered by the applied pressure is explained by a suppression of the metastable blocked state, which is inherent to the phase separated manganite system exhibiting the magnetic avalanche. To reduce a factor of the bad thermal coupling in the bulk sample, and to further examine the nature of the magnetization jump, we have performed the influence of pressure on the isothermal magnetization of the powder sample. There is no discrepancy in the critical field between the bulk and powder samples although the $MH$ curve of the latter is not saturated at high fields. These findings indicate a crucial role of the frozen phase separated state in the abrupt transition.</p>

    <p>The linked cell list algorithm is an essential part of molecular simulation software, both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo. Though it scales linearly with the number of particles, there has been a constant interest in increasing its efficiency, because a large part of CPU time is spent to identify the interacting particles. Several recent publications proposed improvements to the algorithm and investigated their efficiency by applying them to particular setups. In this publication we develop a general method to evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms, which is mostly independent of the parameters of the simulation, and test it for a number of linked cell list algorithms. We also propose a combination of linked cell reordering and interaction sorting that shows a good efficiency for a broad range of simulation setups.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a new ferrimagnetic decorated spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg chain with spin-1 pendant spins are investigated for three cases: (A) J1,J2>0; (B) J1>0, J2<0; and (C) J1<0, J2>0, where J1 and J2 are the exchange couplings between spins in the chain and along the rung, respectively. The low-lying and magnetic properties are explored jointly by the real-space renormalization group, spin wave, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, while the transfer-matrix renormalization group method is invoked to study the thermodynamics. It is found that the magnon spectra consist of a gapless and two gapped branches. Two branches in case (C) have intersections. The coupling dependence of low-energy gaps are analyzed. In a magnetic field, an m=3/2 (m is the magnetization per unit cell) plateau is observed for case (A), while two plateaux at m=1/2 and 3/2 are observed for cases (B) and (C). Between the two plateaux in cases (B) and (C), the sublattice magnetizations for the spins coupled by ferromagnetic interactions have novel decreasing regions with increasing the magnetic field. At finite temperature, the zero-field susceptibility temperature product chi*T and specific heat exhibit distinct exotic features with varying the couplings and temperature for different cases. chi*T is found to converge as T approaches zero, which is different from the divergent behavior in the spin-(1/2,1) mixed-spin chain without pendants. The observed thermodynamic behaviors are also discussed with the help of their low-lying excitations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Semiconductor glasses exhibit many unique optical and electronic anomalies. We have put forth a semi-phenomenological scenario (J. Chem. Phys. 132, 044508 (2010)) in which several of these anomalies arise from deep midgap electronic states residing on high-strain regions intrinsic to the activated transport above the glass transition. Here we demonstrate at the molecular level how this scenario is realized in an important class of semiconductor glasses, namely chalcogen and pnictogen containing alloys. Both the glass itself and the intrinsic electronic midgap states emerge as a result of the formation of a network composed of $œÉ$-bonded atomic $p$-orbitals that are only weakly hybridized. Despite a large number of weak bonds, these $ppœÉ$-networks are stable with respect to competing types of bonding, while exhibiting a high degree of structural degeneracy. The stability is rationalized with the help of a hereby proposed structural model, by which $ppœÉ$-networks are symmetry-broken and distorted versions of a high symmetry structure. The latter structure exhibits exact octahedral coordination and is fully covalently-bonded. The present approach provides a microscopic route to a fully consistent description of the electronic and structural excitations in vitreous semiconductors.</p>

Various kinds of objects that have different sizes, shapes and constitutive parameters can be cloaked using the same device.

    <p>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) exploits surface plasmons induced by the incident field in metallic nanostructures to significantly increase the Raman intensity. Graphene provides the ideal prototype two dimensional (2d) test material to investigate SERS. Its Raman spectrum is well known, graphene samples are entirely reproducible, height controllable down to the atomic scale, and can be made virtually defect-free. We report SERS from graphene, by depositing arrays of Au particles of well defined dimensions on graphene/SiO$_2$(300nm)/Si. We detect significant enhancements at 633nm. To elucidate the physics of SERS, we develop a quantitative analytical and numerical theory. The 2d nature of graphene allows for a closed-form description of the Raman enhancement. This scales with the nanoparticle cross section, the fourth power of the Mie enhancement, and is inversely proportional to the tenth power of the separation between graphene and the nanoparticle. One consequence is that metallic nanodisks are an ideal embodiment for SERS in 2d.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the simplest model of an ionic liquid, called the restricted primitive model, at a metal surface. We find that at moderately low temperatures the capacitance of the metal/ionic liquid interface is so large that the effective thickness of the electrostatic double-layer is up to 3 times smaller than the ion radius. To interpret these results we suggest an approach which is based on the interaction between discrete ions and their image charges in the metal surface and which therefore goes beyond the mean-field approximation. When a voltage is applied across the interface, the strong image attraction causes counterions to condense onto the metal surface to form compact ion-image dipoles. These dipoles repel each other to form a correlated liquid. When the surface density of these dipoles is low, the insertion of an additional dipole does not require much energy. This leads to a large capacitance $C$ that decreases monotonically with voltage $V$, producing a "bell-shaped" curve $C(V)$. We also consider what happens when the electrode is made from a semi-metal rather than a perfect metal. In this case, the finite screening radius of the electrode shifts the reflection plane for image charges to the interior of the electrode and we arrive at a "camel-shaped" $C(V)$. These predictions seem to be in qualitative agreement with experiment.</p>

    <p>Single-crystalline thin film of an iridium dioxide polymorph Ir2O4 has been fabricated by the pulsed laser deposition of LixIr2O4 precursor and the subsequent Li-deintercalation using soft chemistry. Ir2O4 crystallizes in a spinel (AB2O4) without A cations in the tetrahedral site, which is isostructural to lambda-MnO2. Ir ions form a pyrochlore sublattice, which is known to give rise to a strong geometrical frustration. This Ir spinel was found to be a narrow gap insulator, in remarkable contrast to the metallic ground state of rutile-type IrO2. We argue that an interplay of strong spin-orbit coupling and a Coulomb repulsion gives rise to an insulating ground state as in a layered perovskite Sr2IrO4.</p>

Recent technological advances[3] allow for the fabrication of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles (Stoner particles), whose magnetization dynamics have been extensively studied, both experimentally and theoretically, involving magnetic fields[4-9] and/or by spin-polarized currents[10-20]. From an industrial point of view, important issues include lowering the critical switching field $H_c$, and achieving short reversal times. Here we predict a new technological perspective: $H_c$ can be dramatically lowered (including $H_c=0$) by appropriately engineering the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) in a system of two synchronized Stoner particles. Here, in a modified Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) limit, both of the above goals can be achieved. The experimental feasibility of realizing our proposal is illustrated on the example of cobalt nanoparticles.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Mean-field theories claim that the capacitance of the double-layer formed at a metal/ionic conductor interface cannot be larger than that of the Helmholtz capacitor, whose width is equal to the radius of an ion. However, in some experiments the apparent width of the double-layer capacitor is substantially smaller. We propose an alternate, non-mean-field theory of the ionic double-layer to explain such large capacitance values. Our theory allows for the binding of discrete ions to their image charges in the metal, which results in the formation of interface dipoles. We focus primarily on the case where only small cations are mobile and other ions form an oppositely-charged background. In this case, at small temperature and zero applied voltage dipoles form a correlated liquid on both contacts. We show that at small voltages the capacitance of the double-layer is determined by the transfer of dipoles from one electrode to the other and is therefore limited only by the weak dipole-dipole repulsion between bound ions, so that the capacitance is very large. At large voltages the depletion of bound ions from one of the capacitor electrodes triggers a collapse of the capacitance to the much smaller mean-field value, as seen in experimental data. We test our analytical predictions with a Monte Carlo simulation and find good agreement. We further argue that our ``one-component plasma" model should work well for strongly asymmetric ion liquids. We believe that this work also suggests an improved theory of pseudo-capacitance.</p>

    <p>We have calculated the electronic structure of Eu for the bcc, hcp, and fcc crystal structures for volumes near equilibrium up to a calculated 90 GPa pressure using the augmented-plane wave method in the local-density approximation. The frozen-core approximation was used with a semi-empirical shift of the f-states energies in the radial Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation to move the occupied 4f valence states below the $Œì_1$ energy and into the core.  This shift of the highly localized f-states yields the correct europium phase ordering with lattice parameters and bulk moduli in good agreement with experimental data. The calculated superconductivity properties under pressure for the $\it bcc$ and $\it hcp$ structures are also found to agree with and follow a $T_c$ trend similar to recent measurement by Debessai et al.$^1$</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The dispersion energy between extended molecular chains (or equivalently infinite wires) with non-zero band gaps is generally assumed to be expressible as a pair-wise sum of atom-atom terms which decay as $R^{-6}$. Using a model system of two parallel wires with a variable band gap, we show that this is not the case. The dispersion interaction scales as $z^{-5}$ for large interwire separations $z$, as expected for an insulator, but as the band gap decreases the interaction is greatly enhanced; while at shorter (but non-overlapping) separations it approaches a power-law scaling given by $z^{-2}$, \emph{i.e.} the dispersion interaction expected between \emph{metallic} wires. We demonstrate that these effects can be understood from the increasing length scale of the plasmon modes (charge fluctuations), and their increasing contribution to the molecular dipole polarizability and the dispersion interaction, as the band gaps are reduced. This result calls into question methods which invoke locality assumptions in deriving dispersion interactions between extended small-gap systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We enumerate all minimal energy packings (MEPs) for small single linear and ring polymers composed of spherical monomers with contact attractions and hard-core repulsions, and compare them to corresponding results for monomer packings. We define and identify ``dividing surfaces" in polymer packings, which reduce the number of arrangements that satisfy hard-sphere and covalent bond constraints. Compared to monomer MEPs, polymer MEPs favor intermediate structural symmetry over high and low symmetries. We also examine the packing-preparation dependence for longer single chains using molecular dynamics simulations. For slow temperature quenches, chains form crystallites with close-packed cores. As quench rate increases, the core size decreases and the exterior becomes more disordered. By examining the contact number, we connect suppression of crystallization to the onset of isostaticity in disordered packings. These studies represent a significant step forward in our ability to predict how the structural and mechanical properties of compact polymers depend on collapse dynamics.</p>

    <p>We present theoretical and experimental studies of Schottky diodes that use aligned arrays of single walled carbon nanotubes. A simple physical model, taking into account the basic physics of current rectification, can adequately describe the single-tube and array devices. We show that for as grown array diodes, the rectification ratio, defined by the maximum-to-minimum-current-ratio, is low due to the presence of m-SWNT shunts. These tubes can be eliminated in a single voltage sweep resulting in a high rectification array device. Further analysis also shows that the channel resistance, and not the intrinsic nanotube diode properties, limits the rectification in devices with channel length up to ten micrometer.</p>

    <p>We investigate the role of surface plasmons in the electromagnetic Casimir effect at finite temperature, including situations out of global thermal equilibrium. The free energy is calculated analytically and expanded for different regimes of distances and temperatures. Similar to the zero-temperature case, the interaction changes from attraction to repulsion with distance. Thermal effects are shown to be negligible for small plate separations and at room temperature, but become dominant and repulsive at large values of these parameters. In configurations out of global thermal equilibrium, we show that the selective excitation of surface plasmons can create a repulsive Casimir force between metal plates.</p>

    <p>We present a detailed study on the magnetic properties, including anisotropy, reversal fields, and magnetization reversal processes, of well characterized half-metallic epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) thin films grown onto SrTiO3 (STO) substrates with three different surface orientations, i.e. (001), (110) and (1-18). The latter shows step edges oriented parallel to the [110] (in-plane) crystallographic direction. Room temperature high resolution vectorial Kerr magnetometry measurements have been performed at different applied magnetic field directions in the whole angular range. In general, the magnetic properties of the LSMO films can be interpreted with just the uniaxial term with the anisotropy axis given by the film morphology, whereas the strength of this anisotropy depends on both structure and film thickness. In particular, LSMO films grown on nominally flat (110)-oriented STO substrates presents a well defined uniaxial anisotropy originated from the existence of elongated in-plane [001]-oriented structures, whereas LSMO films grown on nominally flat (001)-oriented STO substrates show a weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis direction aligned parallel to residual substrate step edges. Elongated structures are also found for LSMO films grown on vicinal STO(001) substrates. These films present a well-defined uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis lying along the step edges and its strength increases with the LSMO thickness. It is remarkable that this step-induced uniaxial anisotropy has been found for LSMO films up to 120 nm thickness. Our results are promising for engineering novel half-metallic magnetic devices that exploit tailored magnetic anisotropy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Despite more than two decades of intensive investigations, the true nature of high temperature (high-$T_c$) superconductivity observed in the cuprates remains elusive to the researchers.  In particular, in the so-called `underdoped' region, the overall behavior of superconductivity deviates $qualitatively$ from the standard theoretical description pioneered by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS).  Recently, the importance of phase fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter has gained significant support from various experiments.  However, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the surprisingly soft phase remains one of the most important unsolved puzzles.  Here, opposite to the standard BCS starting point, we propose a simple, solvable low-energy model in the strong coupling limit, which maps the superconductivity literally into a well-understood physics of superfluid in a special dilute bosonic system of local pairs of doped holes.  In the prototypical material (La$_{1-Œ¥}$Sr$_Œ¥$)$_2$CuO$_4$, without use of any free parameter, a $d$-wave superconductivity is obtained for doping above $\sim 5.2\%$, below which unexpected incoherent $p$-wave pairs dominate.  Throughout the whole underdoped region, very soft phases are found to originate from enormous mass enhancement of the pairs.  Furthermore, a striking mass divergence is predicted that dictates the occurrence of the observed quantum critical point.  Our model produces properties of the superfluid in good agreement with the experiments, and provides new insights into several current puzzles.  Owing to its simplicity, this model offers a paradigm of great value in answering the long-standing challenges in underdoped cuprates.</p>

    <p>A generic theory of the quasi-particle superconducting gap in underdoped cuprates is derived in the strong coupling limit, and found to describe extremely well the experimental "second gap" in \textit{absolute scale}.  In drastic contrast to the standard theories of Bogoliubov quasi-particle excitations, the quasi-particle gap is shown to originate from anomalous kinetic process, completely unrelated to the pairing strength.  Furthermore, the $k$-dependence of the gap deviates significantly from the pure $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave of the order parameter.  Our study reveals a new paradigm for the nature of superconducting gap, and is expected to reconcile numerous apparent contradictions among existing experiments toward a more coherent understanding of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

    <p>Using first-principles density functional calculations, we study the interplay of ferroelectricity and polar discontinuities in a range of 1-1 oxide superlattices, built out of ferroelectric and paraelectric components. Studies have been carried out for a varied choice of chemical composition of the components. We find that, when polar interfaces are present, the polar discontinuities induce off- centric movements in the ferroelectric layers, even though the ferroelectric is only one unit cell thick. The distortions yield non-switchable polarizations, with magnitudes comparable to those of the corresponding bulk ferroelectrics. In contrast, in superlattices with no polar discontinuity at the interfaces, the off-centric movements in the ferroelectric layer are usually suppressed. The details of the behavior and functional properties are, however, found to be sensitive to epitaxial strain, rotational instabilities and second-order Jahn-Teller activity, and are therefore strongly in uenced by the chemical composition of the paraelectric layer.</p>

    <p>Stimulated by the recent observation of œÄ-œÄ interactions between C60 and corannulene subunits in a molecular tweezer arrangement (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 3842), a density functional theory study was performed to analyze the electronic structure and properties of various noncovalent corannulene complexes. The theoretical approach is first applied to corannulene complexes with a series of benchmark molecules (CH4, NH3, and H2O) using several new-generation density functionals. The performance of nine density functionals, illustrated by computing binding energies of the corannulene complexes, demonstrates that Zhao and Truhlar's MPWB1K and M05-2X functionals provide energies similar to that obtained at the SCS-MP2 level. In contrast, most of the other popular density functionals fail to describe this noncovalent interaction or yield purely repulsive interactions. Further investigations with the M05-2X functional show that the binding energy of C60 with corannulene subunits in the relaxed molecular receptor clip geometry is -20.67 kcal/mol. The results of this calculation further support the experimental interpretation of pure œÄ-œÄ interactions between a convex fullerene and the concave surfaces of two corannulene subunits.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This paper describes a numerical experiment, based on full micromagnetic simulations of current-driven magnetization dynamics in nanoscale spin valves, to identify the origins of spectral linewidth broadening in spin torque oscillators. Our numerical results show two qualitatively different regimes of magnetization dynamics at zero temperature: regular (single-mode precessional dynamics) and chaotic. In the regular regime, the  dependence of the oscillator integrated power on frequency is linear, and consequently the dynamics is well described by the analytical theory of current-driven magnetization dynamics for moderate amplitudes of oscillations. We observe that for higher oscillator amplitudes, the functional dependence of the oscillator integrated power as a function of frequency is not a single-valued function and can be described numerically via introduction of nonlinear oscillator power. For a range of currents in the regular regime, the oscillator spectral linewidth is a linear function of temperature. In the chaotic regime found at large current values, the linewidth is not described by the analytical theory. In this regime we observe the oscillator linewidth broadening, which originates from sudden jumps of frequency of the oscillator arising from random domain wall nucleation and propagation through the sample. This intermittent behavior is revealed through a wavelet analysis that gives superior description of the frequency jumps compared to several other techniques.</p>

    <p>Electron spin dynamics in intrinsic bulk Indium Phosphide (InP) semiconductor is studied by time resolved pump probe reflectivity (TRPPR) technique using the co- and counter-circularly polarized femtosecond pulses at room temperature and 70 K. The reflectivity change from bleaching into absorption is observed with increasing pump photon energy, which can be explained in terms of the spin sensitive band filling and band gap renormalization effects. Density dependence of electron spin relaxation time shows similar tendency at room temperature and 70 K. With increasing carrier density, the electron spin relaxation time increases and then decreases after reaching a maximum value. Our experimental results agree well with the recent theoretical prediction [Jiang and Wu, Phys. Rev. B 79, 125206 (2009)] and D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism is considered as a dominating contribution to the electron spin relaxation in intrinsic bulk InP semiconductor.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A Fano-like phonon resonance is observed in few-layer (~3) graphene at room temperature using infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. This Fano resonance is the manifestation of a strong electron-phonon interaction between the discrete in-plane lattice vibrational mode and continuum electronic excitations in graphene. By employing ammonia chemical doping, we have obtained different Fano line shapes ranging from anti-resonance in hole-doped graphene to phonon-dominated in n-type graphene. The Fano resonance shows the strongest interference feature when the Fermi level is located near the Dirac point. The charged phonon exhibits much-enhanced oscillator strength and experiences a continuous red shift in frequency as electron density increases. It is suggested that the phonon couples to different electronic transitions as Fermi level is tuned by chemical doping.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a detailed analysis of resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) from Fe$_{1.087}$Te with unprecedented energy resolution. In contrast to the sharp peaks typically seen in insulating systems at the transition metal $L_3$ edge, we observe spectra which show different characteristic features. For low energy transfer, we experimentally observe theoretically predicted many-body effects of resonant Raman scattering from a non-interacting gas of fermions. Furthermore, we find that limitations to this many-body electron-only theory are realized at high Raman shift, where an exponential lineshape reveals an energy scale not present in these considerations. This regime, identified as emission, requires considerations of lattice degrees of freedom to understand the lineshape. We argue that both observations are intrinsic general features of many-body physics of metals.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The link between the energy surface of bulk systems and their dynamical properties is generally difficult to establish. Using the activation-relaxation technique (ART nouveau), we follow the change in the barrier distribution of a model of amorphous silicon as a function of the degree of relaxation. We find that while the barrier-height distribution, calculated from the initial minimum, is a unique function that depends only on the level of distribution, the reverse-barrier height distribution, calculated from the final state, is independent of the relaxation, following a different  function. Moreover, the resulting gained or released energy distribution is a simple convolution of these two distributions indicating that the activation and relaxation parts of a the elementary relaxation mechanism are completely independent. This characterized energy landscape can be used to explain nano-calorimetry measurements.</p>

    <p>Anomalous behaviour of the excess entropy ($S_e$) and the associated scaling relationship with diffusivity are compared in liquids with very different underlying interactions but similar water-like  anomalies: water (SPC/E and TIP3P models), tetrahedral ionic melts (SiO$_2$ and BeF$_2$) and a fluid with core-softened, two-scale ramp (2SRP) interactions. We demonstrate the presence of an excess entropy anomaly in the two water models.  Using length and energy scales appropriate for onset of anomalous behaviour, the density range of the excess entropy anomaly is shown to be much narrower in water than in ionic melts or the 2SRP fluid. While the  reduced  diffusivities ($D^*$) conform to the excess entropy scaling relation, $D^* =A\exp (Œ±S_e)$ for all the systems (Y. Rosenfeld, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 1977}, {\it 15}, 2545), the exponential scaling parameter, $Œ±$, shows a small isochore-dependence in the case of water. Replacing $S_e$ by pair correlation-based approximants accentuates the isochore-dependence of the diffusivity scaling. Isochores with similar diffusivity scaling parameters  are shown to have the temperature dependence of the corresponding entropic contribution. The relationship between diffusivity, excess entropy and pair correlation approximants to the excess entropy are very similar in all the tetrahedral liquids.</p>

    <p>It is a fact that the minimal conductivity $œÉ_0$ of most graphene samples is larger than the well-established universal value for ideal graphene $4e^2/œÄh$; in particular, larger by a factor $\gtrsimœÄ$. Despite intense theoretical activity, this fundamental issue has eluded an explanation so far. Here we present fully atomistic quantum mechanical estimates of the graphene minimal conductivity where electron-electron interactions are considered in the framework of density functional theory. We show the first conclusive evidence of the dominant role on the minimal conductivity of charged impurities over ripples, which have no visible effect. Furthermore, in combination with the logarithmic scaling law for diffusive metallic graphene, we ellucidate the origin of the ubiquitously observed minimal conductivity in the range $8e^2/h > œÉ_0 \gtrsim 4e^2/h$.</p>

    <p>Fundamental topological phenomena in condensed matter physics are associated with a quantized electromagnetic response in units of fundamental constants. Recently, it has been predicted theoretically that the time-reversal invariant topological insulator in three dimensions exhibits a topological magnetoelectric effect quantized in units of the fine structure constant $Œ±=e^2/\hbar c$. In this work, we propose an optical experiment to directly measure this topological quantization phenomenon, independent of material details. Our proposal also provides a way to measure the half-quantized Hall conductances on the two surfaces of the topological insulator independently of each other.</p>

    <p>This paper discusses a few unique effects of ultra-thin-body double-gate NMOSFET that are arising from the bandstructure of the thin film Si channel. The bandstructure has been calculated using 10-orbital $sp^3d^5s^*$ tight-binding method. A number of intrinsic properties including band gap, density of states, intrinsic carrier concentration and parabolic effective mass have been derived from the calculated bandstructure. The spatial distributions of intrinsic carrier concentration and $<100>$ effective mass, arising from the wavefunction of different contributing subbands are analyzed. A self-consistent solution of Poisson-Schrodinger coupled equation is obtained taking the full bandstructure into account, which is then applied to an insightful analysis of volume inversion. The spatial distribution of carriers over the channel of a DGFET has been calculated and its effects on effective mass and channel capacitance are discussed.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Intra and intersubband scattering rates and electron capture rates are considered when mediated by hybrid optical phonons in an AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double heterostructure confined between two outer metallic barriers. In evaluating scattering rates we concentrate first on an infinite quantum well for the electrons and show that the presence of the outer metal barriers results in reductions of the intra and intersubband scattering rates due to the suppression of the interface-like modes. For a quantum well (QW) with a finite depth we find that the outer barriers are responsible for the existence of a discrete energy spectrum above the well. The electron capture process under these circumstances is defined as the electron transition from the first electron subband above the well to all possible subbands inside the well by the emission of hybrid phonons. Explicit calculations reveal that the capture rates are characterized by sharp peaks, referred to as electron resonances which arise when a new electron state is generated on increasing the quantum well width. Other sharp peaks are identified as phonon resonances and arise when the energy of the initial state differs by a phonon energy from an electron state at the bottom of a quantum well subband.</p>

    <p>We study the velocity dependence of the frictional force of the tip of an atomic force microscope as it is dragged across a surface, taking into account memory effects and thermal fluctuations. Memory effects are described by a coupling of the tip to low frequency excitation modes of the surface in addition to the coupling to the periodic corrugation potential. We find that when the excitation mode frequency is comparable to the characteristic frequency corresponding to the motion of the tip across the  surface, the velocity dependence of the frictional force is non monotonic, displaying a velocity range where the frictional force can decrease with increasing velocity. These results provide theoretical support for the interpretation of recent experiments which find a frictional force that decreases with velocity on surfaces covered with a monolayer.</p>

This is also a rich domain for fundamental discoveries at the intersection of electron, lattice (phonon), and optical (photon) interactions. This review presents recent progress in understanding and manipulation of energy dissipation and transport in nanoscale solid-state structures. First, the landscape of power usage from nanoscale transistors (~10^-8 W) to massive data centers (~10^9 W) is surveyed. Then, focus is given to energy dissipation in nanoscale circuits, silicon transistors, carbon nanostructures, and semiconductor nanowires. Concepts of steady-state and transient thermal transport are also reviewed in the context of nanoscale devices with sub-nanosecond switching times. Finally, recent directions regarding energy transport are reviewed, including electrical and thermal conductivity of nanostructures, thermal rectification, and the role of ubiquitous material interfaces.</p>

    <p>Topological insulators (TIs) constitute a new class of materials with unique properties resulting from the relativistic-like character and topological protection of their surface states. Theory predicts these to exhibit a rich variety of physical phenomena such as anomalous magneto-electric coupling and Majorana excitations. Although TI surface states have been detected in Bi-based compounds by ARPES and STM techniques, electrical control over their density, required for most transport experiments, remains a challenge. Existing materials are heavily doped in the bulk, thus preventing electrical tunability of the surface states and their integration into topological quantum electronic devices. Here we show that electronic transport in metallic Bi2Se3 nanoscale devices can be controlled by tuning the surface density via the electric field effect. By choosing an appropriate high-k dielectric, we are able to shift the Fermi energy through the charge neutrality point of the surface states, resulting in ambipolar transport characteristics reminiscent of those observed in graphene. Combining magnetotransport, field effect, and geometry dependent experiments, we provide transport measurements of the surface state mobility, and identify likely scattering mechanisms by measuring its temperature dependence.</p>

    <p>Many technological applications of multiferroics are based on their ability to reconstruct the domain structure (DS) under the action of small external fields. In the present paper we analyze the different scenarios of the DS behavior in a multiferroic that shows simultaneously ferro- and antiferromagnetic ordering on the different systems of magnetic ions. We consider the way to control a composition of the DS and macroscopic properties of the sample by an appropriate field treatment. We found out that sensitivity of the DS to the  external magnetic field and the magnetic susceptibility in a low-field region are determined mainly by the destressing effects (that have magnetoelastic origin). In a particular case of Sr$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{4}$Cl$_{2}$ crystal we anticipate the peculiarities of the elastic and magnetoelastic properties at $T\approx 100$ K.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The phase field crystal (PFC) model captures the elastic and topological properties of crystals with a single scalar field at small undercooling. At large undercooling, new foam-like behavior emerges. We characterize this foam phase of the PFC equation and propose a modified PFC equation that may be used for the simulation of foam dynamics. This minimal model reproduces von Neumann's rule for two-dimensional dry foams, and Lifshitz-Slyozov coarsening for wet foams.  We also measure the coordination number distribution and find that its second moment is larger than previously-reported experimental and theoretical studies of soap froths, a finding that we attribute to the wetness of the foam increasing with time.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The liquid, plastic crystalline and ordered crystalline phases of CBr$_4$ were studied using neutron powder diffraction. The measured total scattering differential cross-sections were modelled by Reverse Monte Carlo simulation techniques (RMC++ and RMCPOW). Following successful simulations, the single crystal diffraction pattern of the plastic phase, as well as partial radial distribution functions and orientational correlations for all the three phases have been calculated from the atomic coordinates ('particle configurations'). The single crystal pattern, calculated from a configuration that had been obtained from modelling the powder pattern, shows identical behavior to the recent single crystal data of Folmer et al. (Phys. Rev. {\bf B77}, 144205 (2008)). The BrBr partial radial distribution functions of the liquid and plastic crystalline phases are almost the same, while CC correlations clearly display long range ordering in the latter phase. Orientational correlations also suggest strong similarities between liquid and plastic crystalline phases, whereas the monoclinic phase behaves very differently. Orientations of the molecules are distinct in the ordered phase, whereas in the plastic crystal their distribution seems to be isotropic.</p>

    <p>The dynamics of photocarriers in reduced graphene oxide thin films is studied by using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy.  Time dependent differential transmissions are measured with sample temperatures ranging from 9 to 300 K. At each sample temperature and probe delay, the sign of differential transmission remains positive. A fast energy relaxation of hot carriers is observed, and is found to be independent of sample temperature. Our experiments show that the carrier dynamics in reduced graphene oxide is similar to other types of graphene, and that the differential transmission is caused by phase-state filling of carriers.</p>

    <p>Trigonal zigzag graphene nanodisk exhibits magnetism whose spin is proportional to the edge length of the nanodisk. Its spin can be designed from 1/2 to a huge value. The spins form a quasiferromagnet, which has intermediate properties between a single spin and a ferromagnet. In other words, the ferromagnet order has a relatively long life time, and yet the nanodisk spin can be rotated by external field or current. We consider a nanodisk connected with two leads. This system acts as a spin filter just as in a metal-ferromagnet-metal junction. In this way we can generate a spin current. Furthermore we can manipulate spin current by spin valve, spin switch and other spintronic devices made of graphene nanodisks. We also show that nanodisk spins are robust against the effect of randomness in site energy, transfer energy and lattice defects.</p>

    <p>Based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a new charging method that should be capable of charging a Lithium-ion battery in a fraction of the time needed when using traditional methods. This charging method uses an additional applied oscillatory electric field. Our simulation results show that this charging method offers a great reduction in the average intercalation time for Li+ ions, which dominates the charging time. The oscillating field not only increases the diffusion rate of Li+ ions in the electrolyte but, more importantly, also enhances intercalation by lowering the corresponding overall energy barrier.</p>

    <p>We have studied the electronic structure of hexagonal MnAs, as epitaxial continuous film on GaAs(001) and as nanocrystals embedded in GaAs, by Mn 2p core-level photoemission spectroscopy. Configuration-interaction analyses based on a cluster model show that the ground state of the embedded MnAs nanocrystals is dominated by a d5 configuration that maximizes the local Mn moment. Nanoscaling and strain significantly alter the properties of MnAs. Internal strain in the nanocrystals results in reduced p-d hybridization and enhanced ionic character of the Mn-As bonding interactions. The spatial confinement and reduced p-d hybridization in the nanocrystals lead to enhanced d-electron localization, triggering d-d electron correlations and enhancing local Mn moments. These changes in the electronic structure of MnAs have an advantageous effect on the Curie temperature of the nanocrystals, which is measured to be remarkably higher than that of bulk MnAs.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The dynamics of flexible polymer molecules are often assumed to be governed by hydrodynamics of the solvent. However there is considerable evidence that internal dissipation of a polymer contributes as well. Here we investigate the dynamics of a single chain in the absence of solvent to characterize the nature of this internal friction. We model the chains as freely hinged but with localized bond angles and 3-fold symmetric dihedral angles. We show that the damping is close but not identical to Kelvin damping, which depends on the first temporal and second spatial derivative of monomer position. With no internal potential between monomers, the magnitude of the damping is small for long wavelengths and weakly damped oscillatory time dependent behavior is seen for a large range of spatial modes. When the size of the internal potential is increased, such oscillations persist, but the damping becomes larger. However underdamped motion is present even with quite strong dihedral barriers for long enough wavelengths.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The recently developed void expansion method (VEM) allows for an efficient generation of porous packings of spherical particles over a wide range of volume fractions. The method is based on a random placement of the structural particles under addition of much smaller "void-particles" whose radii are repeatedly increased during the void expansion. Thereby, they rearrange the structural particles until formation of a dense particle packing and introduce local heterogeneities in the structure. In this paper, microstructures with volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.6 produced by VEM are analyzed with respect to their degree of heterogeneity (DOH). In particular, the influence of the void- to structural particle number ratio, which constitutes a principal VEM-parameter, on the DOH is studied. The DOH is quantified using the pore size distribution, the Voronoi volume distribution and the density-fluctuation method in conjunction with fit functions or integral measures. This analysis has revealed that for volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.55 the void-particle number allows for a quasi-continuous adjustment of the DOH. Additionally, the DOH-range of VEM-generated microstructures with a volume fraction of 0.4 is compared to the range covered by microstructures generated using previous Brownian dynamics simulations, which represent the structure of coagulated colloidal suspensions. Both sets of microstructures cover similarly broad and overlapping DOH-ranges, which allows concluding that VEM is an efficient method to stochastically reproduce colloidal microstructures with varying DOH.</p>

    <p>Using $\vec{k}$$\cdot$$\vec{p}$ theory, we derive an effective four band model describing the physics of the typical two-dimensional topological insulator (HgTe/CdTe quantum well) in the presence of out-of-plane in z-direction inversion breaking and in-plane confining potentials. We find that up to third order in perturbation theory, only the inversion breaking potential generates new elements to the four band Hamiltonian that are off-diagonal in spin space. When this new effective Hamiltonian is folded into an effective two band model for the conduction (electron) or valence (heavy hole) bands, two competing terms appear: (1) a Rashba spin-orbit interaction originating from inversion breaking potential in z-direction and (2) an in-plane Pauli term as a consequence of the in-plane confining potential. Spin transport in the conduction band is further analysed within the Landauer-B√ºttiker formalism. We find that for asymmetrically doped HgTe quantum wells, the behaviour of the spin-Hall conductance is dominated by the Rashba term.</p>

    <p>We report the experimental and the analytical results of electron spin resonance (ESR) and magnetization in high magnetic fields up to about 68 T of the quasi two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$.
  From the temperature evolution of the ESR absorption linewidth, we find a distinct disturbing of the development of the spin correlation by $Z_2$-vortices between 23 K and 8.5 K. Below $T_{\rm{v}}=8.5$ K, spin-wave calculations based on a 57$^{\circ}$ spiral spin order well explains the frequency dependence of the ESR resonance fields and high field magnetization processes for $H$$\parallel$$c$ and $H$$\perp$$c$, although the magnetization for $H$$\perp$$c$ at high fields is different from the calculated one. Furthermore, we explain the field independent specific heat with $T^2$-dependence by the same spin-wave calculation, but the magnitude of the specific heat is much less than the observed one. Accordingly, these results suggest the occurrence of a $Z_2$ vortex-induced topological transition at $T_{\rm{v}}$ and may indicate quantum effects beyond the descriptions based on the above classical spin models.</p>

    <p>Dislocation assemblies exhibit a jamming or yielding transition at a critical external shear stress value $œÉ=œÉ_c$. Nevertheless the nature of this transition has not been ascertained. Here we study the heterogeneous and collective nature of dislocation dynamics within a crystal plasticity model close to $œÉ_c$, by considering the first-passage properties of the dislocation dynamics. As the transition is approached in the moving phase, the first passage time distribution exhibits scaling, and a related peak {\it dynamical} susceptibility $œá_4^*$ diverges as $œá_4^* \sim (œÉ-œÉ_c)^{-Œ±}$, with $Œ±\approx 1.1$. We relate this scaling to an avalanche description of the dynamics. While the static structural correlations are found to be independent of the external stress, we identify a diverging dynamical correlation length $Œæ_y$ in the direction perpendicular to the dislocation glide motion.</p>

    <p>We propose new semi-implicit numerical methods for the integration of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation with built-in angular momentum conservation. The performance of the proposed integrators is tested on the 1D Heisenberg chain. For this system, our schemes show better stability properties and allow us to use considerably larger time steps than standard explicit methods. At the same time, these semi-implicit schemes are also of comparable accuracy to and computationally much cheaper than the standard midpoint implicit method. The results are of key importance for atomistic spin dynamics simulations and the study of spin dynamics beyond the macro spin approximation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using a first-principle approach beyond density functional theory we calculate the electronic and optical properties of small diameter CdSe nanowires.Our results demonstrate how some approximations commonly used in bulk systems fail at this nano-scale level and how indispensable it is to include crystal local fields and excitonic effects to predict the unique optical properties of nanowires. From our results, we then construct a simple model that describes the optical gap as a function of the diameter of the wire, that turns out to be in excellent agreement with experiments for intermediate and large diameters.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The Hall effect, the anomalous Hall effect and the spin Hall effect are fundamental transport processes in solids arising from the Lorentz force and the spin-orbit coupling respectively. The quantum versions of the Hall effect and the spin Hall effect have been discovered in recent years. However, the quantized anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has not yet been realized experimentally. In a QAH insulator, spontaneous magnetic moments and spin-orbit coupling combine to give rise to a topologically non-trivial electronic structure, leading to the quantized Hall effect without any external magnetic field. In this work, based on state-of-art first principles calculations, we predict that the tetradymite semiconductors Bi$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ form magnetically ordered insulators when doped with transition metal elements (Cr or Fe), in sharp contrast to conventional dilute magnetic semiconductor where free carriers are necessary to mediate the magnetic coupling. Magnetic order in two-dimensional thin films gives rise to a topological electronic structure characterized by a finite Chern number, with quantized Hall conductance $e^{2}/h$. Experimental realization of the long sought-after QAH insulator state could enable robust dissipationless charge transport at room temperature.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We extend the recently-developed theory of bulk orbital magnetization to finite electric fields, and use it to calculate the orbital magnetoelectric response of periodic insulators. Working in the independent-particle framework, we find that the finite-field orbital magnetization can be written as a sum of three gauge-invariant contributions, one of which has no counterpart at zero field. The extra contribution is collinear with and explicitly dependent on the electric field. The expression for the orbital magnetization is suitable for first-principles implementations, allowing to calculate the magnetoelectric response coefficients by numerical differentiation. Alternatively, perturbation-theory techniques may be used, and for that purpose we derive an expression directly for the linear magnetoelectric tensor by taking the first field-derivative analytically. Two types of terms are obtained. One, the `Chern-Simons' term, depends only on the unperturbed occupied orbitals and is purely isotropic. The other, `Kubo' term, involves the first-order change in the orbitals and gives isotropic as well as anisotropic contributions to the response. In ordinary magnetoelectric insulators both terms are generally present, while in strong Z2 topological insulators only the former type is allowed, and is quantized. In order to validate the theory we have calculated under periodic boundary conditions the linear magnetoelectric coupling for a 3-D tight-binding model of an ordinary magnetoelectric insulator, using both the finite-field and perturbation-theory expressions. The results are in excellent agreement with calculations on bounded samples.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Magnetoelectric responses are a fundamental characteristic of materials that break time-reversal and inversion symmetries (notably multiferroics) and, remarkably, of "topological insulators" in which those symmetries are unbroken. Previous work has shown how to compute spin and lattice contributions to the magnetoelectric tensor. Here we solve the problem of orbital contributions by computing the frozen-lattice electronic polarization induced by a magnetic field. One part of this response (the "Chern-Simons term") can appear even in time-reversal-symmetric materials and has been previously shown to be quantized in topological insulators. In general materials there are additional orbital contributions to all parts of the magnetoelectric tensor; these vanish in topological insulators by symmetry and also vanish in several simplified models without time-reversal and inversion those magnetoelectric couplings were studied before. We give two derivations of the response formula, one based on a uniform magnetic field and one based on extrapolation of a long-wavelength magnetic field, and discuss some of the consequences of this formula.</p>

    <p>Heat engines provide most of our mechanical power and are essential for transportation on macroscopic scale. However, although significant progress has been made in the miniaturization of electrostatic engines, it has proven difficult to reduce the size of liquid or gas driven heat engines below 10^7 um^3. Here we demonstrate that a crystalline silicon structure operates as a cyclic piezoresistive heat engine when it is driven by a sufficiently high DC current. A 0.34 um^3 engine beam draws heat from the DC current using the piezoresistive effect and converts it into mechanical work by expansion and contraction at different temperatures. This mechanical power drives a silicon resonator of 1.1x10^3 um^3 into sustained oscillation. Even below the oscillation threshold the engine beam continues to amplify the resonator's Brownian motion. When its thermodynamic cycle is inverted, the structure is shown to reduce these thermal fluctuations, therefore operating as a refrigerator.</p>

    <p>We have studied a bulk electrolyte, and polyelectrolyte solutions with surfactants or multivalent salt with the explicit presence of counterions and solvent molecules by means of the mesoscopic dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method in the Grand Canonical ensemble. The electrostatic interactions are calculated using the Ewald sum method and the structure of the fluid is analyzed through the radial distribution function between charged particles. The results are in very good agreement with those reported in the literature using a different method for the calculation of the electrostatic forces, and with those obtained using DPD in the canonical ensemble. We also studied the salt dependent conformation of polyelectrolyte solutions as a function of the solvent quality, and analyzed the electrostatic interaction strength dependence of dilute flexible polyelectrolytes in solution. For the complex systems mentioned above, the electrostatic interactions and the solvent quality play a key role in understanding phenomena that do not occur in noncharged systems.</p>

    <p>Atomic vacancies have a strong impact in the mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties of graphene-like materials. By artificially generating isolated vacancies on a graphite surface and measuring their local density of states on the atomic scale, we have shown how single vacancies modify the electronic properties of this graphene-like system. Our scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, complemented by tight binding calculations, reveal the presence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around each single graphite vacancy, which can be associated with the formation of local magnetic moments and implies a dramatic reduction of the charge carriers' mobility. While vacancies in single layer graphene naturally lead to magnetic couplings of arbitrary sign, our results show the possibility of inducing a macroscopic ferrimagnetic state in multilayered graphene samples just by randomly removing single C atoms.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The magnetization of the prototypical molecular magnet Mn12-acetate exhibits a series of sharp steps at low temperatures due to quantum tunneling at specific resonant values of magnetic field applied along the easy c-axis. An abrupt reversal of the magnetic moment of such a crystal can also occur as an avalanche, where the spin reversal proceeds along a "deflagration" front that travels through the sample at subsonic speed. In this article we review experimental results that have been obtained for the ignition temperature and the speed of propagation of magnetic avalanches in molecular nanomagnets. Fits of the data with the theory of magnetic deflagration yield overall qualitative agreement. However, numerical discrepancies indicate that our understanding of these avalanches is incomplete.</p>

    <p>Magnetic correlations in the paramagnetic phase of CaFe2As2 (T_N=172 K) have been examined by means of inelastic neutron scattering from 180 K (~ 1.05 T_N) up to 300 K (~1.8 T_N). Despite the first-order nature of the magnetic ordering, strong but short-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations are clearly observed. These correlations, which consist of quasi-elastic scattering centered at the wavevector Q_{AFM} of the low-temperature AFM structure, are observed up to the highest measured temperature of 300 K and at high energy transfer (E> 60 meV). The L dependence of the scattering implies rather weak interlayer coupling in the tetragonal c-direction corresponding to nearly two-dimensional fluctuations in the (ab) plane. The spin correlation lengths within the Fe layer are found to be anisotropic, consistent with underlying fluctuations of the AFM stripe structure. Similar to the cobalt doped superconducting BaFe2As2 compounds, these experimental features can be adequately reproduced by a scattering model that describes short-range anisotropic spin correlations with overdamped spin dynamics.</p>

    <p>A self-consistent model is developed for the surface and bulk states of thin Y_{1-y}Ca_yBa_2Cu_3O_{7-Œ¥} (YCBCO) films. The dispersions of the chain and plane layers are modelled by tight-binding bands, and the electronic structure is then calculated for a finite-thickness film. The dopant atoms are treated within a virtual crystal approximation. Because YCBCO is a polar material, self-consistent treatment of the long range Coulomb interaction leads to a transfer of charge between the film surfaces, and to the formation of surface states. The tight binding band parameters are constrained by the requirement that the calculated band structure of surface states at CuO$_2$-terminated surfaces be in agreement with photoemission experiments. The spectral function and density of states are calculated and compared with experiments. Unlike the case of Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8, where the surfaces are believed to be representative of the bulk, the densities of states at the YCBCO surfaces are shown to be qualitatively different from the bulk, and are sensitive to doping. The calculated spectral function agrees closely with both bulk-sensitive and surface-sensitive photoemission results, while the calculated density of states for optimally-doped YCBCO agrees closely with tunneling experiments. We find that some density of states features previously ascribed to competing order can be understood as band structure effects.</p>

    <p>We demonstrate a new method of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) that is bulk sensitive, like traditional fluorescence yield measurements, but is not affected by self-absorption or saturation effects. This measure of XAS is achieved by scanning the incident photon energy through an absorption edge and using an energy sensitive photon detector to measure the partial fluorescence yield (PFY). The x-ray emission from any element or core-hole excitation that is not resonant with the absorption edge under investigation is selected from the PFY. It is found that the inverse of this PFY spectrum, which we term inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY), is linearly proportional to the x-ray absorption cross-section without any corrections due to saturation or self-absorption effects. We demonstrate this technique on the Cu L and Nd M absorption edges of the high-Tc cuprate LNSCO by measuring the O K PFY and comparing the total electron yield, total fluorescence yield and IPFY spectra.</p>

    <p>We have studied, both experimentally and theoretically, the change of the so-called 2D band of the Raman scattering spectrum of graphene (the two-phonon peak near 2700 cm-1) in an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the graphene crystal plane at liquid helium temperature. A shift to lower frequency and broadening of this band is observed as the magnetic field is increased from 0 to 33 T. At fields up to 5--10 T the changes are quadratic in the field while they become linear at higher magnetic fields. This effect is explained by the curving of the quasiclassical trajectories of the photo-excited electrons and holes in the magnetic field, which enables us (i) to extract the electron inelastic scattering rate, and (ii) to conclude that electronic scattering accounts for about half of the measured width of the 2D peak.</p>

Our study includes optimization of atomic structure, stability analysis based on the calculation of phonon dispersions, electronic structure and the variation of band gap with the width of the ribbon. The band gaps of silicon and germanium nanoribbons exhibit family behavior similar to those of graphene nanoribbons. The edges of bare nanoribbons are sharply reconstructed, which can be eliminated by the hydrogen termination of dangling bonds at the edges. Periodic modulation of the nanoribbon width results in a superlattice structure which can act as a multiple quantum wells. Specific electronic states are confined in these wells. Confinement trends are qualitatively explained by including the effects of the interface. In order to investigate wide and long superlattice structures we also performed empirical tight binding calculations with parameters determined from \textit{ab initio} calculations.</p>

In situ angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and ex situ transport measurements reveal that the as-grown Bi2Te3 films without any doping are an intrinsic topological insulator with its Fermi level intersecting only the metallic surface states. Experimentally, we find that the single-Dirac-cone surface state develops at a thickness of two quintuple layers (2 QL). Theoretically, we show that the interaction between the surface states from both sides of the film, which is determined by the penetration depth of the topological surface state wavefunctions, sets this lower thickness limit.</p>

    <p>Pariser-Parr-Pople (P-P-P) model Hamiltonian has been used extensively over the years to perform calculations of electronic structure and optical properties of $œÄ$-conjugated systems successfully. In spite of tremendous successes of \emph{ab initio} theory of electronic structure of large systems, the P-P-P model continues to be a popular one because of a recent resurgence in interest in the physics of $œÄ$-conjugated polymers, fullerenes and other carbon based materials. In this paper, we describe a Fortran 90 computer program developed by us, which uses P-P-P model Hamiltonian to not only solve Hartree-Fock (HF) equation for closed- and open-shell systems, but also for performing correlation calculations at the level of single configuration interactions (SCI) for molecular systems. Moreover, the code is capable of computing linear optical absorption spectrum at various levels, such as, tight binding (TB) Hueckel model, HF, SCI, and also of calculating the band structure using the Hueckel model. The code also allows the user to solve the HF equation in the presence of finite external electric field, thus, permitting calculations of quantities such as static polarizabilities and electro-absorption spectra. We demonstrate the capabilities of our code by performing calculations of various properties on conjugated systems such as $trans$-polyacetylene ($t$-PA), poly-\emph{para}-phenylene (PPP), poly-\emph{para}-phenylene-vinylene (PPV), \textit{oligo}-acenes, and graphene nanodisks.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Boron clusters have been widely studied theoretically for their geometrical properties and electronic structure using a variety of methodologies. An important cluster of boron is the B$_{12}$ cluster whose two main isomers have distinct geometries, namely, icosahedral ($I_{h}$) and quasi planar ($C_{3v}$). In this paper we investigate the linear optical absorption spectrum of these two B$_{12}$ structures with the aim of examining the role of geometry on the optical properties of clusters. The optical absorption calculations are performed using both the semi-empirical and the ab initio approaches. The semi-empirical approach uses a wave function methodology employing the INDO model Hamiltonian, coupled with large-scale configuration interaction (CI) calculations, to account for the electron-correlation effects. The \emph{ab initio} calculations are performed within a time-dependent-density-functional-theory (TDDFT) methodology. The results for the two approaches are in very good qualitative agreement with each other. Quantitatively speaking, results agree with each other in the lower energy region, while in the higher energy region, features predicted by the TDDFT approach are red-shifted as compared to the INDO-CI results. Both the approaches predict that the optical absorption begins at much lower energies in the icosahedral cluster as compared to the planar one, a fact which can be utilized in experiments to distinguish between the two geometries. At higher energies, both the isomers exhibit plasmon-like excitations. 73,1 4%</p>

    <p>We have observed large-amplitude coherent phonon oscillations of radial breathing modes (RBMs) in single-walled carbon nanotubes excited through the lowest-energy (E11) interband transitions. In contrast to the previously-studied coherent phonons excited through higher-energy (E22) transitions, these RBMs show comparable intensities between (n-m) mod 3 = 1 and -1 nanotubes. We also find novel non-resonantly excited RBMs over an excitation range of ~300 meV above the E11 transition, which we attribute to multi-phonon replicas arising from strong exciton-phonon coupling.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present ion beam erosion experiments performed in ultra high vacuum using a differentially pumped ion source and taking care that the ion beam hits the Si(001) sample only. Under these conditions no ion beam patterns form on Si for angles below 45 degrees with respect to the global surface normal using 2 keV Kr ions and fluences of 2 x 10^22 ions/m^2. In fact, the ion beam induces a smoothening of preformed patterns. Simultaneous sputter deposition of stainless steel in this angular range creates a variety of patterns, similar to those previously ascribed to clean ion beam induced destabilization of the surface profile. Only for grazing incidence with incident angles between 60 degrees and 83 degrees pronounced ion beam patterns form. It appears that the angular dependent stability of Si(001) against pattern formation under clean ion beam erosion conditions is related to the angular dependence of the sputtering yield, and not primarily to a curvature dependent yield as invoked frequently in continuum theory models.</p>

For increasing growth temperature we observe an enhancement of the electrical properties accompanied by an increased segregation of the phosphorous donors, resulting in a slight broadening of the delta-layer. We demonstrate that a step-flow growth achieved at 530 C provides the best compromise between high crystal quality and minimal dopant redistribution, with an electron mobility ~ 128 cm^2/Vs at a carrier density 1.3x10^14 cm-2, and a 4.2 K phase coherence length of ~ 180 nm.</p>

    <p>We explore multi-terminal quantum transport through a benzene molecule threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux $œÜ$. A simple tight-binding model is used to describe the system and all the calculations are done based on the Green's function formalism. With a brief description of two-terminal quantum transport, we present a detailed study of three-terminal transport properties through the benzene molecule to reveal the actual mechanism of electron transport. Here we numerically compute the multi-terminal conductances, reflection probabilities and current-voltage characteristics in the aspects of molecular coupling strength and magnetic flux $œÜ$. Most significantly we observe that, the molecular system where the benzene molecule is attached to three terminals can be operated as a transistor, and we call it a molecular transistor. This aspect can be utilized in designing nano-electronic circuits and our investigation may provide a basic framework to study electron transport in any complicated multi-terminal quantum system.</p>

We find that the internal quantum efficiency of such a device, if we choose an appropriate narrow-gap Mott insulator, can be significantly enhanced due to impact ionization caused by the photoexcited ``hot'' electron/hole pairs. Namely, the photoexcited electron and/or hole can convert its excess energy beyond the Mott-Hubbard gap to additional electrical energy by creating multiple electron/hole pairs in a time scale which can be shorter than the time characterizing other relaxation processes.</p>

    <p>Local structure of REOFeAs (RE=La, Pr, Nd, Sm) system has been studied as a function of chemical pressure varied due to different rare-earth size. Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements in the fluorescence mode has permitted to compare systematically the inter-atomic distances and their mean square relative displacements (MSRD). We find that the Fe-As bond length and the corresponding MSRD hardly show any change, suggesting the strongly covalent nature of this bond, while the Fe-Fe and Fe-RE bond lengths decrease with decreasing rare earth size. The results provide important information on the atomic correlations that could have direct implication on the superconductivity and magnetism of REOFeAs system, with the chemical pressure being a key ingredient.</p>

    <p>The plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles can enhance and direct light from optical emitters in much the same way that radio frequency (RF) antennas enhance and direct the emission from electrical circuits. In the RF regime, a typical antenna design for high directivity is the Yagi-Uda antenna, which basically consists of a one-dimensional array of antenna elements driven by a single feed element. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of directional light emission from a nano-optical Yagi-Uda antenna composed of an array of appropriately tuned gold nanorods.

This behavior is accompanied by non-Fermi-liquid behavior of e_g electrons and suggests using local moment variables in the effective model of iron. By investigating orbital-selective contributions to the Curie-Weiss law for Hund exchange I=0.9 eV we obtain an effective value of local moment of e_g electrons 2p=1.04 mu_B.

    <p>Sr2VO{3-delta}FeAs superconductors with different oxygen deficiencies have been successfully fabricated. It is found that the superconducting transition temperature drops down monotonically with the increase of oxygen deficiency. The diminishing of superconductivity is accompanied by the enhancement of residual resistivity, indicating an unraveled scattering effect induced by the oxygen deficiency. The highest superconducting transition temperature at about 40 K is achieved near the stoichiometrical sample Sr$_2$VO$_{3}$FeAs. Surprisingly, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the vanadium has a "5+" valence state in the samples. The Hall effect measurements reveal that the density of charge carriers (electron-like here) varies qualitatively with the increase of oxygen deficiency. Magnetotransport measurements show that the superconducting transition changes from one-step-like shape at low fields to two-step-like one at high fields, indicating a high anisotropy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A new method for calculation of band structure has been proposed based on the Green's function theory and local sampling. Potential energy in the Hamiltonian of Schrodinger's equation is approximated with a series of sampled Dirac delta functions weighted by appropriate factors. These factors are found from multipole expansion of atomic potentials in the crystal lattice, with considering effects such as screening. Fourier transform was then applied to describe the wave function in reciprocal space. Sampling can be uniform or non-uniform throughout space; however rate and interval optimization is essential. Theory was implemented for Silicon, Germanium and Graphene sheet individually, while results were compared with the ab-initio non-local pseudopotential (AINLPS) method. Also for Silicon, the pseudopotential used in orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) was employed as a suitable sampling source. Phase variations of the dispersion formula are analyzed, introducing adapting parameters to improve compatibility with ab-initio results. Local analysis with low order truncation in real space, reduces implementation time while giving acceptable results.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A zigzag graphene nanodisk can be interpreted as a quantum dot with an internal degree of freedom. It is well described by the infinite-range Heisenberg model. We have investigated its thermodynamical properties. There exists a quasi-phase transition between the quasi-ferromagnet and quasi-paramagnet states, as signaled by a sharp peak in the specific heat and in the susceptability. We have also analyzed how thermodynamical properties are affected when two leads are attached to the nanodisk. It is shown that lead effects are described by the many-spin Kondo Hamiltonian. There appears a new peak in the specific heat, and the multiplicity of the ground state becomes just one half of the system without leads. Another lead effect is to enhance the ferromagnetic order. Being a ferromagnet, a nanodisk can be used as a spin filter. Furthermore, since the relaxation time is finite, it is possible to control the spin of the nanodisk by an external spin current. We then propose a rich variety of spintronic devices made of nanodisks and leads, such as spin memory, spin amplifier, spin valve, spin-field-effect transistor, spin diode and spin logic gates such as spin-XNOR gate and spin-XOR gate. Graphene nanodisks could well be basic components of future nanoelectronic and spintronic devices.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Photonic and optoelectronic devices may offer the opportunity to realize efficient signal processing at speeds higher than in conventional electronic devices. Switches form the building blocks for circuits and fast photonic switches have been realized [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Recently, proof of principle of exciton optoelectronic devices was demonstrated [7,8]. Potential advantages of excitonic devices include high operation and interconnection speed, small dimensions, and the opportunity to combine many elements into integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate experimental proof of principle for the operation of excitonic switching devices at temperatures around 100 K. The devices are based on an AlAs/GaAs coupled quantum well structure and include the exciton optoelectronic transistor (EXOT), the excitonic bridge modulator (EXBM), and the excitonic pinch-off modulator (EXPOM). This is a two orders of magnitude increase in the operation temperature compared to the earlier devices, where operation was demonstrated at 1.5 K [7,8].</p>

    <p>Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 superconducting thin films have been grown on SrTiO3, (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3, LaAlO3 and YAlO3 (YAO) single crystal substrates by pulsed laser deposition. All the films, except on YAO, have been grown epitaxially without buffer layers. The films deposited on YAO contained 45 degree in-plane rotated grains and showed a broad superconducting transition. The onset Tc of the films is observed to increase from 16.2 K to 24.5 K with increasing c/a, mainly due to a slight distortion of the AsFe4 tetrahedron. From this correlation, we expect that higher superconducting transition temperatures than 24.5 K in a strained epitaxial film may be possible.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we study the relaxation dynamics of hot optical phonons in few-layer and multi-layer graphene films grown by epitaxy on silicon carbide substrates and by chemical vapor deposition on nickel substrates. In the first few hundred femtoseconds after photoexcitation, the hot carriers lose most of their energy to the generation of hot optical phonons which then present the main bottleneck to subsequent carrier cooling. Optical phonon cooling on short time scales is found to be independent of the graphene growth technique, the number of layers, and the type of the substrate. We find average phonon lifetimes in the 2.5-2.55 ps range. We model the relaxation dynamics of the coupled carrier-phonon system with rate equations and find a good agreement between the experimental data and the theory. The extracted optical phonon lifetimes agree very well with the theory based on anharmonic phonon interactions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We study the linear and nonlinear optical properties of wurtzite GaN under
c-axial stress field, using density functional theory calculations. The fully
structural optimization at each c-axial strain was performed. The calculated
dielectric functions show that tensile c-axial strain effectively improves the
linear optical efficiency, especially for the band-edge transitions, and
significantly increase the mobility of electrons in the conduction band.
Second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities show that the tensile c-axial
strain will enhance the zero- and low-frequency nonlinear responses of GaN. The
enhancement of the nonlinear optical property is explained by the reduction of
the polarization of wurtzite GaN under tensile c-axial strains. Based on these
findings, we propose a method for improving the electrical and optical
properties of the crystal through imposing appropriate stress on the high
symmetry crystalline directions.</p>

    <p>An effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ which differs from the bath temperature is believed to play an essential role in the theory of elasto-plasticity of amorphous solids. The definition of a measurable $T_{\rm eff}$ in the literature on sheared solids suffers however from being connected to a fluctuation-dissipation theorem which is correct only in equilibrium. Here we introduce a natural definition of $T_{\rm eff}$ based on measurable structural features without recourse to any questionable assumption. The value of $T_{\rm eff}$ is connected, using theory and scaling concepts, to the flow stress and the mean energy that characterize the elasto-plastic flow.</p>

    <p>We demonstrate a simple, low cost, magneto-transport method for rapidly characterizing the magnetic anisotropy and anisotropic magneto-resistance (AMR) of ferromagnetic devices with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. This transport technique is the analogue of magnetic susceptibility measurements of bulk material but is applicable to very small samples with low total moment. The technique is used to characterize devices fabricated from the dilute magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. The technique allows us to probe the behavior of the parameters close to the Curie temperature, in the limit of the applied magnetic field tending to zero. This avoids the complications arising from the presence of paramagnetism.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>By using the density functional theory method, we systematically study the influences of the doping of an Al atom on the electronic structures of the Mg(0001) surface and dissociation behaviors of H2 molecules. We find that for the Al-doped surfaces, the surface relaxation around the doping layer changes from expansion of a clean Mg(0001) surface to contraction, due to the redistribution of electrons. After doping, the work function is enlarged, and the electronic states around the Fermi energy have a major distribution around the doping layer. For the dissociation of H2 molecules, we find that the energy barrier is enlarged for the doped surfaces. Especially, when the Al atom is doped at the first layer, the energy barrier is enlarged by 0.30 eV. For different doping lengths, however, the dissociation energy barrier decreases slowly to the value on a clean Mg(0001) surface when the doping layer is far away from the top surface. Our results well describe the electronic changes after Al-doping for the Mg(0001) surface, and reveal some possible mechanisms for improving the resistance to corrosion of the Mg(0001) surface by doping of Al atoms.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Thermal-magnetic noise at ferromagnetic resonance (T-FMR) can be used to measure magnetic perpendicular anisotropy of nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). For this purpose, T-FMR measurements were conducted with an external magnetic field up to 14 kOe applied perpendicular to the film surface of MgO-based MTJs under a dc bias. The observed frequency-field relationship suggests that a 20 A CoFeB free layer has an effective demagnetization field much smaller than the intrinsic bulk value of CoFeB, with 4PiMeff = (6.1 +/- 0.3) kOe. This value is consistent with the saturation field obtained from magnetometry measurements on extended films of the same CoFeB thickness. In-plane T-FMR on the other hand shows less consistent results for the effective demagnetization field, presumably due to excitations of more complex modes. These experiments suggest that the perpendicular T-FMR is preferred for quantitative magnetic characterization of nanoscale MTJs.</p>

    <p>Time-and-frequency resolved pump-probe optical spectroscopy is used to investigate the effect of the impulsive injection of delocalized excitations through a charge-transfer process in insulating CuGeO3. A large broadening of the charge-transfer edge is observed on the sub-ps timescale. The modification of this spectral feature can not be attributed to the local increase of the effective temperature, as a consequence of the energy absorbed by the pump pulse. The measured modifications of the optical properties of the system are consistent with the creation of a non-thermal state, metastable on the ps timescale, after the pump-induced impulsive modification of the electron interactions.</p>

    <p>We report a direct current transport study of the local intergrain connections in a polycrystalline SmFeAsO0.85 (Sm1111) bulk, for which we earlier estimated significant intergranular critical current density Jc. Our combined low temperature laser scanning microscopy (LTLSM) and scanning electron microscopy observations revealed only few grain-to-grain transport current paths, most of which switched off when a magnetic field was applied. These regions typically occur where current crosses Fe-As, which is a normal-metal wetting-phase that surrounds Sm1111 grains, producing a dense array of superconducting-normal-superconducting contacts. Our study points out the need to reduce the amount of grain boundary-wetting Fe-As phase, as well as the crack density within pnictide grains, as these defects produce a multiply connected current-blocking network.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present an experimental and theoretical study of the magnetic field dependence of the mode frequency of thermally excited spin waves in rectangular shaped nanopillars of lateral sizes 60x100, 75x150, and 105x190 nm2, patterned from MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions. The spin wave frequencies were measured using spectrally resolved electrical noise measurements. In all spectra, several independent quantized spin wave modes have been observed and could be identified as eigenexcitations of the free layer and of the synthetic antiferromagnet of the junction. Using a theoretical approach based on the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix of a system of three coupled, spatially confined magnetic layers, we have modeled the spectra for the smallest pillar and have extracted its material parameters. The magnetization and exchange stiffness constant of the CoFeB free layer are thereby found to be substantially reduced compared to the corresponding thin film values. Moreover, we could infer that the pinning of the magnetization at the lateral boundaries must be weak. Finally, the interlayer dipolar coupling between the free layer and the synthetic antiferromagnet causes mode anticrossings with gap openings up to 2 GHz. At low fields and in the larger pillars, there is clear evidence for strong non-uniformities of the layer magnetizations. In particular, at zero field the lowest mode is not the fundamental mode, but a mode most likely localized near the layer edges.</p>

The c-axis lattice constant decreases significantly with increasing P content, suggesting a remarkable chemical pressure. The Fe-3d electrons show the enhanced metallic behavior upon P-doping and undergo a magnetic quantum phase transition around $x \approx 0.4$. Meanwhile, the Ce-4f electrons develop a ferromagnetic order near the same doping level. The ferromagnetic order is vanishingly small around $x=0.9$. The data suggest a heavy-fermion-like behavior as $x\geq 0.95$. No superconductivity is observed down to 2 K. Our results show the ferromagnetic ordered state as an intermediate phase intruding between the antiferromagnetic bad metal and the nonmagnetic heavy fermion metal and support the cerium-containing iron pnictides as a unique layered Kondo lattice system.</p>

    <p>Magnetic nanoparticles of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) manganite with mean particle sizes of 13, 16, 18 and 21 nm were prepared by the sol-gel method. The crystal structure and mean particle size of the synthesized powders were estimated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using rietveld refinement and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission spectroscopy revealed that stretching and bending modes are influenced by calcinations temperature. Dc magnetization versus magnetic field of the samples was carried out at room temperature. Magnetic dynamics of the samples was studied by the measurement of ac magnetic susceptibility versus temperature at different frequencies and ac magnetic fields. A frequency-dependent peak was observed in ac magnetic susceptibility versus temperature which is well described by Vogel-Fulcher and critical slowing down laws, and empirical and parameters. By fitting the experimental data with Vogel-Fulcher and critical slowing down laws, the relaxation time, characteristic temperature, magnetic anisotropy energy, effective magnetic anisotropy constant and critical exponent zv have been estimated. The obtained values of c1, c2, T0 and t0 from the Vogel-Fulcher law support of the presence of strong interaction between magnetic nanoparticles. The values of zv and t0 obtained from critical slowing down fit suggest the presence of superspin glass behavior in LSMO nanoparticles of different sizes.</p>

An alternative scheme that modifies the exchange, not Hartree, energy is proposed as a remedy. We show that our LDA+$U$ approach reproduces the expected degeneracy of $f^1$ and $f^2$ states in free ions and the correct ground states in solid PrO$_2$. We expect our method to be useful in studying compounds of $f$- and heavy-$d$ elements.</p>

    <p>We study ferroelectricity in thin films of pseudo-proper ferroelectrics such as the so-called spiral multiferroics. We find that this type of ferroelectricity stands better against depolarizing fields than conventional one. Its single-domain state can be easily preserved by metallic electrodes even in ultrathin films. In fact, single-domain ferroelectricty can be generated as a metastable state in the absence of electrodes. We also find a new regime of small thickness where unscreened films develop unusual multi-domain states with properties determined by non-electrostatic boundary conditions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Deep inelastic neutron scattering experiments using indirect time-of-flight spectrometers have reported a smaller cross section for the hydrogen atom than expected from conventional scattering theory. Typically, at large momentum transfers, a deficit of 20-40% in the neutron scattering intensity has been measured and several theories have been developed to explain these results. We present a different approach to this problem by investigating the hydrogen cross section in polyethylene using the direct geometry time-of-flight spectrometer MARI with the incident energy fixed at a series of values ranging from Ei=0.5 eV to 100 eV. These measurements span a much broader range in momentum than previous studies and with varying energy resolutions. We observe no momentum dependence to the cross section with an error of 4% and through a comparison with the scattering from metal foil standards measure the absolute bound cross section of the hydrogen atom to be sigma(H)= 80 +/- 4 barns. These results are in agreement with conventional scattering theory but contrast with theories invoking quantum entanglement and neutron experiments supporting them. Our results also illustrate a unique use of direct geometry chopper instruments at high incident energies and demonstrate their capability for conducting high-energy spectroscopy.</p>

    <p>We investigate the phase behaviour of a system of particles interacting through the exp-6 pair potential, a model interaction that is appropriate to describe effective interatomic forces under high compression. The soft-repulsive component of the potential is being varied so as to study the effect on reentrant melting and density anomaly. Upon increasing the repulsion softness, we find that the anomalous melting features persist and occur at smaller pressures. Moreover, if we reduce the range of downward concavity in the potential by extending the hard core at the expenses of the soft-repulsive shoulder, the reentrant part of the melting line reduces in extent so as it does the region of density anomaly.</p>

Due to its proximity to the spin-orbit insulator phase, the magnetic ordering as obtained with finite $U$ is found to exhibit a strong in-plane anisotropy.

We show that for weakly coupled semiconducting grains the figure of merit is optimized for grain sizes of order 5nm for typical materials and its values can be larger than one.

In this compound, very large slopes of $Œº_{0}H_{\rm c2}$ at the onset, the mid-point, the zero-resistivity temperatures on superconductivity are determined to be -13.7, -10.1, and -6.9 T/K, respectively. The observed $Œº_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T)$s of this compound are considerably smaller than those expected from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, manifesting the Pauli limiting behavior.

    <p>Films composed of nanotube networks have their conductivities regulated by the junction resistances formed between tubes. Conductivity values are enhanced by lower junction resistances but should reach a maximum that is limited by the network morphology. By considering ideal ballistic-like contacts between nanotubes we use the Kubo formalism to calculate the upper bound for the conductivity of such films and show how it depends on the nanotube concentration as well as on their aspect ratio. Highest measured conductivities reported so far are approaching this limiting value, suggesting that further progress lies with nanowires other than nanotubes.</p>

    <p>Correlated materials are extremely sensitive to external stimuli, such as temperature or pressure. Describing the electronic properties of such systems often requires applying many-body techniques to effective low energy problems in the spirit of the Hubbard model, or extensions thereof. While the effect of pressure on structures and bands has been investigated extensively within density-functional based methods, the pressure dependence of electron-electron interactions has so far received little attention. As a step toward ab initio pressure studies for realistic systems within a setup of maximally localized Wannier functions and the constrained random phase approximation, we examine in this paper the paradigmatic pressure dependence of Coulomb interactions. While compression commonly causes the "extension" of Wannier functions, and thus transfer elements, to grow, we find the -- seemingly counter-intuitive -- tendency that the bare Coulomb interaction increases under compression as well. We reconcile these behaviors by appealing to a semi-analytical tight-binding model. We moreover argue that, for this model, the requirement of maximal Wannier localization is equivalent to maximizing the Coulomb interaction matrix elements. We then apply the above first principles techniques to fcc hydrogen under pressure. While we find our comprehension of the bare Coulomb interaction confirmed, the induced changes in screening strengths lead to an effective one band model with a Hubbard interaction that is non-monotonous under pressure.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Free energy of crystal phases is commonly evaluated by thermodynamic
integration (TDI) along a reversible path that involves an external potential.
A persistent problem in this method is that a significant hysteresis is
observed due to differences in the center of mass position of the crystal phase
in the presence and absence of the external potential. To alleviate this
hysteresis, a constraint on the translational degrees of freedom of the crystal
phase is imposed along the path and subsequently a correction term is added to
the free energy to account for such a constraint. In this work, we propose a
new methodology termed as error-biased Bennett Acceptance ratio (EBAR) method
that effectively solves this problem without the need to impose any constraint.
This method is simple to implement as it does not require any modification to
the path or to the simulation code. We show the applicability of this method in
the computation of crystal-melt interfacial energy by cleaving wall method [J.
Chem. Phys., 118, 7651 (2003)] and bulk crystal-melt free energy difference by
constrained fluid $\lambda$-integration method [J. Chem. Phys., 120, 2122

    <p>The shear rate dependence of the slip length in thin polymer films confined between atomically flat surfaces is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The polymer melt is described by the bead-spring model of linear flexible chains. We found that at low shear rates the velocity profiles acquire a pronounced curvature near the wall and the absolute value of the negative slip length is approximately equal to thickness of the viscous interfacial layer. At higher shear rates, the velocity profiles become linear and the slip length increases rapidly as a function of shear rate. The gradual transition from no-slip to steady-state slip flow is associated with faster relaxation of the polymer chains near the wall evaluated from decay of the time autocorrelation function of the first normal mode. We also show that at high melt densities the friction coefficient at the interface between the polymer melt and the solid wall follows power law decay as a function of the slip velocity. At large slip velocities the friction coefficient is determined by the product of the surface induced peak in the structure factor, temperature and the contact density of the first fluid layer near the solid wall.</p>

    <p>Starting from the multiorbital Hubbard model for the t2g-bands of RTiO3 (R= Y, Gd, Sm, and La), where all parameters have been derived from the first-principles calculations, we construct an effective superexchange (SE) spin model, by treating transfer integrals as a perturbation. We consider four approximations for the SE interactions: (i) the canonical crystal-field (CF) theory, where the form of the the occupied t2g-orbitals is dictated by the CF splitting, and three extensions, namely (ii) the relativistic one, where occupied orbitals are confined within the lowest Kramers doublet obtained from the diagonalization of the crystal field and relativistic spin-orbit (SO) interactions; (iii) the finite-temperature extension, which consider the effect of thermal orbital fluctuations near the CF configuration; (iv) the many-electron extension, which is based on the diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian constructed in the basis of two-electron states separately for each bond of the system. The main results are summarized as follows. (i) Thermal fluctuations of the orbital degrees of freedom can substantially reduce the value of the magnetic transition temperature. (ii) The anisotropic and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions are rigorously derived and their implications to the magnetic properties are discussed. (iii) The CF theory, although applicable for YTiO3 and high-temperature structures of GdTiO3 and SmTiO3, breaks down in LaTiO3. Instead, the combination of the many-electron effects and SO interaction can be responsible for the AFM character of interatomic correlations in LaTiO3. (iv) The SE interactions in YTiO3 strongly depend on the details of the crystal structure. Distortions in the low-temperature structure tend to weaken the ferromagnetic interactions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Unlike charge and spin, the orbital degree of freedom of electrons in transition metal oxides is difficult to detect. We present the theoretical study of a new detection method in metallic orbitally active systems by analyzing the quasiparticle scattering interference (QPI) pattern of the spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling spectroscopy, which is sensitive to orbital structures and orbital ordering. The QPIs for the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$-orbital bands in the $t_{2g}$-orbital systems show a characteristic stripe-like feature as a consequence of their quasi-one-dimensional nature, which is robust against orbital hybridization. With the occurrence of orbital ordering proposed in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and iron-pnictides, the stripe-like QPI patterns exhibit nematic distortion breaking the $C_4$-symmetry.</p>

    <p>Whispering Gallery modes in bulk cylindrical Gallium Arsenide and Gallium Phosphide samples have been examined both in darkness and under white light at 50 K. In both samples we observed change in permittivity under light and dark conditions. This results from a change in the polarization state of the semiconductor, which is consistent with a free electron-hole creation/recombination process. The permittivity of the semiconductor is modified by free photocarriers in the surface layers of the sample which is the region sampled by Whispering Gallery modes.</p>

    <p>The spatial distribution of structural relaxation in a supercooled liquid is studied using molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D binary mixture. It is shown that the spatial heterogeneity of the relaxation along with the time scale of the relaxation is determined, not by the frequency with which particles move a distance pi/2kBragg, but by the frequency with which particles can achieve persistent displacements. We show that these persistent displacements are achieved through the coupled action of local reorganizations and unrecoverable thermal strains.</p>

    <p>The solid solution Ga1-xGexV4S8 (x = 0 - 1) was synthesized by solid state reactions and characterized by temperature-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and static magnetic susceptibility measurements. The compounds crystallize in the cubic GaMo4S8-type structure (space group F-43m), built up by heterocubane-like [V4S4](5-x)+ cubes and [Ga1-xGexS4](5-x)- tetrahedra arranged in a NaCl-like manner. The successive substitution of Ga3+ by Ge4+ increases the electron count in the molecular orbital (MO) of the V4-cluster gradually from seven to eight. We observe an almost linear increase of the magnetic moments, connected with a transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering around x <= 0.5. Remarkably, the low temperature structural phase transitions as known from the ternary compounds were also detected in the solid solution. The gallium-rich compounds (0 < x < 0.5) undergo rhombohedral distortions like GaV4S8 (space group R3m), whereas distortions to orthorhombic symmetry (space group Imm2) as known from GeV4S8 occur in the germanium-rich part of the solid solution (0.5 <= x < 1).</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Here a recently observed weak first order transition in doped SrTiO3 is argued to be a consequence of the coupling between strain and order parameter fluctuations. Starting with a semi-microscopic action, and using renormalization group equations for vertices, we write the free energy of such a system. This fluctuation renormalized free energy is then used to discuss the possibility of first order transition at zero temperature as well as at finite temperature. An asymptotic analysis predicts small but a finite discontinuity in the order parameter near a mean field quantum critical point at zero temperature. In case of finite temperature transition, near quantum critical point such a possibility is found to be extremely weak. Results are in accord with some experimental findings on quantum paraelectrics such as SrTiO3 and KTaO3.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Upon cooling, branched line defects develop in epitaxial graphene grown at high temperature on Pt(111) and Ir(111). Using atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy we demonstrate that these defects are wrinkles in the graphene layer, i.e. stripes of partially delaminated graphene. With low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) we investigate the wrinkling phenomenon in situ. Upon temperature cycling we observe hysteresis in the appearance and disappearance of the wrinkles. Simultaneously with wrinkle formation a change in bright field imaging intensity of adjacent areas and a shift in the moire spot positions for micro diffraction of such areas takes place. The stress relieved by wrinkle formation results from the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of graphene and the substrate. A simple one-dimensional model taking into account the energies related to strain, delamination and bending of graphene is in qualitative agreement with our observations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Spontaneous emission (SE) from a two-level atom in a photonic crystal (PC) with anisotropic one-band model is investigated using the fractional calculus. Analytically solving the kinetic equation in terms of the fractional exponential function, the dynamical discrepancy of SE between the anisotropic and isotropic systems is discussed on the basis of different photon density of states (DOS) and the existence of incoherent diffusion field that becomes even more clearly as the atomic transition frequency lies close to the band edge. With the same atom-field coupling strength and detuning in the forbidden gap, the photon-atom bound states in the isotropic system turn into the unbound ones in the anisotropic system that is consistent with the experimental observation in $Phys.$ $Rev.$ $Lett.$ \textbf{96}, 243902 (2006). Dynamics along different wavevectors with various curvatures of dispersion is also addressed with the changes of the photon DOS and the appearance of the diffusion fields.</p>

    <p>We use spin torque ferromagnetic resonance to measure the spectral properties of dipole-exchange spin waves in permalloy nanowires. Our measurements reveal that geometric confinement has a profound effect on the damping of spin waves in the nanowire geometry. The damping parameter of the lowest-energy quantized spin wave mode depends on applied magnetic field in a resonant way and exhibits a maximum at a field that increases with decreasing nanowire width. This enhancement of damping originates from a nonlinear resonant three-magnon confluence process allowed at a particular bias field value determined by quantization of the spin wave spectrum in the nanowire geometry.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Reduced Bloch mode expansion is presented for fast periodic media band
structure calculations. The expansion employs a natural basis composed of a
selected reduced set of Bloch eigenfunctions. The reduced basis is selected
within the irreducible Brillouin zone at high symmetry points determined by the
medium's crystal structure and group theory (and possibly at additional related
points). At each of the reciprocal lattice selection points, a number of Bloch
eigenfunctions are selected up to the frequency range of interest for the band
structure calculations. Since it is common to initially discretize the periodic
unit cell and solution field using some choice of basis, reduced Bloch mode
expansion is practically a secondary expansion that uses a selected set of
Bloch eigenvectors. Such expansion therefore keeps, and builds on, any
favorable attributes a primary expansion approach might exhibit. Being in line
with the well known concept of modal analysis, the proposed approach maintains
accuracy while reducing the computation time by up to two orders of magnitudes
or more depending on the size and extent of the calculations. Results are
presented for phononic, photonic and electronic band structures.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Over the last two decades, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has become
one of the most important ways to investigate the structure of crystal
surfaces. STM has helped achieve remarkable successes in surface science such
as finding the atomic structure of Si(111) and Si(001). For high-index Si
surfaces the information about the local density of states obtained by scanning
does not translate directly into knowledge about the positions of atoms at the
surface. A commonly accepted strategy for identifying the atomic structure is
to propose several possible models and analyze their corresponding {\em
simulated} STM images for a match with the experimental ones. However, the
number of good candidates for the lowest-energy structure is very large for
high-index surfaces, and heuristic approaches are not likely to cover all the
relevant structural models. In this article, we take the view that finding the
atomic structure of a surface is a problem of stochastic optimization, and we
address it as such. We design a general technique for predicting the
reconstruction of silicon surfaces with arbitrary orientation, which is based
on parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations combined with an exponential
cooling. The advantages of the method are illustrated using the Si(105) surface
as example, with two main results: (a) the correct single-step rebonded
structure [e.g., Fujikawa {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 176101 (2002)] is
obtained even when starting from the paired-dimer model [Mo {\em et al.}, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 65, 1020 (1990)] that was assumed to be correct for many years, and
(b) we have found several double-step reconstructions that have lower surface
energies than any previously proposed double-step models.</p>
