    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation
temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge
in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework
based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design
of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property
prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to
directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that
satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally
validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs.
Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a
high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work
output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal
hysteresis of 29 {\deg}C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced
performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a
finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf
diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This
study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable
route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery
and engineering innovation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
knowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel
materials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world
applications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and
experiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space,
minimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide
an accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the
integration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials
structures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge
from literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG
in accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic
review to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key
materials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal
structure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining,
database integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining
LLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the
performance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline
future directions for leveraging LLMs to accelerate materials research and
discovery for advancement in technologies in the area of electronics, optics,
biomedical, and energy storage.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Weaving as an old craft has extensive applications in modern science and
technology such as smart textiles and intelligent soft robots. However, weaving
irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring
curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple
strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags',
a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of
straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the
fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these
local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric
frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar & hinge model to simulate the
mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how
the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's
modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where
an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag
patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces
including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows,
respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave
the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft
robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling
new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their
application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly
multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present
a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature
from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and
materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials.
We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and
Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and
adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model
(BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a
Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and
translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference
protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query,
surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach
through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,
and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the
fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and
measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived
adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive
real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.</p>
