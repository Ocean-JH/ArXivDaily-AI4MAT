    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Inorganic crystal materials have broad application potential due to excellent
physical and chemical properties, with elastic properties (shear modulus, bulk
modulus) crucial for predicting materials' electrical conductivity, thermal
conductivity and mechanical properties. Traditional experimental measurement
suffers from high cost and low efficiency, while theoretical simulation and
graph neural network-based machine learning methods--especially crystal graph
convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs)--have become effective alternatives,
achieving remarkable results in predicting material elastic properties. This
study trained two CGCNN models using shear modulus and bulk modulus data of
10987 materials from the Matbench v0.1 dataset, which exhibit high accuracy
(mean absolute error <13, coefficient of determination R-squared close to 1)
and good generalization ability. Materials were screened to retain those with
band gaps between 0.1-3.0 eV and exclude radioactive element-containing
compounds. The final predicted dataset comprises two parts: 54359 crystal
structures from the Materials Project database and 26305 crystal structures
discovered by Merchant et al. (2023 Nature 624 80). Ultimately, this study
completed the prediction of shear modulus and bulk modulus for 80664 inorganic
crystals. This work enriches existing material elastic data resources and
provides robust support for material design, with all data openly available at

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topological materials--including insulators (TIs) and semimetals (TSMs)--hold
immense promise for quantum technologies, yet their discovery remains
constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and
the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Here, we
introduce TXL Fusion, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates
chemical heuristics, engineered physical descriptors, and large language model
(LLM) embeddings to accelerate the discovery of topological materials. By
incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron
configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies
materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and
generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully
identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through
density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By
uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid
and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a
scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological
and quantum materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is
a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of
solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional
approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations,
which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We
introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic
dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized
contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free
generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations
of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing
accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results
highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these
objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of
frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.</p>
