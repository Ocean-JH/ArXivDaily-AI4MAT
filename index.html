    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The increasing complexity and volume of data generated by high-throughput
computational materials science require robust tools to ensure their
accessibility, reproducibility, and reuse. In particular, integrating the FAIR
Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) into
computational workflows is essential to enable open science practices. TribChem
is an open source Python software developed for the automated simulation of
solid-solid interfaces using density functional theory (DFT). While TribChem
already incorporates several FAIR-aligned features, we present here a dedicated
FAIR utility designed to transform TribChem results into FAIR-compliant
datasets. This utility comprises two tools: fair_data.py, which automatically
generates standardized machine- and human-readable outputs from the TribChem
database, and retrieve_data.py, which facilitates efficient data extraction
through a keyword-based interface. In this paper we show the capabilities of
the fair utility with examples for bulk, surface, and interface systems. The
implementation allows seamless integration with public repositories such as
Zenodo, paving the way for reproducible research and fostering data-driven
materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding
challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property
relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable
models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density
$w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a
minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated
dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed
Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from
available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we
systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using
combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final
closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive
accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while
maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design
maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and
$P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive
elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type
hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite
trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare
candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to
the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models
indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching
these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for
materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery
of materials in complex chemical spaces.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.</p>
