    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Stable diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art in data synthesis
across diverse domains and hold transformative potential for applications in
science and engineering, e.g., by facilitating the discovery of novel solutions
and simulating systems that are computationally intractable to model
explicitly. While there is increasing effort to incorporate physics-based
constraints into generative models, existing techniques are either limited in
their applicability to latent diffusion frameworks or lack the capability to
strictly enforce domain-specific constraints. To address this limitation this
paper proposes a novel integration of stable diffusion models with constrained
optimization frameworks, enabling the generation of outputs satisfying
stringent physical and functional requirements. The effectiveness of this
approach is demonstrated through material design experiments requiring
adherence to precise morphometric properties, challenging inverse design tasks
involving the generation of materials inducing specific stress-strain
responses, and copyright-constrained content generation tasks. All code has
been released at

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing
crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns,
particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding
task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information,
multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to
potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease
humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven
Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust
identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara
performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within
a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld
refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering,
automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion,
peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When
ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided
between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing
the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable
analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for
integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully
self-driving materials discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing heterogeneous catalysis research
by accelerating simulations and materials discovery. A key frontier is
integrating AI with multiscale models and multimodal experiments to address the
"many-to-one" challenge of linking intrinsic kinetics to observables. Advances
in machine-learned force fields, microkinetics, and reactor modeling enable
rapid exploration of chemical spaces, while operando and transient data provide
unprecedented insight. Yet, inconsistent data quality and model complexity
limit mechanistic discovery. Generative and agentic AI can automate model
generation, quantify uncertainty, and couple theory with experiment, realizing
"self-driving models" that produce interpretable, reproducible, and
transferable understanding of catalytic systems.</p>
