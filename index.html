    <p>Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide
materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics,
including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and
photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped
excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that
localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice
distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures
the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material
design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton
(STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the
interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light
emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality,
connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl
in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal
electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations,
such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice
dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without
compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion
mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for
tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with
enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Scientific hypothesis generation is central to materials discovery, yet
current approaches often emphasize either conceptual (idea-to-data) reasoning
or data-driven (data-to-idea) analysis, rarely achieving an effective
integration of both. Here, we present a generalizable active learning workflow
that integrates top-down, theory-driven hypothesis generation, guided by a
large language model. This is complemented by bottom-up, data-driven hypothesis
testing through a root-cause association study. We demonstrate this approach
through the design of equimolar quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite, a
chemically complex system with over 850,000 possible cation combinations. In
the top-down component, the large language model drives closed-loop
optimization by proposing candidates that are likely to achieve phase purity,
leveraging domain knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning. With each
iteration, the model identifies an increasing number of near phase-pure
compositions, sampling less than 0.004% of the design space. In parallel, the
bottom-up association study identifies molecular features with statistically
significant influences on phase purity. The integration of these approaches
enables the convergence of conceptual and statistical hypotheses, leading to
generalizable and rational design rules for phase-pure quinary-cation
two-dimensional perovskites. As a proof of concept, we applied the optimized
phase-pure quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite film as a surface capping
layer in perovskite solar cells, achieving good performance and stability. Our
framework enables the development of interpretable and generalizable design
rules that are applicable to a wide range of optimization processes within
complex design spaces, providing a foundational strategy for rational,
scalable, and efficient materials discovery.</p>
