    <p>Noncentrosymmetric materials play a critical role in many important applications such as laser technology, communication systems,quantum computing, cybersecurity, and etc. However, the experimental discovery of new noncentrosymmetric materials is extremely difficult. Here we present a machine learning model that could predict whether the composition of a potential crystalline structure would be centrosymmetric or not. By evaluating a diverse set of composition features calculated using matminer featurizer package coupled with different machine learning algorithms, we find that Random Forest Classifiers give the best performance for noncentrosymmetric material prediction, reaching an accuracy of 84.8% when evaluated with 10 fold cross-validation on the dataset with 82,506 samples extracted from Materials Project. A random forest model trained with materials with only 3 elements gives even higher accuracy of 86.9%. We apply our ML model to screen potential noncentrosymmetric materials from 2,000,000 hypothetical materials generated by our inverse design engine and report the top 20 candidate noncentrosymmetric materials with 2 to 4 elements and top 20 borate candidates</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Generative models trained on internet-scale data are capable of generating novel and realistic texts, images, and videos. A natural next question is whether these models can advance science, for example by generating novel stable materials. Traditionally, models with explicit structures (e.g., graphs) have been used in modeling structural relationships in scientific data (e.g., atoms and bonds in crystals), but generating structures can be difficult to scale to large and complex systems. Another challenge in generating materials is the mismatch between standard generative modeling metrics and downstream applications. For instance, common metrics such as the reconstruction error do not correlate well with the downstream goal of discovering stable materials. In this work, we tackle the scalability challenge by developing a unified crystal representation that can represent any crystal structure (UniMat), followed by training a diffusion probabilistic model on these UniMat representations. Our empirical results suggest that despite the lack of explicit structure modeling, UniMat can generate high fidelity crystal structures from larger and more complex chemical systems, outperforming previous graph-based approaches under various generative modeling metrics. To better connect the generation quality of materials to downstream applications, such as discovering novel stable materials, we propose additional metrics for evaluating generative models of materials, including per-composition formation energy and stability with respect to convex hulls through decomposition energy from Density Function Theory (DFT). Lastly, we show that conditional generation with UniMat can scale to previously established crystal datasets with up to millions of crystals structures, outperforming random structure search (the current leading method for structure discovery) in discovering new stable materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>There is growing interest in engineering unconventional computing devices that leverage the intrinsic dynamics of physical substrates to perform fast and energy-efficient computations. Granular metamaterials are one such substrate that has emerged as a promising platform for building wave-based information processing devices with the potential to integrate sensing, actuation, and computation. Their high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics result in nontrivial and sometimes counter-intuitive wave responses that can be shaped by the material properties, geometry, and configuration of individual grains. Such highly tunable rich dynamics can be utilized for mechanical computing in special-purpose applications. However, there are currently no general frameworks for the inverse design of large-scale granular materials. Here, we build upon the similarity between the spatiotemporal dynamics of wave propagation in material and the computational dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks to develop a gradient-based optimization framework for harmonically driven granular crystals. We showcase how our framework can be utilized to design basic logic gates where mechanical vibrations carry the information at predetermined frequencies. We compare our design methodology with classic gradient-free methods and find that our approach discovers higher-performing configurations with less computational effort. Our findings show that a gradient-based optimization method can greatly expand the design space of metamaterials and provide the opportunity to systematically traverse the parameter space to find materials with the desired functionalities.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Predictive materials synthesis is the primary bottleneck in realizing new functional and quantum materials. Strategies for synthesis of promising materials are currently identified by time-consuming trial and error approaches and there are no known predictive schemes to design synthesis parameters for new materials. We use reinforcement learning to predict optimal synthesis schedules, i.e. a time-sequence of reaction conditions like temperatures and reactant concentrations, for the synthesis of a prototypical quantum material, semiconducting monolayer MoS$_{2}$, using chemical vapor deposition. The predictive reinforcement leaning agent is coupled to a deep generative model to capture the crystallinity and phase-composition of synthesized MoS$_{2}$ during CVD synthesis as a function of time-dependent synthesis conditions. This model, trained on 10000 computational synthesis simulations, successfully learned threshold temperatures and chemical potentials for the onset of chemical reactions and predicted new synthesis schedules for producing well-sulfidized crystalline and phase-pure MoS$_{2}$, which were validated by computational synthesis simulations. The model can be extended to predict profiles for synthesis of complex structures including multi-phase heterostructures and can also predict long-time behavior of reacting systems, far beyond the domain of the MD simulations used to train the model, making these predictions directly relevant to experimental synthesis.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a prevalent technique in materials characterization. While the analysis of PXRD often requires extensive human manual intervention, and most automated method only achieved at coarse-grained level. The more difficult and important task of fine-grained crystal structure prediction from PXRD remains unaddressed. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant deep generative model for end-to-end crystal structure prediction from PXRD. Unlike previous crystal structure prediction methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet's effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 in conditional crystal structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet enables the direct prediction of crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for manual intervention and external databases. This opens up new possibilities for automated crystal structure determination and the accelerated discovery of novel materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We propose a novel, physically-constrained and differentiable approach for the generation of D-dimensional qudit states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in quantum optics. We circumvent any limitations imposed by the inherently stochastic nature of the physical process and incorporate a set of stochastic dynamical equations governing its evolution under the SPDC Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through the design of structured nonlinear photonic crystals (NLPCs) and shaped pump beams; and show, theoretically and experimentally, how to generate maximally entangled states in the spatial degree of freedom. The learning of NLPC structures offers a promising new avenue for shaping and controlling arbitrary quantum states and enables all-optical coherent control of the generated states. We believe that this approach can readily be extended from bulky crystals to thin Metasurfaces and potentially applied to other quantum systems sharing a similar Hamiltonian structures, such as superfluids and superconductors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Language models are powerful tools for molecular design. Currently, the dominant paradigm is to parse molecular graphs into linear string representations that can easily be trained on. This approach has been very successful, however, it is limited to chemical structures that can be completely represented by a graph -- like organic molecules -- while materials and biomolecular structures like protein binding sites require a more complete representation that includes the relative positioning of their atoms in space. In this work, we show how language models, without any architecture modifications, trained using next-token prediction -- can generate novel and valid structures in three dimensions from various substantially different distributions of chemical structures. In particular, we demonstrate that language models trained directly on sequences derived directly from chemical file formats like XYZ files, Crystallographic Information files (CIFs), or Protein Data Bank files (PDBs) can directly generate molecules, crystals, and protein binding sites in three dimensions. Furthermore, despite being trained on chemical file sequences -- language models still achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that use graph and graph-derived string representations, as well as other domain-specific 3D generative models. In doing so, we demonstrate that it is not necessary to use simplified molecular representations to train chemical language models -- that they are powerful generative models capable of directly exploring chemical space in three dimensions for very different structures.</p>

    <p>Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect conformational diversity. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Normalizing flows (NF) are a class of powerful generative models that have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex distributions with high flexibility and expressiveness. In this work, we introduce a new type of normalizing flow that is tailored for modeling positions and orientations of multiple objects in three-dimensional space, such as molecules in a crystal. Our approach is based on two key ideas: first, we define smooth and expressive flows on the group of unit quaternions, which allows us to capture the continuous rotational motion of rigid bodies; second, we use the double cover property of unit quaternions to define a proper density on the rotation group. This ensures that our model can be trained using standard likelihood-based methods or variational inference with respect to a thermodynamic target density. We evaluate the method by training Boltzmann generators for two molecular examples, namely the multi-modal density of a tetrahedral system in an external field and the ice XI phase in the TIP4P water model. Our flows can be combined with flows operating on the internal degrees of freedom of molecules and constitute an important step towards the modeling of distributions of many interacting molecules.</p>

    <p>The Starshot Breakthrough Initiative aims to send one-gram microchip probes to Alpha Centauri within 20 years, using gram-scale lightsails propelled by laser-based radiation pressure, reaching velocities nearing a fifth of light speed. This mission requires lightsail materials that challenge the fundamentals of nanotechnology, requiring innovations in optics, material science and structural engineering. Unlike the microchip payload, which must be minimized in every dimension, such lightsails need meter-scale dimensions with nanoscale thickness and billions of nanoscale holes to enhance reflectivity and reduce mass. Our study employs neural topology optimization, revealing a novel pentagonal lattice-based photonic crystal (PhC) reflector. The optimized designs shorten acceleration times, therefore lowering launch costs significantly. Crucially, these designs also enable lightsail material fabrication with orders-of-magnitude reduction in costs. We have fabricated a 60 x 60 mm$^2$, 200nm thick, single-layer reflector perforated with over a billion nanoscale features; the highest aspect-ratio nanophotonic element to date. We achieve this with nearly 9,000 times cost reduction per m$^2$. Starshot lightsails will have several stringent requirements but will ultimately be driven by costs to build at scale. Here we highlight challenges and possible solutions in developing lightsail materials - showcasing the potential of scaling nanophotonics for cost-effective next-generation space exploration.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>From AlexNet to Inception, autoencoders to diffusion models, the development of novel and powerful deep learning models and learning algorithms has proceeded at breakneck speeds. In part, we believe that rapid iteration of model architecture and learning techniques by a large community of researchers over a common representation of the underlying entities has resulted in transferable deep learning knowledge. As a result, model scale, accuracy, fidelity, and compute performance have dramatically increased in computer vision and natural language processing. On the other hand, the lack of a common representation for chemical structure has hampered similar progress. To enable transferable deep learning, we identify the need for a robust 3-dimensional representation of materials such as molecules and crystals. The goal is to enable both materials property prediction and materials generation with 3D structures. While computationally costly, such representations can model a large set of chemical structures. We propose $\textit{ParticleGrid}$, a SIMD-optimized library for 3D structures, that is designed for deep learning applications and to seamlessly integrate with deep learning frameworks. Our highly optimized grid generation allows for generating grids on the fly on the CPU, reducing storage and GPU compute and memory requirements. We show the efficacy of 3D grids generated via $\textit{ParticleGrid}$ and accurately predict molecular energy properties using a 3D convolutional neural network. Our model is able to get 0.006 mean square error and nearly match the values calculated using computationally costly density functional theory at a fraction of the time.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We introduce Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets), an end-to-end framework that combines deep learning with reasoning for solving complex tasks, typically in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised setting. DRNets exploit problem structure and prior knowledge by tightly combining logic and constraint reasoning with stochastic-gradient-based neural network optimization. We illustrate the power of DRNets on de-mixing overlapping hand-written Sudokus (Multi-MNIST-Sudoku) and on a substantially more complex task in scientific discovery that concerns inferring crystal structures of materials from X-ray diffraction data under thermodynamic rules (Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping). At a high level, DRNets encode a structured latent space of the input data, which is constrained to adhere to prior knowledge by a reasoning module. The structured latent encoding is used by a generative decoder to generate the targeted output. Finally, an overall objective combines responses from the generative decoder (thinking fast) and the reasoning module (thinking slow), which is optimized using constraint-aware stochastic gradient descent. We show how to encode different tasks as DRNets and demonstrate DRNets' effectiveness with detailed experiments: DRNets significantly outperform the state of the art and experts' capabilities on Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping, recovering more precise and physically meaningful crystal structures. On Multi-MNIST-Sudoku, DRNets perfectly recovered the mixed Sudokus' digits, with 100% digit accuracy, outperforming the supervised state-of-the-art MNIST de-mixing models. Finally, as a proof of concept, we also show how DRNets can solve standard combinatorial problems -- 9-by-9 Sudoku puzzles and Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT), outperforming other specialized deep learning models. DRNets are general and can be adapted and expanded to tackle other tasks.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This paper presents a study on the integration of domain-specific knowledge in prompt engineering to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in scientific domains. A benchmark dataset is curated to encapsulate the intricate physical-chemical properties of small molecules, their drugability for pharmacology, alongside the functional attributes of enzymes and crystal materials, underscoring the relevance and applicability across biological and chemical domains.The proposed domain-knowledge embedded prompt engineering method outperforms traditional prompt engineering strategies on various metrics, including capability, accuracy, F1 score, and hallucination drop. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies on complex materials including the MacMillan catalyst, paclitaxel, and lithium cobalt oxide. The results suggest that domain-knowledge prompts can guide LLMs to generate more accurate and relevant responses, highlighting the potential of LLMs as powerful tools for scientific discovery and innovation when equipped with domain-specific prompts. The study also discusses limitations and future directions for domain-specific prompt engineering development.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Serial crystallography is the field of science that studies the structure and properties of crystals via diffraction patterns. In this paper, we introduce a new serial crystallography dataset comprised of real and synthetic images; the synthetic images are generated through the use of a simulator that is both scalable and accurate. The resulting dataset is called DiffraNet, and it is composed of 25,457 512x512 grayscale labeled images. We explore several computer vision approaches for classification on DiffraNet such as standard feature extraction algorithms associated with Random Forests and Support Vector Machines but also an end-to-end CNN topology dubbed DeepFreak tailored to work on this new dataset. All implementations are publicly available and have been fine-tuned using off-the-shelf AutoML optimization tools for a fair comparison. Our best model achieves 98.5% accuracy on synthetic images and 94.51% accuracy on real images. We believe that the DiffraNet dataset and its classification methods will have in the long term a positive impact in accelerating discoveries in many disciplines, including chemistry, geology, biology, materials science, metallurgy, and physics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We use time-resolved hard x-ray diffraction to investigate the structural dynamics of the multiferroic insulator TbMnO$_3$ in the low temperature antiferromagnetic and ferroelectrically ordered phase. The lattice response following photoexcitation at 1.55 eV is detected by measuring the (0 2 4) and (1 3 -5) Bragg reflections. A 0.02% tensile strain, normal to the surface, is seen to arise within 20 - 30 ps. The magnitude of this transient strain is over an order of magnitude lower than that predicted from laser-induced heating, which we attribute to a bottleneck in the energy transfer between the electronic and lattice subsystems. The timescale for the transient expansion is consistent with that of previously reported demagnetization dynamics. We discuss a possible relationship between structural and demagnetization dynamics in TbMnO$_3$, in which photoinduced atomic motion modulates the exchange interaction, leading to a destruction of the magnetic order in the system.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The use of simple, fast and economic experimental tools to characterize low-dimensional materials is an important step in the process of democratizing the use of such materials in laboratories around the world. Raman spectroscopy has arisen as a way of indirectly determining the thickness of nanolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), avoiding the use of more expensive tools such as atomic force microscopy, and it is therefore a widely used technique in the study of semiconducting TMDs. However, the study of many metallic TMDs in the limit of few atomic layers is still behind when compared to their semiconducting counterparts, partly due to the lack of similar alternative characterization studies. In this work we present the characterization of the Raman spectrum, specifically of the E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes, of mechanically exfoliated crystals of Ta$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$S$_2$, a metallic TMD which exhibits charge density wave formation and superconductivity. The clear identification of contributions to the Raman spectrum coming from the SiO$_2$/Si substrate, which overlap with the peaks coming from the sample, and which dominate in intensity in the few-layer-samples limit, allowed the isolation of the individual E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes of the samples and, for the first time, the observation of a clear evolution of the Raman shifts of both modes as a function of sample thickness. The evolution of such peaks qualitatively resembles the evolution seen in other TMDs, and provide a way of indirectly determining sample thickness in the limit of few atomic layers at a low cost. In addition, we observe a softening (red-shift) of both E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes with Mo-doping in the nanolayers, possibly related to the increased out-of-plane lattice parameter with respect to the pure compound.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The charge state of dielectric surfaces in aqueous environments is of fundamental and technological importance. Here, we study the influence of dissolved molecular CO$_2$ on the charging of three, chemically different surfaces (SiO$_2$, Polystyrene, Perfluorooctadecyltrichlorosilane). We determine their charge state from electrokinetic experiments. We compare an ideal, CO$_2$-free reference system to a system equilibrated against ambient CO$_2$ conditions. In the reference system, the salt-dependence is weakened for SiO$_2$ and inverted for the organic surfaces. We show that screening and pH-driven charge regulation alone cannot explain the observed effects. As additional cause, we tentatively suggest dielectric regulation of surface charges due to a diffusively adsorbed thin layer of molecular CO$_2$. The formation of such a dynamic layer even at the hydrophilic and partially ionized silica surfaces is supported by a minimal theoretical model and results from molecular simulations.</p>

    <p>Submicron core/shell Ti/TiOx photocatalyst is successfully synthesized via single-mode magnetic microwave (SMMW) assisted direct oxidation of planetary ball-milled TiH2. The thickness of TiOx shell including highly concentrated defects such as Ti3+ and/or oxygen vacancies is controllable in the range from 6 to over 18 nm by varying the treatment time in the SMMW assisted reaction. In addition to its quite narrow optical bandgap (1.34-2.69 eV) and efficient visible-light absorption capacity, the submicron Ti/TiOx particle exhibits superior photocatalytic performance towards H2 production from water under both UV and visible-light irradiation to compare with a commercial TiO2 photocatalyst (P-25). Such excellent performance can be achieved by the synergetic effect of enhancement in visible light absorption capacity and photo-excited carrier separation because of the highly concentrated surface defects and the specific Ti/TiOx core/shell structure, respectively.</p>

    <p>The magnetic ground states of $R_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and $A_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with $R=$ Pr, Gd, Ho, and Er, as well as $A=$ Ca, Cd are predicted devising a combination of the cluster-multipole (CMP) theory and spin-density-functional theory (SDFT). The strong electronic correlation effects are estimated by the constrained-random-phase approximation (cRPA) and taken into account within the dynamical-mean-field theory (DMFT). The target compounds feature $d$-orbital magnetism on Ru$^{4+}$ and Ru$^{5+}$ ions for $R$ and $A$, respectively, as well as $f$-orbital magnetism on the $R$ site, which leads to an intriguing interplay of magnetic interactions in a strongly correlated system. We find CMP+SDFT is capable of describing the magnetic ground states in these compounds. The cRPA captures a difference in the screening strength between $R_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and $A_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ compounds, which leads to a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the electronic properties within DMFT.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The origin of water on the Earth is a long-standing mystery, requiring a comprehensive search for hydrous compounds, stable at conditions of the deep Earth and made of Earth-abundant elements. Previous studies usually focused on the current range of pressure-temperature conditions in the Earth's mantle and ignored a possible difference in the past, such as the stage of the core-mantle separation. Here, using ab initio evolutionary structure prediction, we find that only two magnesium hydrosilicate phases are stable at megabar pressures, $Œ±$-Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ and $Œ≤$-Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$, stable at 262-338 GPa and >338 GPa,respectively (all these pressures now lie within the Earth's iron core). Both are superionic conductors with quasi-one-dimensional proton diffusion at relevant conditions. In the first 30 million years of Earth's history, before the Earth's core was formed, these must have existed in the Earth, hosting much of Earth's water. As dense iron alloys segregated to form the Earth's core, Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ phases decomposed and released water. Thus, now-extinct Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ phases have likely contributed in a major way to the evolution of our planet.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work we employ an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network to predict the failure locations of porous metal tension specimens based only on their initial porosities. The process we model is complex, with a progression from initial void nucleation, to saturation, and ultimately failure. The objective of predicting failure locations presents an extreme case of class imbalance since most of the material in the specimens do not fail. In response to this challenge, we develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of data- and loss-based regularization methods. Since there is considerable sensitivity of the failure location to the particular configuration of voids, we also use variational inference to provide uncertainties for the neural network predictions. We connect the deterministic and Bayesian convolutional neural networks at a theoretical level to explain how variational inference regularizes the training and predictions. We demonstrate that the resulting predicted variances are effective in ranking the locations that are most likely to fail in any given specimen.</p>

    <p>We compute the correlated electronic structure of stacked $1T$-TaS$_2$ bilayers using the $GW$ + EDMFT method. Depending on the surface termination, the semi-infinite uncorrelated system is either band-insulating or exhibits a metallic surface state. For realistic values of the onsite and intersite interactions, a Mott gap opens in the surface state, but this gap is smaller than the gap originating from the bilayer structure. Our results are consistent with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements for different terminating layers, and with our own photoemission measurements, which indicate the coexistence of spatial regions with different gaps in the electronic spectrum.</p>

    <p>Chemical substitution is a promising route for the exploration of a rich variety of doping- and/or disorder-dependent collective phenomena in low-dimensional quantum materials. Here we show that transition metal dichalcogenide alloys are ideal platforms to this purpose. In particular, we demonstrate the emergence of superconductivity in the otherwise metallic single-layer TaSe$_{2}$ by minute electron doping provided by substitutional W atoms. We investigate the temperature- and magnetic field-dependence of the superconducting state of Ta$_{1-Œ¥}$W$_Œ¥$Se$_2$ with electron doping ($Œ¥$) using variable temperature (0.34 K - 4.2 K) scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). We unveil the emergence of a superconducting dome spanning 0.003 < $Œ¥$ < 0.03 with a maximized critical temperature of 0.9 K, a significant increase from that of bulk TaSe$_{2}$ (T$_C$ = 0.14 K). Superconductivity emerges from an increase of the density of states (DOS) as the Fermi surface approaches a van Hove singularity due to doping. Once the singularity is reached, however, the DOS decreases with $Œ¥$, which gradually weakens the superconducting state, thus shaping the superconducting dome. Lastly, our doping-dependent measurements allow us to unambiguously track the development of a Coulomb glass phase triggered by disorder due to W dopants.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Graphene is attracting vast interest due to its superior electronic and mechanical properties. However, structure and electronic properties of its edge are often neglected, although they are important for nanoscale devices because the edge ratio becomes larger by decreasing the device size. In this study, we suggest a way to fabricate a graphene with atomically aligned zigzag edges by applying hydrogen-plasma etching (HPE) technique. By patterning a graphene prior to HPE, it is succeeded to shape a graphene in desired structure. Both atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirm that the graphene shaped by this technique preserves its honeycomb structure even on the edge, which is aligned with zigzag structure. Although the mechanism of the anisotropic etching by hydrogen-plasma have not been clarified yet, the sample position dependence of the etching rate suggests that the hydrogen-radicals are responsible for the anisotropic etching.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Non-magnetic impurities in iron-based superconductors can provide an important tool to understand the pair symmetry and they can influence significantly the transport and the superconducting behaviour. Here, we present a study of the role of strong impurity potential in the Fe plane, induced by Cu substitution, on the electronic and superconducting properties of single crystals of FeSe. The addition of Cu quickly suppresses both the nematic and superconducting states, and increases the residual resistivity due to enhanced impurity scattering. Using magnetotransport data up to 35 T for a small amount of Cu impurity, we detect a significant reduction in the mobility of the charge carriers by a factor of ~3. While the electronic conduction is strongly disrupted by Cu substitution, we identify additional signatures of anisotropic scattering which manifest in linear resistivity at low temperatures and $H^{1.6}$ dependence of magnetoresistance. The suppression of superconductivity by Cu substitution is consistent with a sign-changing $s_{\pm}$ order parameter. Additionally, in the presence of compressive strain, the superconductivity is enhanced, similar to FeSe.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are theoretically able to concentrate both direct and diffuse solar radiation with extremely high efficiencies. Photon-multiplier luminescent solar concentrators (PM-LSCs) contain chromophores which exceed 100\% photoluminescence quantum efficiency. PM-LSCs have recently been experimentally demonstrated and hold promise to outcompete traditional LSCs. However, we find that the thermodynamic limits of PM-LSCs are different and are sometimes more extreme relative to traditional LSCs. As might be expected, to achieve very high concentration factors a PM-LSC design must also include a free energy change, analogous to the Stokes shift in traditional LSCs. Notably, unlike LSCs, the maximum concentration ratio of a PM-LSC is dependent on brightness of the incident photon field. For some brightnesses, but equivalent energy loss, the PM-LSC has a greater maximum concentration factor than that of the traditional LSC. We find that the thermodynamic requirements to achieve highly concentrating PM-LSCs differ from traditional LSCs. The new model gives insight into the limits of concentration of PM-LSCs and may be used to extract design rules for further PM-LSC design.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>How local stresses propagate through polymeric fluids, and, more generally, how macromolecular dynamics give rise to viscoelasticity are open questions vital to wide-ranging scientific and industrial fields. Here, to unambiguously connect polymer dynamics to force response, and map stress propagation in macromolecular materials, we present a powerful approach-Optical Tweezers integrating Differential Dynamic Microscopy (OpTiDMM)-that simultaneously imposes local strains, measures resistive forces, and analyzes the motion of the surrounding polymers. Our measurements with blends of ring and linear polymers (DNA) and their composites with stiff polymers (microtubules) uncover a surprising resonant response, in which affine alignment, superdiffusivity, and elastic memory are maximized when the strain rate is comparable to the entanglement rate. Microtubules suppress this resonance, while substantially increasing elastic force and memory, due to varying degrees to which the polymers buildup, stretch and flow along the strain path, and configurationally dissipate stress. More broadly, the rich multi-scale coupling of mechanics and dynamics afforded by OpTiDDM, empowers its interdisciplinary use to elucidate non-trivial phenomena that sculpt stress propagation dynamics-critical to commercial applications and cell mechanics alike.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Electron-hole bound pairs, or excitons, are common excitations in semiconductors. They can spontaneously form and ``condense'' into a new insulating ground state -- the so-called excitonic insulator -- when the energy of electron-hole Coulomb attraction exceeds the band gap. In the presence of electron-phonon coupling, a periodic lattice distortion often concomitantly occurs with this exciton condensation. However, similar structural transition can also be induced by electron-phonon coupling itself, therefore hindering the clean identification of bulk excitonic insulators based on reductionistic reasoning (e.g. which instability is the ``driving force'' of the phase transition). Using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques, we identify key electron-phonon coupling effects in a leading excitonic insulator candidate Ta2NiSe5. These include an extensive unidirectional lattice fluctuation and an electronic pseudogap in the normal state, as well as a negative electronic compressibility in the charge-doped broken-symmetry state. In combination with first principles and model calculations, we determine a minimal lattice model and the corresponding interaction parameters that capture the experimental observations. More importantly, we show how the Coulomb and electron-phonon coupling effects can be separated on the level of lattice model, and demonstrate a general framework beyond the reductionist approach in the investigation of correlated systems with intertwined orders.</p>

    <p>The uniform electron gas (UEG), a hypothetical system with finite homogenous electron density composed by an infinite number of electrons in a box of infinite volume, is the practical pillar of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the most acclaimed approximation of DFT, the local-density approximation (LDA). In the last thirty years, the knowledge of analytical parametrizations of the infinite UEG (IUEG) exchange-correlation energy has allowed researchers to perform a countless number of approximate electronic structure calculations for atoms, molecules, and solids. Recently, it has been shown that the traditional concept of the IUEG is not the unique example of UEGs, and systems, in their lowest-energy state, consisting of electrons that are confined to the surface of a sphere provide a new family of UEGs with more customizable properties. Here, we show that, some of the excited states associated with these systems can be classified as transient UEGs (TUEGs) as their electron density is only homogenous for very specific values of the radius of the sphere even though the electronic wave function is not rotationally invariant. Concrete examples are provided in the case of two-electron systems.</p>

    <p>The transfer and control of angular momentum is a key aspect for spintronic applications. Only recently, it was shown that it is possible to transfer angular momentum from the spin system to the lattice on ultrashort time scales. In an attempt to contribute to the understanding of angular momentum transfer between spin and lattice degrees of freedom we present a scheme to calculate fully-relativistic spin-lattice coupling parameters from first-principles. By treating changes in the spin configuration and atomic positions at the same level, closed expressions for the atomic spin-lattice coupling parameters can be derived in a coherent manner up to any order. Analyzing the properties of these parameters, in particular their dependence on spin-orbit coupling, we find that even in bcc Fe the leading term for the angular momentum exchange between the spin system and the lattice is a Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya-type interaction, which is due to the symmetry breaking distortion of the lattice.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Optimization strategies driven by machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or materials. Although many of these constraints are known a priori, they can be interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate their practical utility in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the synthesis of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions, and the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic accessibility constraints. The tools developed constitute a simple, yet versatile strategy to enable model-based optimization with known experimental constraints, contributing to its applicability as a core component of autonomous platforms for scientific discovery.</p>

    <p>We report the synthesis of powder and single-crystal samples of the cerium pyrohafnate and their characterization using neutron diffraction, thermogravimetry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We evaluate the amount of non-magnetic Ce$^{4+}$ defects and use this result to interpret the spectrum of crystal-electric field transitions observed using inelastic neutron scattering. The analysis of these single-ion transitions indicates the dipole-octupole nature of the ground state doublet and a significant degree of spin-lattice coupling. The single-ion properties calculated from the crystal-electric field parameters obtained spectroscopically are in good agreement with bulk magnetic susceptibility data down to about 1 K. Below this temperature, the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility indicates a correlated regime without showing any sign of magnetic long-range order or freezing down to 0.08 K. We conclude that Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_{7}$ is another candidate to investigate exotic correlated states of quantum matter such as the octupolar quantum spin ice recently argued to exist in the isostructural compounds Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.</p>

    <p>The subthreshold leakage current in transistors has become a critical limiting factor for realizing ultra-low-power transistors. The leakage current is predominantly dictated by the long thermal tail of the charge carriers. We propose a solution to this problem by using narrow bandwidth semiconductors for limiting the thermionic leakage current by filtering out the high energy carriers. We specifically demonstrate this solution in transistors with laterally confined monolayer MoSi2N4 with different passivation serving as channel material. Remarkably, we find that the proposed narrow bandwidth devices can achieve a large ON/OFF current ratio with an ultra-low-power supply voltage of 0.1 V, even for devices with a 5 nm gate length. We also show that several other materials share the unique electronic properties of narrow bandwidth conduction and valance bands in the same series.</p>

Both of the topology and magnetism in these materials are from $3d$-orbitals of Ti. We construct the tight-binding model with symmetry analysis to reveal the origin of topology. Remarkably, quite different from the conventional $s$-$d$ band inversion, here the topological band inversion within $3d$ orbitals is due to the crystal field and electron hopping, while spin-orbit coupling only trivially gaps out the Dirac cone at Fermi level. The general physics from the $3d$ orbitals here applies to a large class of transition metal compounds with the space group $P4/nmm$ or $P$-$42m$ and their subgroups.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In a magnetic metal, the Hall resistance is generally taken to be the sum of the ordinary Hall resistance and the anomalous Hall resistance. Here it is shown that this empirical relation is no longer valid when either the ordinary Hall angle or the anomalous Hall angle is not small. Using the proper conductivity relation, we reveal an unexpected magnetoresistance (MR) induced by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). A $B$-linear MR arises and the sign of the slope depends on the sign of the anomalous Hall angle, giving rise to a characteristic bowtie shape. The Hall resistance in a single-band system can exhibit a nonlinearity which is usually considered as a characteristic of a two-band system. A $B$-symmetric component appears in the Hall. These effects reflect the fundamental difference between the ordinary Hall effect and the AHE. Furthermore, we experimentally reproduce the unusual MR and Hall reported before in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ and show that these observations can be well explained by the proposed mechanism. MR often observed in quantum anomalous Hall insulators provides further confirmation of the picture. The effect may also account for the large MR observed in non-magnetic three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals.</p>

    <p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) are promising candidates for ultra-thin active nanophotonic elements due to the strong tunable excitonic resonances that dominate their optical response. Here we demonstrate dynamic beam steering by an active van der Waals metasurface that leverages large complex refractive index tunability near excitonic resonances in monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2). Through varying the radiative and nonradiative rates of the excitons, we can dynamically control both the reflection amplitude and phase profiles, resulting in an excitonic phased array metasurface. Our experiments show reflected light steering to angles between -30¬∞ to 30¬∞ at three different resonant wavelengths corresponding to the A exciton, B exciton, and trion. This active van der Waals metasurface relies solely on the excitonic resonances of the monolayer MoSe2 material rather than geometric resonances of patterned nanostructures, suggesting the potential to harness the tunability of excitonic resonances for wavefront shaping in emerging photonic applications.</p>

We argue that condensation of multipolar magnons in large-spin materials with a strong magnetic anisotropy can produce new exotic states.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Heat-capacity measurements are a useful tool for understanding the complex phase behaviour of systems containing one-dimensional motifs. Here we study the signature within such measurements of the incorporation of defects into quasi-one-dimensional (q-1D) systems. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that, on dilution by non-interacting sites, q-1D Ising models display a low-temperature signature not present in conventional three-dimensional models. Frustrated embeddings of 1D chains show similar features to unfrustrated embeddings, with the additional emergence of a finite ground-state entropy in the former, which arises from chain segmentation. We introduce a mean-field formulation which captures the low-temperature behaviour of the model. This theoretical framework is applied to the interpretation of experimental heat-capacity measurements of the Tb$_{1-œÅ}$Y$_œÅ$(HCOO)$_3$ family of magnetocalorics. We find good correspondence between simulation and experiment, establishing this system as a canonical example of dilute q-1D magnets.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We theoretically study the optical absorption of an angulon in the metal halide perovskites (MHP) based on the improved Devreese-Huybrechts-Lemmens model, where the formation of quasiparticle angulon states originates from the organic cation rotating in the inorganic octahedral cage of MHP. We find that the resonance optical absorption peaks are appeared when the energy of incident photon matches the quantum levels of angulon. Moreover, the intensity of absorption depends on the quantum states of phonon angular momentum. These theoretical results provide significant insight to study the redistribution of angular momenta for the rotational molecules immersed into the many-body environment.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We report spin-polarized transient absorption for colloidal CdSe nanoplatelets as functions of thickness (2 to 6 monolayer thickness) and core/shell motif. Using electro-optical modulation of co- and cross-polarization pump-probe combinations, we sensitively observe spin-polarized transitions. Core-only nanoplatelets exhibit few-picosecond spin lifetimes that weakly increase with layer thickness. Spectral content of differenced spin-polarized signals indicate biexciton binding energies that decrease with increasing thickness and smaller values than previously reported. Shell growth of CdS with controlled thicknesses, which partially delocalize the electron from the hole, significantly increases the spin lifetime to ~49 picoseconds at room temperature. Implementation of ZnS shells, which do not alter delocalization but do alter surface termination, increased spin lifetimes up to ~100 ps, bolstering the interpretation that surface termination heavily influences spin coherence, likely due to passivation of dangling bonds. Spin precession in magnetic fields both confirms long coherence lifetime at room temperature and yields excitonic g-factor.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Research on conjugated polymers for thermoelectric applications has made tremendous progress in recent years, which is accompanied by surging interest in molecular doping as a means to achieve the high electrical conductivities that are required. A detailed understanding of the complex relationship between the doping process, the structural as well as energetic properties of the polymer films, and the resulting thermoelectric behavior is slowly emerging. This review summarizes recent developments and strategies that permit enhancing the electrical conductivity of p- and n-type conjugated polymers via molecular doping. The impact of the chemical design of both the polymer and the dopant, the processing conditions, and the resulting nanostructure on the doping efficiency and stability of the doped state are discussed. Attention is paid to the interdependence of the electrical and thermal transport characteristics of semiconductor host-dopant systems and the Seebeck coefficient. Strategies that permit to improve the thermoelectric performance, such as an uniaxial alignment of the polymer backbone in both bulk and thin film geometries, manipulation of the dielectric constant of the polymer, and the variation of the dopant size, are explored. A combination of theory and experiment is predicted to yield new chemical design principles and processing schemes that will ultimately give rise to the next generation of organic thermoelectric materials.</p>

    <p>It is well known that phonons can overscreen the bare Coulomb electron-electron repulsion, turning it into the effective attraction that binds the Cooper pairs responsible for BCS superconductivity. Here, we use a simple lattice model to prove that the counterpart of this is also possible, whereby phonons overscreen the bare electron-hole attraction and may turn it repulsive at short distances, driving exciton dissociation in certain regions of the parameter space. We argue that this phonon-mediated short-range screening plays an important role in the physics of organic solar cell materials (and other materials with strong electron-phonon coupling) and could point the way to new strategies for optimizing their efficiencies.</p>

    <p>The areal footprint of memristors is a key consideration in material-based neuromorophic computing and large-scale architecture integration. Electronic transport in the most widely investigated memristive devices is mediated by filaments, posing a challenge to their scalability in architecture implementation. Here we present a compelling alternative memristive device and demonstrate that areal downscaling leads to enhancement in memristive memory window, while maintaining analogue behavior, contrary to expectations. Our device designs directly integrated on semiconducting Nb-SrTiO$_3$ allows leveraging electric field effects at edges, increasing the dynamic range in smaller devices. Our findings are substantiated by studying the microscopic nature of switching using scanning transmission electron microscopy, in different resistive states, revealing an interfacial layer whose physical extent is influenced by applied electric fields. The ability of Nb-SrTiO$_3$ memristors to satisfy hardware and software requirements with downscaling, while significantly enhancing memristive functionalities, makes them strong contenders for non-von Neumann computing, beyond CMOS.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of a chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals, the non-conservation of chiral charge and energy across two opposite chirality Weyl nodes, has sparked immense interest in understanding its impact on various physical phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the existence of electrical, thermal, and gravitational quantum chiral anomalies in 3D spin-orbit coupled systems. Notably, these anomalies involve chiral charge transfer across two Fermi surfaces linked to a single Weyl-like point, rather than across opposite chirality Weyl nodes as in Weyl semimetals. Our findings reveal that the Berry curvature flux piercing the Fermi surface plays a critical role in distinguishing the `chirality' of the carriers and the corresponding chiral charge and energy transfer. Importantly, we demonstrate that these quantum chiral anomalies lead to interesting thermal spin transport such as the spin Nernst effect. Our results suggest that 3D spin-orbit coupled metals offer a promising platform for investigating the interplay between quantum chiral anomalies and charge and spin transport in non-relativistic systems.</p>

    <p>Scalable quantum algorithms for the simulation of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium are important for predicting properties of quantum matter at finite temperatures. Here we describe and benchmark a quantum computing version of the minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) algorithm for which we adopt an adaptive variational approach to perform the required quantum imaginary time evolution. The algorithm, which we name AVQMETTS, dynamically generates compact and problem-specific quantum circuits, which are suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We benchmark AVQMETTS on statevector simulators and perform thermal energy calculations of integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions and demonstrate an approximately linear system-size scaling of the circuit complexity. We further map out the finite-temperature phase transition line of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Finally, we study the impact of noise on AVQMETTS calculations using a phenomenological noise model.</p>

    <p>Interfaces of dye molecules and two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) combine strong molecular dipole excitations with high carrier mobilities in semiconductors. F√∂rster type energy transfer is one key mechanism for the coupling between both constituents. We report microscopic calculations of a spectrally resolved F√∂rster induced transition rate from dye molecules to a TMDC layer. Our approach is based on microscopic Bloch equations which are solved self-consistently together with Maxwells equations. This approach allows to incorporate the dielectric environment of a TMDC semiconductor, sandwiched between donor molecules and a substrate. Our analysis reveals transfer rates in the meV range for typical dye molecules in closely stacked structures, with a non-trivial dependence of the F√∂rster rate on the molecular transition energy resulting from unique signatures of dark, momentum forbidden TMDC excitons.</p>

    <p>Two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) are a highly desired quantum phase but few materials have demonstrated clear signatures of a 2D TI state. It has been predicted that 2D TIs can be created from thin films of three-dimensional TIs by reducing the film thickness until the surface states hybridize. Here, we employ this technique to report the first observation of a 2D TI state in epitaxial thin films of cadmium arsenide, a prototype Dirac semimetal in bulk form and a 3D TI in thin films. Using magnetotransport measurements with electrostatic gating, we observe a Landau level spectrum and quantum Hall effect that are in excellent agreement with those of an ideal 2D TI. Specifically, we observe a crossing of the zeroth Landau levels at a critical magnetic field. We show that the film thickness can be used to tune the critical magnetic field. Moreover, a larger change in film thickness causes a transition from a 2D TI to a 2D trivial insulator, just as predicted by theory. The high degree of tunability available in epitaxial cadmium arsenide heterostructures can thus be used to fine-tune the 2D TI, which is essential for future topological devices.</p>

    <p>Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs-based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure, resulting in a record-high Tc among all synthesized SnAs-based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out-of-plane pz orbital to the in-plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p-orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconductors.</p>

    <p>The Berry curvature (BC) - a quantity encoding the geometric properties of the electronic wavefunctions in a solid - is at the heart of different Hall-like transport phenomena, including the anomalous Hall and the non-linear Hall and Nernst effects. In non-magnetic quantum materials with acentric crystalline arrangements, local concentrations of BC are generally linked to single-particle wavefunctions that are a quantum superposition of electron and hole excitations. BC-mediated effects are consequently observed in two-dimensional systems with pairs of massive Dirac cones and three-dimensional bulk crystals with quartets of Weyl cones. Here, we demonstrate that in materials equipped with orbital degrees of freedom local BC concentrations can arise even in the complete absence of hole excitations. In these solids, the crystals fields appearing in very low-symmetric structures trigger BCs characterized by hot-spots and singular pinch points. These characteristics naturally yield giant BC dipoles and large non-linear transport responses in time-reversal symmetric conditions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The diffusion of small molecular penetrants through polymeric materials represents an important fundamental problem, relevant to the design of materials for applications such as coatings and membranes. Polymer networks hold promise in these applications, because dramatic differences in molecular diffusion can result from subtle changes in the network structure. In this paper, we use molecular simulation to understand the role that crosslinked network polymers have in governing the molecular motion of penetrants. By considering the local, activated alpha relaxation time of the penetrant and its long-time diffusive dynamics, we can determine the relative importance of activated glassy dynamics on penetrants at the segmental scale versus entropic mesh confinement on penetrant diffusion. We vary several parameters, such as the crosslinking density, temperature, and penetrant size, to show that crosslinks primarily affect molecular diffusion through modification of the matrix glass transition, with local penetrant hopping at least partially coupled to the segmental relaxation of the polymer network. This coupling is very sensitive to the local activated segmental dynamics of the surrounding matrix, and we also show that penetrant transport is affected by dynamic heterogeneity at low temperatures. To contrast, only at high temperatures and for large penetrants or when the dynamic heterogeneity effect is weak does the effect of mesh confinement become significant, even though penetrant diffusion more broadly empirically follows similar trends as established models of mesh confinement-based transport.</p>

    <p>The organic system, $Œ∫$-[(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$(BEDT-STF)$_x$]$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, showing the Mott transition between a nonmagnetic Mott insulating (NMI) state and a Fermi liquid (FL), is systematically studied by calorimetric measurements. An increase of the electronic heat capacity at the transition from the NMI state to the FL state which keeps the triangular dimer lattice demonstrates that the charge sector lost in the Mott insulating state is recovered in the FL state. We observed that the remaining low-energy spin excitations in the Mott insulating state show unique temperature dependence, and that the NMI state has a larger lattice entropy originating from the frustrated lattice, which leads to the Pomeranchuk-like effect on the electron localization. Near the Mott boundary, an unexpected enhancement and magnetic-field dependence of heat capacity are observed. This anomalous heat capacity is different from the behavior in the typical first-order Mott transition and shows similarities with quantum critical behavior. To reconcile our results with previously reported scenarios about a spin gap and the first-order Mott transition, further studies are desired.</p>

    <p>Wilson fermion (WF) is a fundamental particle in the theory of quantum chromodynamics, originally proposed by Kenneth Wilson to solve the fermion doubling problem, i.e., more fermions than expected when one puts fermionic fields on a lattice. In this Letter, we report a direct observation of the WF in circuit systems. It is found that WFs manifest as topological spin textures analogous to the half skyrmion, half-skyrmion pair, and N√©el skyrmion structures, depending on their mass. Transformations of different WF states are realized by merely tuning the electric elements. Theoretical calculations have shown that the WF with a half-skyrmion profile represents a novel quantum anomalous semimetal phase supporting a chiral edge current [B. Fu et al. npj Quantum Mater. 7, 94 (2022)], but the experimental evidence is still lacking. We experimentally observe the propagation of chiral edge current along the domain-wall separating two circuits with contrast fractional Chern numbers. Our work presents the first experimental evidence for WFs in topolectrical circuits. The nontrivial analogy between the WF state and the skyrmionic structure builds an intimate connection between the two burgeoning fields.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We design and synthesize unentangled associative polymers carrying unprecedented high fractions of stickers, up to eight per Kuhn segment, that can form strong pairwise hydrogen bonding of $\sim20k_BT$ without microphase separation. The reversible bonds significantly slow down the polymer dynamics but nearly do not change the shape of linear viscoelastic spectra. Moreover, the structural relaxation time of associative polymers increases exponentially with the fraction of stickers and exhibits a universal yet non-Arrhenius dependence on the distance from polymer glass transition temperature. These results cannot be understood within the framework of the classic sticky-Rouse model but are rationalized by a renormalized Rouse model, which highlights an unexpected influence of reversible bonds on the structural relaxation rather than the shape of viscoelastic spectra for associative polymers with high concentrations of stickers.</p>

    <p>The recent emergence of multi-species multi-phase materials provides intriguing opportunities to maximize electrochemical performance in various electrochemical devices. This work summarizes the current understanding of the coupled transport reactions in multi-phase multi-species ionic conductors. We also provide experimental results of the fabrication of multi-phases Na-beta"-alumina+20mol% Scandia Doped Ceria(20SDC) as simultaneous sodium and oxygen ion conductor by a cost-effective vapor phase process demonstrating higher conductivity achieved in a much shorter time than other published results. In this study, two-phase contiguous composites of Al2O3+20SDC are fabricated by conventional ceramic processing and sintering in the air at 1400C 1500C, and 1600C, for 3 hours. The samples are heat-treated while exposed to a sodium oxide vapor source at different time lengths. The conversion mechanism involves coupled transport of sodium ions through newly formed Na-beta"-alumina and oxygen ions through 20SDC. The experimental data are analyzed using diffraction and spectroscopy methods. The samples with finer grains show faster kinetics compared to coarse microstructures due to the presence of more extended triple-phase boundaries (TPB). As a result, the total conductivity of the multi-phase sample compared to that of pure 20SDC is improved by three times, while fabrication time is decreased by 60% compared to Na-beta"-alumina+YSZ.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The coupling of electrons and phonons is governed wisely by the symmetry properties of the crystal structures. In particular, for two-dimensional (2D) systems, it has been suggested that the electrons do not couple to phonons with pure out-of-plane distortion, as long as there is a $œÉ_h$ symmetry. We show that such a statement is correct when constituents of the unit-cell layer are only located in the $œÉ_h$ symmetric plane; a prominent example of such a system is graphene. For those 2D crystals in which atoms are vertically located away from the horizontal symmetric plane (e.g., 1H transition metal dichalcogenides), acoustic flexural modes do not couple to the electrons up to linear order, while optical flexural phonons, which preserve $œÉ_h$ symmetry, do couple with the electrons. Our conclusions are supported by an analytic argument together with numerical calculations using density functional perturbation theory.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Superinsulators offer a unique laboratory realizing strong interaction phenomena like confinement and asymptotic freedom in quantum materials. Recent experiments evidenced that superinsulators are the mirror-twins of superconductors with reversed electric and magnetic field effects. Cooper pairs and Cooper holes in the superinsulator are confined into neutral electric pions by electric strings, with the Cooper pairs playing the role of quarks. Here we report the non-equilibrium relaxation of the electric pions in superinsulating films. We find that the time delay $t_{\mathrm{sh}}$ of the current passage in the superinsulator is related to the applied voltage $V$ via the power law, $t_{\mathrm{sh}}\propto (V-V_{\mathrm p})^{-Œº}$, where $V_{\mathrm p}$ is the effective threshold voltage. Two distinct critical exponents, $Œº=1/2$ and $Œº=3/4$, correspond to jumps from the electric Meissner state to the mixed state and to the superinsulating resistive state with broken charge confinement, respectively. The $Œº=1/2$ value establishes a direct experimental evidence for the electric strings' linear potential confining the charges of opposite signs in the electric Meissner state and effectively rules out disorder-induced localization as a mechanism for superinsulation. We further report the memory effects and their corresponding dynamic critical exponents arising upon the sudden reversal of the applied voltage. Our observations open routes for exploring fundamental strong interaction charge confinement via desktop experiments.</p>

    <p>We present a comprehensive experimental and ab-initio study of the $S=1/2$ Mo$^{5+}$ system, KMoOP$_2$O$_7$, and show that it realizes the $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain antiferromagnet model. Powder neutron diffraction reveals that KMoOP$_2$O$_7$ forms a magnetic network comprised of pairs of Mo$^{5+}$ chains within its monoclinic $P2_1/n$ structure. Antiferromagnetic interactions within the Mo$^{5+}$ chains are identified through magnetometry measurements and confirmed by analysis of the magnetic specific heat. The latter reveals a broad feature centred on $T_\textrm{N} = 0.54$ K, which we ascribe to the onset of long-range antiferromagnetic order. No magnetic Bragg scattering is observed in powder neutron diffraction data collected at 0.05 K, however, which is consistent with a strongly suppressed ordered moment with an upper limit $Œº_\textrm{ord} < 0.15 Œº_\textrm{B}$. The one-dimensional character of the magnetic correlations in KMoOP$_2$O$_7$ is verified through analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data, resulting in a model with $J_\textrm{1} \approx 34$ K and $J_\textrm{2} \approx -2$ K for the intrachain and interchain exchange interactions, respectively. The origin of these experimental findings are addressed through density-functional theory calculations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Stacking two-dimensional layered materials such as graphene and transitional metal dichalcogenides with nonzero interlayer twist angles has recently become attractive because of the emergence of novel physical properties. Stacking of one-dimensional nanomaterials offers the lateral stacking offset as an additional parameter for modulating the resulting material properties. Here, we report that the edge states of twisted bilayer zigzag graphene nanoribbons (TBZGNRs) can be tuned with both the twist angle and the stacking offset. Strong edge state variations in the stacking region are first revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We construct and characterize twisted bilayer zigzag graphene nanoribbon (TBZGNR) systems on a Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy. A detailed analysis of three prototypical orthogonal TBZGNR junctions exhibiting different stacking offsets by means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals emergent near-zero-energy states. From a comparison with DFT calculations, we conclude that the emergent edge states originate from the formation of flat bands whose energy and spin degeneracy are highly tunable with the stacking offset. Our work highlights fundamental differences between 2D and 1D twistronics and spurs further investigation of twisted one-dimensional systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In solids, strong repulsion between electrons can inhibit their movement and result in a "Mott" metal-to-insulator transition (MIT), a fundamental phenomenon whose understanding has remained a challenge for over 50 years. A key issue is how the wave-like itinerant electrons change into a localized-like state due to increased interactions. However, observing the MIT in terms of the energy- and momentum-resolved electronic structure of the system, the only direct way to probe both itinerant and localized states, has been elusive. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), that in V$_2$O$_3$ the temperature-induced MIT is characterized by the progressive disappearance of its itinerant conduction band, without any change in its energy-momentum dispersion, and the simultaneous shift to larger binding energies of a quasi-localized state initially located near the Fermi level.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Overlaying two graphene layers with a small twist angle can create a moire superlattice to realize exotic phenomena that are entirely absent in graphene monolayer. A representative example is the predicted formation of localized pseudo-Landau levels (PLLs) with Kagome lattice in tiny-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with theta < 0.3 deg when the graphene layers are subjected to different electrostatic potentials. However, this was shown only for the model of rigidly rotated TBG which is not realized in reality due to an interfacial structural reconstruction. It is believed that the interfacial structural reconstruction strongly inhibits the formation of the PLLs. Here, we systematically study electronic properties of the TBG with 0.075 deg < theta < 1.2 deg and demonstrate, unexpectedly, that the PLLs are quite robust for all the studied TBG. The structural reconstruction suppresses the formation of the emergent Kagome lattice in the tiny-angle TBG. However, for the TBG around magic angle, the sample-wide electronic Kagome lattices with tunable lattice constants are directly imaged by using scanning tunneling microscope. Our observations open a new direction to explore exotic correlated phases in moire systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In BaNiS2 a Dirac nodal-line band structure exists within a two-dimensional Ni square lattice system, in which significant electronic correlation effects are anticipated. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover signs of correlated-electron behavior, namely electronic nematicity appearing as a pair of C2-symmetry striped patterns in the local density-of-states at ~60 meV above the Fermi energy. In observations of quasiparticle interference, as well as identifying scattering between Dirac cones, we find that the striped patterns in real space stem from a lifting of degeneracy among electron pockets at the Brillouin zone boundary. We infer a momentum-dependent energy shift with d-form factor, which we model numerically within a density wave equation framework that considers spin-fluctuation-driven nematicity. This suggests an unusual mechanism driving the nematic instability, stemming from only a small perturbation to the Fermi surface, in a system with very low density of states at the Fermi energy. The Dirac points lie at nodes of the d-form factor, and are almost unaffected by it. These results highlight BaNiS2 as a unique material in which Dirac electrons and symmetry-breaking electronic correlations coexist.</p>

    <p>Quasi-two-dimensional electron systems (q-2DES) are formed in various hetero-structures, including oxide interfaces. Oxygen vacancies (OVs) in oxides like $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ are known to produce electronic carriers. A novel way to produce $\mathrm{SrTiO_{3-Œ¥}}$ on the surface using a low-energy $\mathrm{H_2}$ plasma is shown here. It results in a q-2DES with mobility as high as $Œº\sim 20,000 \; cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$, displaying quantum oscillations in magneto-resistance. We can achieve a sharper or weaker confinement potential by adjusting the process pressure. The system with sharper confinement displays clearer quantum oscillations and Kondo-like temperature dependence of resistance. OVs close to the surface behaving like a correlated Anderson impurity is responsible for the Kondo behaviour. Quantum oscillations are less prominent in the weakly confined system. A cross-over from weak-localization to anti-localization with temperature is seen, but no Kondo behavior. The process also results in a transparent conductor amenable to lithographic patterning. This conductor's standard figure of merit is comparable to poly-crystalline ITO films in the visible regime and extends with similar performance into the $Œª$ $\sim 1.5$ $Œºm$ telecommunication wavelength.</p>

    <p>Toughness $\mathcal{T}$ of a brittle polymeric solid can be enhanced by blending another compatible and ductile polymer. While this common wisdom is generally valid, a generic picture is lacking that connects the atomistic details to the macroscopic non-linear mechanics. Using all-atom and complementary generic simulations we show how a delicate balance between the side group contact density of the brittle polymers $œÅ_{\rm c}$ and its dilution upon adding a second component controls $\mathcal{T}$. A broad range of systems follows a universal trend in $\mathcal{T}$ with ${\rm d}œÅ_{\rm c}/{\rm d}\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the tensile strain. The simulation data is consistent with a simple model based on the parallel spring analogy.</p>

    <p>Coordination geometries describe how the neighbours of a central particle are arranged around it. Such geometries can be thought to lie in an abstract topological space; a model of this space could provide a mathematical basis for understanding physical transformations in crystals, liquids, and glasses. With this motivation, the present work proposes a metric model of the space of three-dimensional coordination geometries. This model is conceived through the generalisation of a local orientational order parameter and seems to be consistent with geometric intuition. It appears to suggest a taxonomy of coordination geometries with five main classes, each with a distinct character. A quantitative notion of orientational typicality is introduced and its interplay with orientational order is found to evidence a statistical regularity with respect to point symmetry. By the assertion of axioms on the topology of the space herein modelled, the range of structures that are possible to resolve with the order parameter in molecular dynamics simulations is greatly increased.</p>

    <p>In a $(2+1)$-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory coupled with a fermion and a scalar, which has $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY in absence of the boundary, the insertion of a spatial boundary breaks the supersymmetry. We show that only a subset of the boundary conditions allowed by the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian can preserve partial $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, while for the remaining boundary conditions SUSY is completely broken. In the latter case, we demonstrate two distinct SUSY-breaking mechanisms. For some of the SUSY-breaking boundary conditions, the SUSY variation of the action does not vanish which explicitly breaks SUSY. While for certain other boundary conditions, despite the invariance of action under SUSY transformations, unpaired fermionic edge states in the domain of the Hamiltonian leads to an anomalous breaking of the supersymmetry.</p>

    <p>Edible electronics will facilitate point-of-care testing through safe and cheap devices that are digested or degraded in the body or environment after performing a specific function. Its thrive depends on creating a library of materials that are the basic building blocks for eatable technologies. Edible electrical conductors fabricated with green methods that allow production at a large scale and composed of food derivatives, ingestible in large amounts without risk for human health are needed. Here, conductive pastes made with materials with a high tolerable upper intake limit (major of mg/kg body weight /day) are proposed. Conductive oleogel paste composites, made with biodegradable and food-grade materials like natural waxes, oils, and activated carbon conductive fillers, are presented. The proposed pastes are compatible with manufacturing processes such as direct ink writing and thus are suitable for an industrial scale-up. These conductors are built without the use of solvents, and with tunable electromechanical features and adhesion depending on the composition. They have antibacterial and hydrophobic properties, so that they can be used in contact with food preventing contamination and preserving its organoleptic properties. As a proof-of-principle application, the edible conductive pastes are demonstrated to be effective edible contacts for food impedance analysis, to be integrated for example in smart fruit labels for ripening monitoring.</p>

    <p>As interdisciplinary science is flourishing because of materials informatics and additional factors; a systematic way is required for expressing knowledge and facilitating communication between scientists in various fields. A function decomposition tree is such a representation, but domain scientists face difficulty in constructing it. Thus, this study cites the general problems encountered by beginners in generating function decomposition trees and proposes a new function decomposition representation method based on a causality-first perspective for resolution of these problems. The causality-first decomposition tree was obtained from a workflow expressed according to the processing sequence. Moreover, we developed a program that performed automatic conversion using the features of the causality-first decomposition trees. The proposed method was applied to materials informatics to demonstrate the systematic representation of expert knowledge and its usefullness.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Implantation of diamonds with helium ions becomes a common method to create hundreds-nanometers-thick near-surface layers of NV centers for high-sensitivity sensing and imaging applications. However, optimal implantation dose and annealing temperature is still a matter of discussion. In this study, we irradiated HPHT diamonds with an initial nitrogen concentration of 100 ppm using different implantation doses of helium ions to create 200-nm thick NV layers. We compare a previously considered optimal implantation dose of $\sim10^{12}$ to double and triple doses by measuring fluorescence intensity, contrast, and linewidth of magnetic resonances, as well as longitudinal and transversal relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. From these direct measurements we also estimate concentrations of P1 and NV centers. In addition, we compare the three diamond samples that underwent three consequent annealing steps to quantify the impact of processing at 1100 $^{\circ}$C, which follows initial annealing at 800 $^{\circ}$C. By tripling the implantation dose we have increased the magnetic sensitivity of our sensors by $28\pm5$ %. By projecting our results to higher implantation doses we show that a further improvement of up to 70 % may be achieved. At the same time, additional annealing steps at 1100 $^{\circ}$C improve the sensitivity only by 6.6 $\pm$ 2.7 %.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work, a temperature-induced valence-state transition is studied in a narrow composition range of Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$TbIrO$_6$. The valence-state transition involves an electron transfer between Tb and Ir leading to the valence-state change between Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ and Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ phases. This first-order transition has a dramatic effect on the lattice, transport properties, and the long-range magnetic order at low temperatures for both Tb and Ir ions. Ir$^{5+}$ ion has an electronic configuration of 5$d^4$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 0) which is expected to be nonmagnetic. In contrast, Ir$^{4+}$ ion with a configuration of 5$d^5$($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) favors a long-range magnetic order. For $x$ = 0.1 with Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ configuration to the lowest temperature (2 K) investigated in this work, a spin-glass behavior is observed around 5 K indicating Ir$^{5+}$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 0) ions act as a spacer reducing the magnetic interactions between Tb$^{3+}$ ions. For $x$ = 0.5 with Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ configuration below the highest temperature 400 K of this work, a long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T\rm_N$ = 40 K is observed highlighting the importance of Ir$^{4+}$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) ions in promoting the long-range magnetic order of both Tb and Ir ions. For 0.2 $\leqslant x \leqslant$ 0.375, a temperature-induced valence-state transition from high-temperature Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ phase to low-temperature Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ phase occurs in the temperature range 180 K $\leqslant T \leqslant$ 325 K and the transition temperature increases with $x$. The compositional dependence demonstrates the ability to tune the the valence state for a critical region of $x$ that leads to a concurrent change in magnetism and structure. This tuning ability could be employed with suitable strain in thin films to act as a switch as the magnetism is manipulated.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The microscopic understanding of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been hindered by the apparent complexity of crystal structures in these materials. We used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study an electron-doped copper oxide compound Sr$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$CuO$_2$ that has only bare cations separating the CuO$_2$ planes and thus the simplest infinite-layer structure among all cuprate superconductors. Tunneling conductance spectra of the major CuO$_2$ planes in the superconducting state revealed direct evidence for a nodeless pairing gap, regardless of variation of its magnitude with the local doping of trivalent neodymium. Furthermore, three distinct bosonic modes are observed as multiple peak-dip-hump features outside the superconducting gaps and their respective energies depend little on the spatially varying gaps. Along with the bosonic modes with energies identical to those of the external, bending and stretching phonons of copper oxides, our findings indicate their origin from lattice vibrations rather than spin excitations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Understanding substrate effects on spin dynamics and relaxation in two-dimensional (2D) materials is of key importance for spintronics and quantum information applications. However, the key factors that determine the substrate effect on spin relaxation, in particular for materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, have not been well understood. Here we performed first-principles real-time density-matrix dynamics simulations with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and quantum descriptions of electron-phonon and electron-impurity scattering for the spin lifetimes of supported/free-standing germanene, a prototypical strong SOC 2D Dirac material. We show that the effects of different substrates on spin lifetime can surprisingly differ by two orders of magnitude. We find that substrate effects on $œÑ_s$ are closely related to substrate-induced modifications of the SOC-field anisotropy, which changes the spin-flip scattering matrix elements. We propose a new electronic quantity, named spin-flip angle $Œ∏^{\uparrow\downarrow}$, to characterize spin relaxation caused by intervalley spin-flip scattering. We find that the spin relaxation rate is approximately proportional to the averaged value of $\mathrm{sin}^{2}\left(Œ∏^{\uparrow\downarrow}/2\right)$, which can be used as a guiding parameter of controlling spin relaxation.</p>

    <p>Graphene on hBN (G/hBN) has a long period moir√© superstructure owing to the lattice mismatch between two materials. Long periodic potential caused by the moir√© superstructure induces modulation of electronic properties of the system. In this paper, we numerically calculate optical conductivity of G/hBN under circularly polarized light irradiation. The lack of spatial inversion symmetry in G/hBN induces the valley polarization. In further, the valley polarization becomes most pronounced in the infrared and terahertz regions if the twist angle between two materials is close to zero for non-doping case, however, insensitive with twist angle for hole-doped case. These results will serve to design the valleytronics devices using G/hBN.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A new class of strongly excited plasmonic modes that open access to unprecedented Petavolts per meter electromagnetic fields promise wide-ranging, transformative impact. These modes are constituted by large amplitude oscillations of the ultradense, delocalized free electron Fermi gas which is inherent in conductive media. Here structured semiconductors with appropriate concentration of n-type dopant are introduced to tune the properties of the Fermi gas for matched excitation of an electrostatic, surface "crunch-in" plasmon using readily available electron beams of ten micron overall dimensions and hundreds of picoCoulomb charge launched inside a tube. Strong excitation made possible by matching results in relativistic oscillations of the Fermi electron gas and uncovers unique phenomena. Relativistically induced ballistic electron transport comes about due to relativistic multifold increase in the mean free path. Acquired ballistic transport also leads to unconventional heat deposition beyond the Ohm's law. This explains the absence of observed damage or solid-plasma formation in experiments on interaction of conductive samples with electron bunches shorter than $\rm 10^{-13} seconds$. Furthermore, relativistic momentum leads to copious tunneling of electron gas allowing it to traverse the surface and crunch inside the tube. Relativistic effects along with large, localized variation of Fermi gas density underlying these modes necessitate the kinetic approach coupled with particle-in-cell simulations. Experimental verification of acceleration and focusing of electron beams modeled here using tens of Gigavolts per meter fields excited in semiconductors with $\rm 10^{18}cm^{-3}$ free electron density will pave the way for Petavolts per meter plasmonics.</p>

    <p>Current pulse driven Neel vector rotation in metallic antiferromagnets is one of the most promising concepts in antiferromagnetic spintronics. We show microscopically that the Neel vector of epitaxial thin films of the prototypical compound Mn2Au can be reoriented reversibly in the complete area of cross shaped device structures using single current pulses. The resulting domain pattern with aligned staggered magnetization is long term stable enabling memory applications. We achieve this switching with low heating of 20 K, which is promising regarding fast and efficient devices without the need for thermal activation. Current polarity dependent reversible domain wall motion demonstrates a Neel spin-orbit torque acting on the domain walls.</p>

    <p>Starting from a particle system with short-range interactions, we derive a continuum model for the bending, torsion, and brittle fracture of inextensible rods moving in three-dimensional space. As the number of particles tends to infinity, it is assumed that the rod's thickness is of the same order as the interatomic distance. Fracture energy in the $Œì$-limit is expressed by an implicit cell formula, which covers different modes of fracture, including (complete) cracks, folds and torsional cracks. In special cases, the cell formula can be significantly simplified. Our approach applies e.g. to atomistic systems with Lennard-Jones-type potentials and is motivated by the research of ceramic nanowires.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Optical second harmonic generation is a second-order nonlinear process that combines two photons of a given frequency into a third photon at twice the frequency. Due to the symmetry constraints, it is widely used as a sensitive probe to detect broken inversion symmetry and local polar order. Analytical modeling of the electric-dipole SHG response is essential to extract fundamental properties of materials from experiments. However, complexity builds up dramatically in the analytical model when the probed crystal is of a low bulk crystal symmetry, with a low-symmetry surface orientation, exhibits absorption and dispersion, and consists of multiple interfaces. As a result, there is a largely uneven landscape in the literature on the SHG modeling of new materials, involving numerous approximations and a wide range of (in)accuracies, leading to a rather scattered dataset of reported SHG nonlinear susceptibility. Towards streamlining the reliability and accuracy of this process, we have developed an open-source package called the Second Harmonic Analysis of Anisotropic Rotational Polarimetry (SHAARP) which derives analytical solutions and performs numerical simulations of reflection SHG from a single interface for homogeneous crystals. Five key generalizations in SHG modeling are implemented, including all crystal symmetries down to triclinic, any crystal orientation, complex dielectric tensor (refractive indices) with frequency dispersion, and general polarization states of the light. SHAARP enables accurate anisotropic modeling of SHG response for a broad range of materials systems. The method is extendible to multiple interfaces.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Lithium salts with low coordinating anions like bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) have been the state-of-the-art for PEO-based 'dry' polymer electrolytes for three decades. Plasticizing PEO with TFSI-based ionic liquids (ILs) to form ternary solid polymer electrolytes (TSPEs) increases conductivity and Li$^+$ diffusivity. However, the Li$^+$ transport mechanism is unaffected compared to their 'dry' counterpart and essentially coupled to the dynamics of the polymer host matrix, which limits Li$^+$ transport improvement. Thus, a paradigm shift is hereby suggested: The utilization of more coordinating anions such as trifluoromethanesulfonyl-N-cyanoamide (TFSAM), able to compete with PEO for Li$^+$ solvation to accelerate the Li$^+$ transport and reach higher Li$^+$ transference number. The Li-TFSAM interaction in binary and ternary TFSAM-based electrolytes was probed by experimental methods and discussed in the context of recent computational results. In PEO-based TSPEs, TFSAM drastically accelerates the Li$^+$ transport (increased Li$^+$ transference number by 600$\%$ and Li$^+$ conductivity by 200-300$\%$) and computer simulations reveal that lithium dynamics are effectively re-coupled from polymer to anion dynamics. Finally, this concept of coordinating anions in TSPEs was successfully applied in LFP$||$Li metal cells leading to enhanced capacity retention (86$\%$ after 300 cycles) and an improved rate performance at 2C.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A quantum anomalous Hall state with high Chern number has so far been realized in multiplayer structures consisting of alternating magnetic and undoped topological insulator layers. However, in previous proposals, the Chern number can be only tuned by varying the doping concentration or the width of the magnetic topological insulator layers. This drawback largely restrict the applications of dissipationless chiral edge currents in electronics since the number of conducting channels remains fixed. In this work, we propose a way of varying the Chern number at will in these multilayered structures by means of an external electric field applied along the stacking direction. In the presence of an electric field in the stacking direction, the inverted bands of the unbiased structure coalesce and hybridize, generating new inverted bands and collapsing the previously inverted ones. In this way, the number of Chern states can be tuned externally in the sample, without the need of modifying the number and width of the layers or the doping level. We showed that this effect can be uncovered by the variation of the transverse conductance as a function of the electric field at constant injection energy at the Fermi level.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Nanometric metallic stripes allow the transmission of optical signals via the excitation and propagation of surface-localized evanescent electromagnetic waves, with important applications in the field of nano-photonics. Whereas this kind of plasmonic phenomena typically exploits noble metals, like Ag or Au, other materials can exhibit viable light-transport efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate the transport of visible light in nanometric niobium stripes coupled with a dielectric polymeric layer, exploiting the remotely-excited/detected Raman signal of black phosphorus (bP) as the probe. The light-transport mechanism is ascribed to the generation of surface plasmon polaritons at the Nb/polymer interface. The propagation length is limited due to the lossy nature of niobium in the optical range, but this material may allow the exploitation of specific functionalities that are absent in noble-metal counterparts.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We investigate the effect of spatial doping of the Mott insulator LaVO$_3$ by inserting a few layers of the correlated metal SrVO$_3$ in multilayer geometries. Using density functional theory in combination with dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that this leads to a geometrically confined and robust metallic layer that stabilizes the metallicity in SrVO$_3$ even in the ultrathin layer limit, suppressing a potential dimensionality-induced metal-insulator transition. For a thicker SrVO$_3$ layer, we find a continuous transition of both structural and electronic properties across the interface between the two materials, with bulk properties reestablished on a length scale of 2-3 unit cells away from the interface. We show that a strain modulation applied along the growth direction can lead to asymmetric charge reconstruction at chemically symmetric interfaces. However, we find that this effect is rather weak, implying that fractional occupancy, and thus metallicity, persists at the interfaces.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topological Interlocking Structures (TIS) have been increasingly studied in the past two decades. However, some fundamental questions concerning the effects of Young's modulus and the friction coefficient on the structural mechanics of the most common type of TIS application - centrally loaded slabs - are not yet clear. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind parametric study based on the Level-Set-Discrete-element-Method that aims to clarify how these two parameters affect multiple aspects of the behavior and failure of centrally-loaded TIS slabs. This includes the evolution of the structural response up to and including failure, the foremost structural response parameters, and the residual carrying capacity. We find that the structural response parameters in TIS slabs scale linearly with Young's modulus, that they saturate with the friction coefficient, and that the saturated response provides an upper-bound on the capacity of centrally loaded TIS slabs reported in the literature. This, together with additional findings, insights, and observations, comprise a novel contribution to our understanding of the interlocked structural form.</p>

    <p>We present a study on the trapping of hard ferromagnetic particles using alternating magnetic fields, with a focus on planar trap geometries. First, we realize and characterize a magnetic Paul trap design for millimeter-size magnets based on a rotating magnetic potential. Employing a physically rotating platform with two pairs of permanent magnets with opposite poles, we show stable trapping of hard ferromagnets a centimeter above the trap and demonstrate that the particle shape plays a critical role in the trapping.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The magnetic subsystem of nabokoite, KCu$_7$(TeO$_4$)(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, is constituted by copper ions forming a buckled square kagom√© lattice decorated by quasi-isolated ions. This combination determines peculiar physical properties of this compound evidenced in electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$, magnetization $M$ and specific heat $C_p$ measurements. At lowering temperature, the magnetic susceptibility $œá= M/H$ passes through a broad hump inherent for low-dimensional magnetic systems at about 150 K and a sharp peak at antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N = 3.2 $K. The $C_p(T,H)$ curves demonstrate additional peak-like anomaly at $T_{peak}= 5.7$K robust to magnetic field. The latter can be ascribed to low-lying singlet excitations filling the singlet-triplet gap in magnetic excitation spectrum of the square kagom√© lattice [J.Richter, O.Derzhko and J.Schnack, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{105} (2022) 144427]. ESR spectroscopy provides indications that antiferromagnetic structure below $T_N$ is non-collinear. Separate issue is the observation of antiferroelectric-type behavior in $\varepsilon$ at low temperatures, which tentatively reduces the symmetry and partially lifts frustration of magnetic interactions of decorating copper ions with buckled square kagom√© lattice. These complex thermodynamic and resonant properties signal the presence of two weakly coupled magnetic subsystems in nabokoite, namely a spin-liquid in square kagom√© lattice layers and an antiferromagnet represented by decorating ions.</p>

    <p>MXenes are a class of 2D/layered materials which are highly conductive, hydrophilic, have a large electrochemical surface area and are easily processible into electrodes for energy applications. Since the discovery of MXenes over ten years ago, these materials have been mainly used in the preparation of electrodes for batteries and supercapacitors. However, due to their aforementioned properties, MXenes could potentially be utilised as a component in the catalyst layer for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). This opinion piece will discuss some of the recent literature in the area of hybrid catalysts consisting of various Transition Metal Oxides (TMOs) and MXenes for the OER.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Elemental mapping images can be achieved through step scanning imaging using pinhole optics or micro pore optics (MPO), or alternatively by full-field X-ray fluorescence imaging (FF-XRF). X-ray optics for FF-XRF can be manufactured with different micro-channel geometries such as square, hexagonal or circular channels. Each optic geometry creates different imaging artefacts. Square-channel MPOs generate a high intensity central spot due to two reflections via orthogonal channel walls inside a single channel, which is the desirable part for image formation, and two perpendicular lines forming a cross due to reflections in one plane only.
  Thus, we have studied the performance of a square-channel MPO in an FF-XRF imaging system. The setup consists of a commercially available MPO provided by Photonis and a Timepix3 readout chip with a silicon detector. Imaging of fluorescence from small metal particles has been used to obtain the point spread function (PSF) characteristics. The transmission through MPO channels and variation of the critical reflection angle are characterized by measurements of fluorescence from Copper and Titanium metal fragments. Since the critical angle of reflection is energy dependent, the cross-arm artefacts will affect the resolution differently for different fluorescence energies. It is possible to identify metal fragments due to the form of the PSF function. The PSF function can be further characterized using a Fourier transform to suppress diffuse background signals in the image.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topological physics has revolutionised materials science, introducing topological insulators and superconductors with applications from smart materials to quantum computing. Bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) is a core concept therein, where the non-trivial topology of a material's bulk predicts localized topological states at its boundaries. However, edge states also exist in systems where BBC is seemingly violated, leaving any topological origin unknown. For finite-frequency mechanical metamaterials, BBC has hitherto been described in terms of displacements, necessitating fixed boundaries to identify topologically protected edge modes. Herein, we introduce a new family of finite-frequency mechanical metamaterials whose topological properties emerge in strain coordinates for free boundaries. We show two examples, the first being the canonical mass-dimer, where BBC in strain coordinates reveals the previously unknown topological origin of its edge modes. Second, we introduce a new mechanical analog of the Majorana-supporting Kitaev chain. We theoretically and experimentally show that this Kitaev chain supports edge states for both free and fixed boundaries, wherein BBC is established in strains and displacements, respectively. Our findings suggest a previously undiscovered class of topological edge modes may exist, including within other settings such as electrical circuits and optics, and for more complex, tailored boundaries with coordinates other than strain.</p>

    <p>In a magnetic texture, the spin of a conduction electron is forced to be aligned to the localized moment. As a result, the topology of the magnetic texture affects the electron dynamics in nontrivial ways. A representative example is the topological Hall effect in noncoplanar spin textures with finite spin chirality. While propagating in the noncoplanar spin texture, electrons acquire Berry phase, and their motion is deflected as if they were in a magnetic field. Here, we report a distinct Berry phase effect in a coplanar helimagnet: the spin moment of the conduction electron is polarized under electric currents depending on the chirality of the helimagnet. The accumulated spin polarization works as a source of spin current, and the chirality can be detected by the inverse spin Hall mechanism. The functionality allows us to read out the chirality without magnetic fields, and therefore paves the way to future helimagnet-based spintronics.</p>

    <p>The variational quantum eigensolver is a promising way to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computer, while its success relies on a well-designed wavefunction ansatz. Compared to physically motivated ansatzes, hardware heuristic ansatzes usually lead to a shallower circuit, but it may still be too deep for an NISQ device. Inspired by the quantum neural network, we propose a new hardware heuristic ansatz where the circuit depth can be significantly reduced by introducing ancilla qubits, which makes a practical simulation of a chemical reaction with more than 20 atoms feasible on a currently available quantum computer. More importantly, the expressibility of this new ansatz can be improved by increasing either the depth or the width of the circuit, which makes it adaptable to different hardware environments. These results open a new avenue to develop practical applications of quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The interplay between dimensionality and various phases of matter is a central inquiry in condensed matter physics. New phases are often discovered through spontaneously broken symmetry. Understanding the dimensionality of superconductivity in the high-temperature cuprate analogue $-$ layered nickelates and revealing a new symmetry-breaking state are the keys to deciphering the underlying pairing mechanism. Here, we demonstrate the highly-tunable dimensionality and a broken rotational symmetry state in the superconductivity of square-planar layered nickelates. The superconducting state, probed by superconducting critical current and magnetoresistance within superconducting transition under direction-dependent in-plane magnetic fields, exhibits a $C_2$ rotational symmetry which breaks the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of the square-planar lattice. Furthermore, by performing detailed examination of the angular dependent upper critical fields at temperatures down to 0.5 K with high-magnetic pulsed-fields, we observe a crossover from two-dimensional to three-dimensional superconducting states which can be manipulated by the ionic size fluctuations in the rare-earth spacer layer. Such a large degree of controllability is desired for tailoring strongly two/three-dimensional superconductors and navigating various pairing landscapes for a better understanding of the correlation between reduced dimensionality and unconventional pairing. These results illuminate new directions to unravel the high-temperature superconducting pairing mechanism.</p>

    <p>The kagome metal CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ features an unusual competition between the charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) inside the CDW phase has been accumulating. Hence, the superconductivity in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ emerges from a TRSB normal state, potentially resulting in an exotic superconducting state. To reveal the pairing symmetry, we first investigate the effect of nonmagnetic impurity. Our results show that the superconducting critical temperature is insensitive to disorder, pointing to conventional $s$-wave superconductivity. Moreover, our measurements of the self-field critical current ($I_{c,sf}$), which is related to the London penetration depth, also confirm conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with strong coupling. Finally, we measure $I_{c,sf}$ where the CDW order is removed by pressure and superconductivity emerges from the pristine normal state. Our results show that $s$-wave gap symmetry is retained, providing strong evidence for the presence of conventional $s$-wave superconductivity in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ irrespective of the presence of the TRSB</p>

    <p>Metal surface cleaning or etching techniques using reactive plasma are emerging as one of the dry processing techniques for surface contaminants with high bond energy, especially for cleaning and decontamination of nuclear components and equipment. In this study, the plasma reaction due to the discharge of a dielectric barrier of a mixture of 95% helium and 5% fluorine with cobalt oxide film grown on the surface of stainless steel 304 was studied experimentally. Experimental results show that cobalt oxide becomes a powder after plasma irradiation and is easily separated from the surface of the base metal. The optimal plasma generating conditions of the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) used in this experimental study were obtained at atmospheric pressure, voltage 4.5 kV, and frequency 25 kHz with a etching rate of 10.875 Œºmol/min. The samples were analyzed before and after plasma irradiation, using Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and the purification rate was performed using a sequential weighting of the samples with scales 10^(-4) grams accurately obtained. The results show the ability of this method to effectively remove the surface contamination of cobalt from the surface of stainless steel 304.</p>

    <p>Graphene is an ideal platform to study the coherence of quantum interference pathways by tuning doping or laser excitation energy. The latter produces a Raman excitation profile that provides direct insight into the lifetimes of intermediate electronic excitations and, therefore, on quantum interference, which has so far remained elusive. Here, we control the Raman scattering pathways by tuning the laser excitation energy in graphene doped up to 1.05eV, above what achievable with electrostatic doping. The Raman excitation profile of the G mode indicates its position and full width at half maximum are linearly dependent on doping. Doping-enhanced electron-electron interactions dominate the lifetime of Raman scattering pathways, and reduce Raman interference. This paves the way for engineering quantum pathways in doped graphene, nanotubes and topological insulators.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A rigorous account of quantum nonlocal effects is paramount for understanding the optical response of metal nanostructures and for designing plasmonic devices at the nanoscale. Here, we present a scheme for retrieving the quantum surface response of metals, encapsulated in the Feibelman $d$-parameters, from electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. We theoretically demonstrate that quantum nonlocal effects have a dramatic impact on EELS and CL spectra, in the guise of spectral shifts and nonlocal damping, when either the system size or the inverse wave vector in extended structures approach the nanometer scale. Our concept capitalizes on the unparalleled ability of free-electrons to supply deeply subwavelength near-fields and, thus, probe the optical response of metals at length scales in which quantum-mechanical effects are apparent. These results pave the way for a widespread use of the $d$-parameter formalism, thereby facilitating a rigorous yet practical inclusion of nonclassical effects in nanoplasmonics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The discovery of efficient magnetization switching activated by the spin Hall effect (SHE)-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) changed the course of magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) research and development. However, for systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), the use of SOT is still hampered by the necessity of a longitudinal magnetic field to break the magnetic symmetry to achieve deterministic switching. In this work, we first demonstrate that a robust and tunable field-free current-driven SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization can be controlled by the growth protocol in Pt-based magnetic heterostructures. It is further elucidated that such growth-dependent symmetry breaking is originated from the laterally tilted magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnetic layer with PMA, which has been largely neglected in previous studies and its critical role should be re-focused. We show by both experiments and simulations that in a PMA system with tilted anisotropy, the deterministic field-free switching possesses a conventional SHE-induced damping-like torque feature and the resulting current-induced effective field has a non-linear dependence on the applied current density, which could be potentially misattributed to an unconventional SOT origin.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Diamond is generally considered to have high thermal conductivity, so little attention has been paid to the laser heating effects at low excitation power. However, defects during the growth process can result in a great degradation of thermal conductivity, especially at low temperatures. Here, we observed the dynamic redshift and broadening of zero phonon line (ZPL) of silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamondin the experiment. Utilizing the intrinsic temperature response of the fine structure spectra of SiV as a probe, we confirmed that the laser heating effect appears and the temperature rising results from high defect concentration. By simulating the thermal diffusion process, we have estimated the thermal conductivity of around 1 W/(mK) at the local site, which is a two order magnitude lower than that of single-crystal diamond. Our results provide a feasible scheme for characterizing the laser heating effect of diamond at low temperatures.</p>

    <p>We theoretically investigated the topological-protected edge states (TESs) in an anisotropic honeycomb lattice with mirror and chiral symmetries, characterized by an alternative topological invariant - fractional polarization (FP), rather than the conventional Chern number. This system termed an FP insulator is a potential platform for edge-state engineering due to its disconnected TESs. These disconnected and robust TESs are susceptible to perturbative chiral symmetry-breaking terms which can generate various patterns including the vanishing helical, spin-polarized, and chiral TESs. Moreover, helical and chiral TES can be achieved by the finite size effect, not possible from the aforementioned terms alone. The demonstration of these various TES in an FP-insulator offers an alternative route in designing reconfigurable two-dimensional nanoelectronic devices.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Modification of titanium microstructure after propagation of a melting shock wave (SW) generated by a femtosecond laser pulse is investigated experimentally and analyzed using hydrodynamic and atomistic simulations. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy with analysis of microdiffraction is used to determine the microstructure of subsurface layers of pure titanium sample before and after modification. We found that two layers of modified titanium are formed beneath the surface. A top surface polycrystalline layer of nanoscale grains is formed from a shock-molten layer via rapid crystallization. In a deeper subsurface layer, where the shock-induced melting becomes impossible due attenuation of SW, recrystallization of plastically deformed titanium leads to grain size changes in comparison with intact titanium. Molecular dynamics simulation of single-crystal titanium reveals that the SW front continues to melt/liquefy even after its temperature drops below the melting curve $T_m(P)$. The enormous shear stress generated in a narrow SW front leads to collapse/amorphization of the crystal lattice and formation of a supercooled metastable melt. Such melt crystallizes in an unloading tail of SW until its temperature becomes higher than $T_m(P)$ due to a rapid pressure drop. Later, crystallization of the subsurface molten layer will continue after the heat leaves it. After the shear stress drops below $\sim 12$GPa within the SW front, such the cold mechanical melting ceases giving place to the shock-induced plastic deformations. The depth of modification is limited by SW attenuation to the Hugoniot elastic limit, and can reach several micrometers. The obtained results reveal the basic physical mechanisms of surface hardening of metals by ultrashort laser pulses.</p>

    <p>The study of the electronic properties of charged defects is crucial for our understanding of various electrical properties of materials. However, the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) hinders the research on large defect models. In this study, we present an E(3) equivariant graph neural network framework (HamGNN-Q), which can predict the tight-binding Hamiltonian matrices for various defect types with different charges using only one set of network parameters. By incorporating features of background charge into the element representation, HamGNN-Q enables a direct mapping from structure and background charge to the electronic Hamiltonian matrix of charged defect systems without DFT calculation. We demonstrate the model's high precision and transferability through testing on GaAs systems with various charged defect configurations. Our approach provides a practical solution for accelerating charged defect electronic structure calculations and advancing the design of materials with tailored electronic properties.</p>

    <p>With the development of high-speed electron detectors, four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing microstructures in material science and life science. However, the complexity of 4D-STEM data processing necessitates an intuitive graphical user interface software for researchers. In this regard, we have developed 4D-Explorer, an open-source, lightweight and extensible software for processing 4D-STEM data. It offers a visual and interactive workflow, including data preparation, calibration, image reconstruction and generating quantitative results. Furthermore, during calibration, our software includes a novel algorithm for rotational offset correction that uses a defocused 4D-STEM dataset and its axial bright field image, which has lower experimental requirements than conventional methods. We anticipate that 4D-Explorer will help researchers harness the capabilities of 4D-STEM technology.</p>

    <p>We investigate the adiabatic approximation to the exact-exchange kernel for calculating correlation energies within the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation framework of time-dependent density functional theory. A numerical study is performed on a set of systems having bonds of different character (H$_2$ and N$_2$ molecules, H-chain, H$_2$-dimer, solid-Ar and the H$_2$O-dimer). We find that the adiabatic kernel can be sufficient in strongly bound covalent systems, yielding similar bond lengths and binding energies. However, for non-covalent systems the adiabatic kernel introduces significant errors around equilibrium geometry, systematically overestimating the interaction energy. The origin of this behaviour is investigated by studying a model dimer composed of one-dimensional closed-shell atoms interacting via soft-Coulomb potentials. The kernel is shown to exhibit a strong frequency dependence at small to intermediate atomic separation that affects both the low-energy spectrum and the exchange-correlation hole obtained from the corresponding diagonal of the two-particle density matrix.</p>

    <p>We investigate the correlated state of Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ using neutron scattering, finding signatures of correlations of both dipolar and octupolar character. A dipolar inelastic signal is also observed, as expected for spinons in a quantum spin ice (QSI). Fits of thermodynamic data using exact diagonalization methods indicate that the largest interaction is an octupolar exchange, with a strength roughly twice as large as other terms. A hierarchy of exchange interactions with dominant octupolar and significant dipolar exchange, still in the octupolar QSI phase, rationalises neutron scattering observations. Our results reveal a `quantum multipolar liquid' where correlations involve multiple terms in moment series expansion, opening questions about their intertwining and possible hierarchy.</p>

    <p>The spatially nonlocal response functions of graphene obtained on the basis of first principles of quantum field theory using the polarization tensor are considered in the areas of both the on-the-mass-shell and off-the-mass-shell waves. It s shown that at zero frequency the longitudinal permittivity of graphene is the regular function, whereas the transverse one possesses a double pole for any nonzero wave vector. According to our results, both the longitudinal and transverse permittivities satisfy the dispersion (Kramers-Kronig) relations connecting their real and imaginary parts, as well as expressing each of these permittivities along the imaginary frequency axis via its imaginary part. For the transverse permittivity, the form of an additional term arising in the dispersion relations due to the presence of a double pole is found. The form of dispersion relations is unaffected by the branch points which arise on the real frequency axis in the presence of spatial nonlocality. The obtained results are discussed in connection with the well known problem of the Lifshitz theory which was found to be in conflict with the measurement data when using the much studied response function of metals. A possible way of attack on this problem based on the case of graphene is suggested.</p>

    <p>Proton tunneling is believed to be non-local in ice but has never been shown experimentally. Here we measured thermal conductivity of ice under pressure up to 50 GPa and found it to increase with pressure until 20 GPa but decrease at higher pressures. We attribute this anomalous drop of thermal conductivity to the collective tunneling of protons at high pressures, supported by large-scale quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The collective tunneling loops span several picoseconds in time and are as large as nanometers in space, which match the phonon periods and wavelengths, leading to strong phonon scattering at high pressures. Our results show direct evidence of collective quantum motion existing in high-pressure ice and provide a new perspective to understanding the coupling between phonon propagation and atomic tunneling.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In material research, structural characterization often requires multiple complementary techniques to obtain a holistic morphological view of the synthesized material. Depending on the availability of and accessibility of the different characterization techniques (e.g., scattering, microscopy, spectroscopy), each research facility or academic research lab may have access to high-throughput capability in one technique but face limitations (sample preparation, resolution, access time) with other techniques(s). Furthermore, one type of structural characterization data may be easier to interpret than another (e.g., microscopy images are easier to interpret than small angle scattering profiles). Thus, it is useful to have machine learning models that can be trained on paired structural characterization data from multiple techniques so that the model can generate one set of characterization data from the other. In this paper we demonstrate one such machine learning workflow, PairVAE, that works with data from Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) that presents information about bulk morphology and images from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) that presents two-dimensional local structural information of the sample. Using paired SAXS and SEM data of novel block copolymer assembled morphologies [open access data from Doerk G.S., et al. Science Advances. 2023 Jan 13;9(2): eadd3687], we train our PairVAE. After successful training, we demonstrate that the PairVAE can generate SEM images of the block copolymer morphology when it takes as input that sample's corresponding SAXS 2D pattern, and vice versa. This method can be extended to other soft materials morphologies as well and serves as a valuable tool for easy interpretation of 2D SAXS patterns as well as creating a database for other downstream calculations of structure-property relationships.</p>

    <p>Particulate air pollution is taking a huge toll on modern society, being associated with more than three million deaths per year. In addition, airborne infectious microorganism can spread dangerous diseases, further elevating the problem. A common way to mitigate the risks of airborne particles is by air filtration. However, conventional air filters usually do not provide any functionality beyond particle removal. They are unable to inactivate accumulated contaminants and therefore need periodic maintenance and replacement to remain operational and safe. This work presents a multifunctional, self-cleaning air filtration system which utilizes a novel graphene-enhanced air filter medium (GeFM). The hybrid network of the GeFM combines the passive structure-based air filtration properties of an underlying ceramic network with additional active features based on the functional properties of a graphene thin film. The GeFM is able to capture >95 % of microorganisms and particles larger than 1 $Œº$m and can be repetitively Joule-heated to >300 ¬∞C for several hours without signs of degradation. Hereby, built-up organic particulate matter and microbial contaminants are effectively decomposed, regenerating the GeFM. Additionally, the GeFM provides unique options to monitor the filter's air troughput and loading status during operation. The active features of the GeFM can drastically improve filter life-time and safety, offering great potential for the development of safer and more sustainable air filtration solutions to face the future challenges of air pollution and pandemics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Point clouds are versatile representations of 3D objects and have found widespread application in science and engineering. Many successful deep-learning models have been proposed that use them as input. The domain of chemical and materials modeling is especially challenging because exact compliance with physical constraints is highly desirable for a model to be usable in practice. These constraints include smoothness and invariance with respect to translations, rotations, and permutations of identical atoms. If these requirements are not rigorously fulfilled, atomistic simulations might lead to absurd outcomes even if the model has excellent accuracy. Consequently, dedicated architectures, which achieve invariance by restricting their design space, have been developed. General-purpose point-cloud models are more varied but often disregard rotational symmetry. We propose a general symmetrization method that adds rotational equivariance to any given model while preserving all the other requirements. Our approach simplifies the development of better atomic-scale machine-learning schemes by relaxing the constraints on the design space and making it possible to incorporate ideas that proved effective in other domains. We demonstrate this idea by introducing the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, which is not intrinsically equivariant but achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets of molecules and solids. A-posteriori application of our general protocol makes PET exactly equivariant, with minimal changes to its accuracy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Use of electrode materials that show phase change behavior and hence drastic changes in electrochemical activity during operation, have not been explored for Li-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the vanadium oxide (VO2) cathode that undergoes metal-insulator transition due to first-order structural phase transition at accessible temperature of 68¬∞C for battery operation. Using a suitable electrolyte operable across the phase transition range and compatible with vanadium oxide cathodes, we studied the effect of electrode structure change on lithium insertion followed by the electrochemical characteristics above and below the phase transition temperature. The high-temperature VO2 phase shows significantly improved capacitance, enhanced current rate capabilities, improved electrical conductivity and lithium-ion diffusivity compared to the insulating low temperature phase. This opens up new avenues for electrode designs, allowing manipulation of electrochemical reactions around phase transition temperatures, and in particular enhancing electrochemical properties at elevated temperatures contrary to existing classes of battery chemistries that lead to performance deterioration at elevated temperatures.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this article, we report the results of relatively facile fabrication of carbon nanodots from single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT and MWCNT). The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman measurements show that the obtained carbon nanodots are quasi-two-dimensional objects with a diamond-like structure. Based on the characterization results, a theoretical model of synthesized carbon nanodots was developed. The measured absorption spectra demonstrate the similarity of the local atomic structure of carbon nanodots synthesized from single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. However, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of nanodots synthesized from both sources turned out to be completely different. Carbon dots fabricated from MWCNTs exhibit PL spectra similar to nanoscale carbon systems with sp3 hybridization and a valuable edge contribution. At the same time nanodots synthesized from SWCNTs exhibit PL spectra which are typical for quantum dots with an estimated size of ~0.6-1.3 nm.</p>

    <p>We performed spin-, time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (STARPES) of excitons prepared by photoexcitation of inversion-symmetric 2H-WSe$_2$ with circularly polarized light. The very short probing depth of XUV photoemission permits selective measurement of photoelectrons originating from the top-most WSe$_2$ layer, allowing for direct measurement of hidden spin polarization of bright and momentum-forbidden dark excitons. Our results reveal efficient chiroptical control of bright excitons' hidden spin polarization. Following optical photoexcitation, intervalley scattering between nonequivalent K-K' valleys leads to a decay of bright excitons' hidden spin polarization. Conversely, the ultrafast formation of momentum-forbidden dark excitons acts as a local spin polarization reservoir, which could be used for spin injection in van der Waals heterostructures involving multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

    <p>Solutions of macromolecules can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form droplets with ultra-low surface tension. Droplets with such low surface tension wet and spread over common surfaces such as test tubes and microscope slides, complicating \textit{in vitro} experiments. Development of an universal super-repellent surface for macromolecular droplets has remained elusive because their ultra-low surface tension requires low surface energies. Furthermore, nonwetting of droplets containing proteins poses additional challenges because the surface must remain inert to a wide range of chemistries presented by the various amino-acid side-chains at the droplet surface. Here, we present a method to coat microscope slides with a thin transparent hydrogel that exhibits complete dewetting (contact angles $Œ∏\approx180^\circ)$ and minimal pinning of phase-separated droplets in aqueous solution. The hydrogel is based on a swollen matrix of chemically crosslinked polyethylene glycol diacrylate of molecular weight 12 kDa (PEGDA), and can be prepared with basic chemistry lab equipment. The PEGDA hydrogel is a powerful tool for \textit{in vitro} studies of weak interactions, dynamics, and internal organization of phase-separated droplets in aqueous solutions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has established that for cubic network phases in diblock copolymer melts, the double-gyroid (DG) is thermodynamically stable relative to the competitor double-diamond (DD) and double-primitive (DP) phases, and exhibits a window of stability intermediate to the classical lamellar and columnar phases. This competition is widely thought to be controlled by "packing frustration" -- the incompatibility of uniformly filling melts with a locally preferred chain packing motif. Here, we reassess the thermodynamics of cubic network formation in strongly-segregated diblock melts, based on a recently developed medial strong segregation theory ("mSST") approach that directly connects the shape and thermodynamics of chain packing environments to the medial geometry of tubular network surfaces. We first show that medial packing significantly relaxes prior SST upper bounds on the free energy of network phases, which we attribute to the spreading of terminal chain ends within network nodal regions. Exploring geometric and thermodynamic metrics of chain packing in network phases, we show that mSST reproduces effects dependent on the elastic asymmetry of the blocks that are consistent with SCFT at large $œáN$. We then characterize geometric frustration in terms of the spatially-variant distributions of local entropic and enthalpic costs throughout the morphologies, extracted from mSST predictions. We find that the DG morphology, due to its unique medial geometry in the nodal regions, is stabilized by the incorporation of favorable, quasi-lamellar packing over much of its morphology, motifs which are inaccessible to DD and DP morphologies due to "interior corners" in their medial geometries. Finally, we use our results to analyze "hot spots" of chain stretching and discuss implications for network susceptibility to the uptake of guest molecules.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have synthesized high-quality single crystal samples of the erbium-based triangular lattice compound Ba3Er(BO3)3. Thermal and magnetic measurements reveal large anisotropy and a possible phase transition at 100 mK. The low-temperature magnetic heat capacity can be understood from the two Wyckoff positions that the magnetic ions Er3+ occupy, which have distinct symmetry properties and crystal field environments. A point charge calculation for the crystal electric field levels is consistent with this understanding. Based on symmetry analysis and classical simulation, we argue that Ba3Er(BO3)3 realizes an interesting two-sublattice exchange physics, in which the honeycomb lattice spins develop ferromagnetic correlations due to the additional spins at the hexagon centers but eventually order antiferromagnetically. Additionally, our results suggest that quantum fluctuations need to be considered in order to fully explain the experimental observations.</p>

    <p>Altermagnet (AM) is a novel time reversal symmetry broken magnetic phase with $d$-wave order which has been experimentally realized recently. We discuss theoretical models of altermagnet based systems on lattice and in continuum. We show equivalence between the lattice and continuum models by mapping the respective parameters. We study (i) altermagnet-normal metal (NM) and (ii) altermagnet-ferromagnet (FM) junctions, with the aim to quantify transport properties such as conductivity and magnetoresistance. We find that a spin current accompanies charge current when a bias is applied. The magnetoresistance of AM-FM junction switches sign when AM is rotated by $90^{\circ}$ -- a feature unique to the altermagnetic phase.</p>

    <p>In this work we investigate the role of exciton resonances in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (er-CARS) in single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We drive the nanotube system in simultaneous phonon and excitonic resonances, where we observe a superior enhancement by orders of magnitude exceeding non-resonant cases. We investigated the resonant effects in five $(n,m)$ chiralities and find that the er-CARS intensity varies drastically between different nanotube species. The experimental results are compared with a perturbation theory model. Finally, we show that such giant resonant non-linear signals enable rapid mapping and local heating of individualized CNTs, suggesting easy tracking of CNTs for future nanotoxology studies and therapeutic application in biological tissues.</p>

    <p>Ubiquitous in most superconducting materials and a common result of nanofabrication processes, weak-links are known for their limiting effects on the transport of electric currents. Still, they are at the root of key features of superconducting technology. By performing quantitative magneto-optical imaging experiments and thermomagnetic model simulations, we correlate the existence of local maxima in the magnetization loops of FIB-patterned Nb films to a magnetic field-induced weak-to-strong-link transformation increasing their critical current. This phenomenon arises from the nanoscale interaction between quantized magnetic flux lines and FIB-induced modifications of the device microstructure. Under an ac drive field, this leads to a rectified vortex motion along the weak-link. The reported tunable effect can be exploited in the development of new superconducting electronic devices, such as flux pumps and valves, to attenuate or amplify the supercurrent through a circuit element, and as a strategy to enhance the critical current in weak-link-bearing devices.</p>

    <p>The pressure-induced color change in the nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride has triggered extensive discussions about the underlying physics. Here, we study the optical response of LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$ in a broad frequency range at ambient pressure and its evolution with pressure in the visible spectral range. The broad-band optical spectra at ambient pressure reveal a Drude component associated with intra-band electronic transitions and two Lorentz components (L1 and L2) arising from inter-band electronic transitions. The application of pressure causes a spectral weight transfer from L1 to the Drude component, leading to a blue shift of the plasma edge in the reflectivity spectrum alongside a reduction of the high-frequency reflectivity. Our results suggest that the pressure-induced color change in LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$ is closely related to the transformation between intra- and inter-band electronic transitions, providing new insights into the mechanism of the pressure-induced color change in LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$.</p>

    <p>Ordered electronic states have been extensively explored in cuprates and iron-based unconventional superconductors, but seldom observed in the epitaxial FeSe/SrTiO3(001) monolayer (FeSe/STO) with an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc). Here, by using scanning tunneling microscopy/ spectroscopy (STM/STS), we reveal a checkerboard charge order in the epitaxial FeSe/STO monolayer, with a period of four times the inter-Fe-atom distance along two perpendicular directions of the Fe lattice. This ordered state is uniquely present in the superconducting FeSe/STO monolayer, even at liquid nitrogen temperature, but absent in the non-superconducting FeSe monolayer or bilayer. Quasiparticle interference (QPI) measurements further confirm it as a static order without an energy-dependent dispersion and gapped out within the superconductivity gap. The intensity of the charge order shows an enhancement near the superconducting transition temperature, thus implying a correlation with the high-Tc superconductivity in the FeSe/STO monolayer. This study provides a new basis for exploring the ordered electronic states and their interplay with high-Tc superconductivity in the FeSe monolayer.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Motivated by unexpected reports of a 26 K superconducting transition in elemental titanium at high pressure, we carry out an accurate ab-initio study of its properties to understand the rationale for this observation. The critical superconducting temperatures (Tc's) predicted under the assumption of a phononic pairing mechanism are found to be significantly lower than those experimentally observed. We argue that this disagreement cannot be explained by an unconventional coupling, as previously suggested, or by the existence of competing metastable structural phases. As a physically meaningful hypothesis to reconcile experimental and theoretical results, we assume the presence of Ti vacancies in the lattice. Our first-principles calculations indeed show that lattice vacancies can cause pressure dependent phonon softening and substantially increase the electron-phonon coupling at high pressure, yielding computed Tc's in agreement with the experimental measurements over the full pressure range from 150 to 300 GPa. We expect the proposed Tc enhancement mechanism to occur on a general basis in simple high-symmetry metals for various types of defects.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A major challenge in the development of quantum technologies is to induce additional types of ferroic orders into materials that exhibit other useful quantum properties. Various techniques have been applied to this end, such as elastically straining, doping, or interfacing a compound with other materials. Plastic deformation introduces permanent topological defects and large local strains into a material, which can give rise to qualitatively new functionality. Here we show via local magnetic imaging that plastic deformation induces robust magnetism in the quantum paraelectric SrTiO3, in both conducting and insulating samples. Our analysis indicates that the magnetic order is localized along dislocation walls and coexists with polar order along the walls. The magnetic signals can be switched on and off in a controllable manner with external stress, which demonstrates that plastically deformed SrTiO3 is a quantum multiferroic. These results establish plastic deformation as a versatile platform for quantum materials engineering.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We review the topological gauge theory of Josephson junction arrays and thin film superconductors, stressing the role of the usually forgotten quantum phase slips, and we derive their quantum phase structure. A quantum phase transition from a superconducting to the dual, superinsulating phase with infinite resistance (even at finite temperatures) is either direct or goes through an intermediate bosonic topological insulator phase, which is typically also called Bose metal. We show how, contrary to a widely held opinion, disorder is not relevant for the electric response in these quantum phases because excitations in the spectrum are either symmetry-protected or neutral due to confinement. The quantum phase transitions are driven only by the electric interaction growing ever stronger. First, this prevents Bose condensation, upon which out-of-condensate charges and vortices form a topological quantum state owing to mutual statistics interactions. Then, at even stronger couplings, an electric flux tube dual to Abrikosov vortices induces a linearly confining potential between charges, giving rise to superinsulation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is an antisymmetric exchange interaction, which is responsible for the formation of topologically protected spin textures in chiral magnets. Here, by measuring the dispersion relation of the DM energy, we quantify the atomistic DMI in a model system, i.e., a Co double layer on Ir(001). We unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a chirality-inverted DMI, i.e., a sign change in the chirality index of DMI from negative to positive, when comparing the interaction between nearest neighbors to that between neighbors located at longer distances. The effect is in analogy to the change in the character of the Heisenberg exchange interaction from, e.g., ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic. We show that the pattern of the atomistic DMI in epitaxial magnetic structures can be very complex and provide critical insights into the nature of DMI. We anticipate that the observed effect is general and occurs in many magnetic nanostructures grown on heavy-element metallic substrates.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We report temperature-dependent spectroscopy on the layered (n=4) two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (BA)(MA)PbI. Helicity-resolved steady-state photoluminescence (PL) reveals no optical degree of polarization. Time-resolved PL shows a photocarrier lifetime on the order of nanoseconds. From simultaneaously recorded time-resolved differential reflectivity (TR$Œî$R) and time-resolved Kerr ellipticity (TRKE), a photocarrier lifetime of a few nanoseconds and a spin dephasing time on the order of picoseconds was found. This stark contrast in lifetimes clearly explains the lack of spin polarization in steady-state PL. While we observe clear temperature-dependent effects on the PL dynamics that can be related to structural dynamics, the spin dephasing is nearly T-independent. Our results highlight that spin dephasing in 2D (BA)(MA)PbI occurs at time scales faster than the exciton recombination time, which poses a bottleneck for applications aimingto utilize this degree of freedom.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>It is far well accepted that the morphology of nanoparticles and nanoalloys is of paramount importance to understand their properties. Furthemore, the morphology depends on the growth mechanism with coalescence generally accepted as one the most common mechanisms both in liquid and in the gas phase. Coalescence refers when two existing seeds collide and aggregate into a larger object. It is expected that the resulting aggregate shows a compact, often spherical structure, although strongly out of the equilibrium, referring to its global minimum. While the coalescence of liquid droplet is widely studied, the first stages of the coalescence between nanoseeds has attracted less interest, although important as multiple aggregation can take place. Here we simulate the coalescence of Au and Pd seeds by the Molecular Dynamics method, comparing the initial stage of the coalescence in vacuum and when there is an interacting surrounding around them. We show that the surface chemical composition of the resulting aggregate depend on the environment as well as the overall morphology.</p>

    <p>Quasicrystal (QC) has no periodicity but has a unique rotational symmetry forbidden in periodic crystals. Lack of microscopic theory of the crystalline electric field (CEF) in the QC and approximant crystal (AC) has prevented us from understanding the electric property, especially the magnetism. By developing the general formulation of the CEF in the rare-earth based QC and AC, we have analyzed the CEF in the QC Au-SM-Tb and AC (SM=Si, Ge, and Ga). The magnetic anisotropy arising from the CEF plays an important role in realizing unique magnetic states on the icosahedron (IC). By constructing the minimal model with the magnetic anisotropy, we have analyzed the ground-state properties of the IC, 1/1 AC, and QC. The hedgehog state is characterized by the topological charge of one and the whirling-moment state is characterized by the topological charge of three. The uniform arrangement of the ferrimagnetic state is stabilized in the QC with the ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, which is a candidate for the magnetic structure recently observed FM long-range order in the QC Au-Ga-Tb. The uniform arrangement of the hedgehog state is stabilized in the QC with the antiferromagnetic interaction, which suggests the possibility of the topological magnetic long-range order.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The development of many optical quantum technologies depends on the availability of solid-state single quantum emitters with near-perfect optical coherence. However, a standing issue that limits systematic improvement is the significant sample heterogeneity and lack of mechanistic understanding of microscopic energy flow at the single emitter level and ultrafast timescales. Here we develop solution-phase single-particle pump-probe spectroscopy with photon correlation detection that captures sample-averaged dynamics in single molecules and/or defect states with unprecedented clarity at femtosecond resolution. We apply this technique to single quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride, which suffers from significant heterogeneity and low quantum efficiency. From millisecond to nanosecond timescales, the translation diffusion, metastable-state-related bunching shoulders, rotational dynamics, and antibunching features are disentangled by their distinct photon-correlation timescales, which collectively quantify the normalized two-photon emission quantum yield. Leveraging its femtosecond resolution, spectral selectivity and ultralow noise (two orders of magnitude improvement over solid-state methods), we visualize electron-phonon coupling in the time domain at the single defect level, and discover the acceleration of polaronic formation driven by multi-electron excitation. Corroborated with results from a theoretical polaron model, we show how this translates to sample-averaged photon fidelity characterization of cascaded emission efficiency and optical decoherence time. Our work provides a framework for ultrafast spectroscopy in single emitters, molecules, or defects prone to photoluminescence intermittency and heterogeneity, opening new avenues of extreme-scale characterization and synthetic improvements for quantum information applications.</p>

    <p>Repeatable and reliable site-specific preparation of specimens for atom probe tomography (APT) at cryogenic temperatures has proven challenging. A generalized workflow is required for cryogenic-specimen preparation including lift-out via focused-ion beam and in-situ deposition of capping layers, to strengthen specimens that will be exposed to high electric field and stresses during field evaporation in APT, and protect them from environment during transfer into the atom probe. Here, we build on existing protocols, and showcase preparation and analysis of a variety of metals, oxides and supported frozen liquids and battery materials. We demonstrate reliable in-situ deposition of a metallic capping layer that significantly improve the atom probe data quality for challenging material systems, particularly battery cathode materials which are subjected to delithiation during the atom probe analysis itself. Our workflow designed is versatile and transferable widely to other instruments.</p>

    <p>The interplay between charge order (CO) and nontrivial band topology has spurred tremendous interest in understanding topological excitations beyond the single-particle description. In a quasi-one-dimensional nonsymmorphic crystal TaTe$_4$, the (2a$\times$2b$\times$3c) charge ordered ground state drives the system into a space group where the symmetry indicator features the emergence of Dirac fermions and unconventional double Dirac fermions. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we provide evidence of the CO induced Dirac fermion-related bands near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the band folding at the Fermi level is compatible with the new periodicity dictated by the CO, indicating that the electrons near the Fermi level follow the crystalline symmetries needed to host double Dirac fermions in this system.</p>

A damage driving force is defined based on the stored energy and dislocation density, relating phase-field fracture with microstructural fatigue damage. The formulation is numerically implemented using FFT methods to enable modelling of sufficiently large, representative 3D microstructural regions. The early stages of fatigue cracking are simulated, predicting crack paths, growth rates and sensitivity to relevant microstructural features. Crack propagation through crystallographic planes is shown in single crystals, while the analysis of polycrystalline solids reveals transgranular crack initiation and crystallographic crack growth.</p>

    <p>Bifurcations in kinetic pathways decide the evolution of a system. An example is crystallization, in which the thermodynamically stable polymorph may not form due to kinetic hindrance. Here, we use confined self-assembly to investigate the interplay of thermodynamics and kinetics in the crystallization pathways of finite clusters. We report the observation of decahedral clusters from colloidal particles in emulsion droplets and show that these decahedral clusters can be thermodynamically stable just like icosahedral clusters. Our hard sphere simulations reveal how the development of the early nucleus shape passes through a bifurcation that decides the cluster symmetry. A geometric argument explains why decahedral clusters are kinetically hindered and why icosahedral clusters can be dominant even if they are not the thermodynamic ground state.</p>

    <p>Spin-active quantum emitters have emerged as a leading platform for quantum technologies. However, one of their major limitations is the large spread in optical emission frequencies, which typically extends over tens of GHz. Here, we investigate single V4+ vanadium centres in 4H-SiC, which feature telecom-wavelength emission and a coherent S=1/2 spin state. We perform spectroscopy on single emitters and report the observation of spin-dependent optical transitions, a key requirement for spin-photon interfaces. By engineering the isotopic composition of the SiC matrix, we reduce the inhomogeneous spectral distribution of different emitters down to 100 MHz, significantly smaller than any other single quantum emitter. Additionally, we tailor the dopant concentration to stabilise the telecom-wavelength V4+ charge state, thereby extending its lifetime by at least two orders of magnitude. These results bolster the prospects for single V emitters in SiC as material nodes in scalable telecom quantum networks.</p>

    <p>We have performed an experimental and modeling-based study of the spin-orbit torque-induced growth of magnetic stripe domains in heavy metal/ferromagnet thin-film heterostructures that possess chiral N√©el-type domain walls due to an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In agreement with previous reports, the stripe domains stabilized in these systems exhibit a significant transverse growth velocity relative to the applied current axis. This behavior has previously been attributed to the Magnus force-like skyrmion Hall effect of the stripe domain spin topology, which is analogous to that of a half-skyrmion. However, through analytic modeling of the in-plane torques generated by spin-orbit torque, we find that a dynamical reconfiguration of the domain wall magnetization profile is expected to occur - promoting motion with similar directionality and symmetry as the skyrmion Hall effect. These results further highlight the sensitivity of spin-orbit torque to the local orientation of the domain wall magnetization profile and its contribution to domain growth directionality.</p>

    <p>Scattering problems are important in describing light propagation in wide ranging media such as the atmosphere, colloidal solutions, metamaterials, glass ceramic composites, transparent polycrystalline ceramics, and surfaces. The Rayleigh Gans Debye (RGD) approximation has enjoyed great success in describing a wide range of scattering phenomena. We derive a generalized RGD formulation from the perturbation of Maxwell equations. In contrast to most treatments of RGD scattering, our formulation can model any soft scattering phenomena in linear media, including scattering by stochastic process, lossy media, and by anisotropic inhomogeneities occurring at multiple length scales. Our first-principles derivation makes explicit underlying assumptions and provides jumping off points for more general treatments. The derivation also facilitates a deeper understanding of soft scattering. It is demonstrated that sources of scattering are not interfaces as is often presumed, but excess accelerating charges emitting uncompensated radiation. Approximations to the equations are also presented and discussed. For example, the scattering coefficient in the large size RGD limit is shown to be proportional to the correlation length and the variance of a projected phase shift.</p>

    <p>In twisted MoTe$_{2}$, latest transport measurement has reported observation of quantum anomalous Hall effect at hole filling $ŒΩ=-1$, which undergoes a topological phase transition to a trivial ferromagnet as layer hybridization gets suppressed by interlayer bias $D$. Here we show that this underlies the existence of an orbital Chern insulating state with gate ($D$) switchable sign in an antiferromagtic spin background at hole filling $ŒΩ=-2$. From momentum-space Hartree Fock calculations, we find this state has a topological phase diagram complementary to that of the $ŒΩ=-1$ one: by sweeping $D$ from negative to positive, the Chern number of this $ŒΩ=-2$ state can be switched between $+1$, $0$, and $-1$, accompanied by a sign change of a sizable orbital magnetization. In range of $D$ where this antiferronagnet is the ground state, the orbital magnetization allows magnetic field initialization of the spin antiferromagnetic order and the Chern number.</p>

    <p>The recent discovery of a charge density wave order at the wave vector $P$ $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ has created a mystery because subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show a dominant phonon instability instead at another wave vector $H$ $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$. In this paper, I use first principles total energy calculations to map out the landscape of the structural distortions due to the unstable phonon modes at $H$, $L$ $(\frac{1}{2},0,\frac{1}{2})$, and $P$ present in this material. In agreement with previous results, I find that the distortions due to the $H$ instability cause the largest gain in energy relative to the parent structure, followed in order by the $L$ and $P$ instabilities. However, only two distinct structure occur due to this instability, which are separated by 6 meV/f.u. The instability at $L$ results in three distinct structures separated in energy by 5 meV/f.u. In contrast, six different distorted structures are stabilized due to the instability at $P$, and they all lie within 2 meV/f.u.\ of each other. Hence, despite a lower energy gain, the condensation at $P$ could be favorable due to a larger entropy gain associated with the fluctuations within a manifold with larger multiplicity via the order-by-disorder mechanism.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The study of moir√© engineering started with the advent of van der Waals heterostructures in which stacking two-dimensional layers with different lattice constants leads to a moir√© pattern controlling their electronic properties. The field entered a new era when it was found that adjusting the twist between two graphene layers led to strongly-correlated-electron physics and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. Twist is now used routinely to adjust the properties of two-dimensional materials. Here, we investigate a new type of moir√© superlattice in bilayer graphene when one layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other - so-called biaxial heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling electronic states associated with a novel symmetry-breaking atomic reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer. Tight-binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir√© engineering in van der Waals multilayers.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In spinel-type nickelate NiRh$_2$O$_4$, magnetic ordering is observed upon the sample synthesized via kinetically controlled low-temperature solid-state metathesis, as opposed to previously-reported samples obtained through conventional solid-state reaction. Our findings are based on a combination of bulk susceptibility and specific heat measurements that disclose a N$√©$el transition temperature of $T_N$ = 45 K in this material, which might feature spin-orbit entanglement in the tetragonally-coordinated $d^8$ Mott insulators. The emergence of magnetic ordering upon alteration of the synthesis route indicates that the suppression of magnetic ordering in the previous sample was rooted in the cation-mixing assisted by the entropy gain that results from high-temperature reactions. Furthermore, the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 0 physics, instead of solely the spin-only $S = 1$, describes the observed enhancement of effective magnetic moment well. Overseeing all observations and speculations, we propose that the possible mechanism responsible for the emergent magnetic orderings in NiRh$_2$O$_4$ is the condensation of $J_{\rm eff}$ = 0 exciton, driven by the interplay of the tetragonal crystal field and superexchange interactions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Nanomechanical resonances of two-dimensional (2D) materials are sensitive probes for condensed-matter physics, offering new insights into magnetic and electronic phase transitions. Despite extensive research, the influence of the spin dynamics near a second-order phase transition on the nonlinear dynamics of 2D membranes has remained largely unexplored. Here, we investigate nonlinear magneto-mechanical coupling to antiferromagnetic order in suspended FePS$_3$-based heterostructure membranes. By monitoring the motion of these membranes as a function of temperature, we observe characteristic features in both nonlinear stiffness and damping close to the N√©el temperature $T_{\rm{N}}$. We account for these experimental observations with an analytical magnetostriction model in which these nonlinearities emerge from a coupling between mechanical and magnetic oscillations, demonstrating that magneto-elasticity can lead to nonlinear damping. Our findings thus provide insights into the thermodynamics and magneto-mechanical energy dissipation mechanisms in nanomechanical resonators due to the material's phase change and magnetic order relaxation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>MoS2 nanostructures are promising catalysts for proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to replace expensive noble metals. Their broadscale application demands high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as robust durability. Doping is commonly applied to enhance the HER activity of MoS2-based nanocatalysts, but the effect of dopants in the electrochemical and structural stability is yet to be discussed. Herein, we correlate operando electrochemical measurements to the structural evolution of the materials down to the nanometric scale by identical location electron microscopy and spectroscopy. The range of stable operation for MoS2 nanocatalysts with and without rhenium doping is experimentally defined. The responsible degradation mechanisms at first electrolyte contact, open circuit stabilization and HER conditions are experimentally identified and confirmed with the calculated Pourbaix diagram of Re-doped MoS2. Doping MoS2-based nanocatalysts is validated as a promising strategy for the continuous improvement of high performance and durable PEM electrolyzers.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The 5d pyrochlore oxide superconductor Cd2Re2O7 (CRO) has attracted significant interest as a spin-orbit-coupled metal (SOCM) that spontaneously undergoes a phase transition to an odd-parity multipole phase by breaking the spatial inversion symmetry due to the Fermi liquid instability caused by strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite the significance of structural information during the transition, previous experimental results regarding lattice deformation have been elusive. We have conducted ultra-high resolution synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction experiments on a high-quality CRO single crystal. The temperature-dependent splitting of the 0 0 16 and 0 0 14 reflections, which are allowed and forbidden, respectively, in the high-temperature cubic phase I (space group Fd-3m), has been clearly observed and reveals the following significant facts: inversion symmetry breaking and tetragonal distortion occur simultaneously at Ts1 = 201.5(1) K; the previously believed first-order transition between phase II (I-4m2) and phase III (I4122) at Ts2 ~ 120 K consists of two close second-order transitions at Ts2 = 115.4(1) K and Ts3 ~ 100 K; there is a new orthorhombic phase XI (F222) in between. The order parameters (OPs) of these continuous transitions are uniquely represented by a two-dimensional irreducible representation Eu of the Oh point group, and the OPs of phase XI are a linear combination of those of phases II and III. Each phase is believed to correspond to a distinct odd-parity multipole order, and the complex successive transitions observed may be the result of an electronic phase transition that resolves the Fermi liquid instability in the SOCM.</p>

    <p>The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</p>

    <p>The interplay between entropy transport and charge carriers-paramagnon interaction in the Onsager linear system has been a subject of debate due to the limited theoretical and experimental understanding of paramagnon heat capacity. In this study, we investigate this interplay in an anisotropic layered magnetic system using cluster mean-field theory with spin quantum correlations. By examining spin correlation functions between different spins with various types of clustering, we derive the spin correlation function as a function of distance and temperature for the inter-layer clusters both below and above the magnetic order phase transition. Our analysis reveals that paramagnons characterized by pronounced spin correlations among inter-layer nearest-neighbor spins exhibit a non-zero heat capacity, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of entropy transport. The findings align with experimental observations, lending strong support to the validity of the paramagnon drag thermopower concept. This study sheds light on the intricate dynamics and thermodynamic properties of paramagnons, advancing our understanding of entropy transport in complex systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is a spinel based on magnetic V$^{3+}$ ions which host both spin ($S=1$) and orbital ($l_{eff}=1$) moments. Owing to the underlying pyrochlore coordination of the magnetic sites, the spins in MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ only antiferromagnetically order once the frustrating interactions imposed by the $Fd\overline{3}m$ lattice are broken through an orbitally-driven structural distortion at T$_{S}$ $\simeq$ 60 K. Consequently, a N√©el transition occurs at T$_{N}$ $\simeq$ 40 K. Low temperature spatial ordering of the electronic orbitals is fundamental to both the structural and magnetic properties, however considerable discussion on whether it can be described by complex or real orbital ordering is ambiguous. We apply neutron spectroscopy to resolve the nature of the orbital ground state and characterize hysteretic spin-orbital correlations using x-ray and neutron diffraction. Neutron spectroscopy finds multiple excitation bands and we parameterize these in terms of a multi-level (or excitonic) theory based on the orbitally degenerate ground state. Meaningful for the orbital ground state, we report an "optical-like" mode at high energies that we attribute to a crystal-field-like excitation from the spin-orbital $j_{eff}$=2 ground state manifold to an excited $j_{eff}$=1 energy level. We parameterize the magnetic excitations in terms of a Hamiltonian with spin-orbit coupling and local crystalline electric field distortions resulting from deviations from perfect octahedra surrounding the V$^{3+}$ ions. We suggest that this provides compelling evidence for complex orbital order in MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. We then apply the consequences of this model to understand hysteretic effects in the magnetic diffuse scattering where we propose that MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ displays a high temperature orbital memory of the low temperature spin order.</p>

    <p>Solution-processed two-dimensional (2D) materials hold promise for their scalable applications. However, the random, fragmented nature of the solution-processed nanoflakes and the poor percolative conduction through their discrete networks limit the performance of the enabled devices. To overcome the problem, we report conduction modulation of the solution-processed 2D materials via the Stark effect. Using liquid-phase exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as an example, we demonstrate nonlinear conduction modulation with a switching ratio of >105 by the local fields from the interfacial ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE). Through density-functional theory calculations and in situ Raman scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopic analysis, we understand the modulation arises from a charge redistribution in the solution-processed MoS2. Beyond MoS2, we show the modulation may be viable for the other solution-processed 2D materials and low-dimensional materials. The effective modulation can open their electronic device applications.</p>

A significant single and sharp photoluminescence peak from a single moir√© exciton has been demonstrated after nano-fabrication. We present the longer duration of quantum coherence of a single moir√© exciton, which reaches beyond 10 ps and the accelerated decoherence process with elevating temperature and excitation power density. Moreover, the quantum interference has revealed the coupling between moir√© excitons in different moir√© potential minima.

    <p>Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a wide bandgap semiconductor material recently being used in replacement of traditional semiconductors for high-voltage power device applications. Radiation environments induce defects through displacement damage in the lattice that can saturate over periods of high energy particle exposure at various concentrations. Defects are characterized by the formation of vacancies, interstitials and Frenkel pairs. Using molecular dynamics software we calculate thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) over and specific heat capacity at constant volume ($c_v$) values over a temperature range varying defect concentrations in single crystal 4H-SiC. At a discovered critical defect density amorphous defect clusters form in the lattice triggering macroscopic negative thermal expansion across the entire temperature range. Exponential $c_v$ loss is observed as defect density increases until the isothermal process becomes completely adiabatic at a identified critical Frenkel pair concentration. Providing insight to the degradation of SiC from displacement damage effects can ultimately assist the development of radiation-hardened electronics.</p>

    <p>This letter presents a novel approach for identifying uncorrelated atomic configurations from extensive data sets with a non-standard neural network workflow known as random network distillation (RND) for training machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLPs). This method is coupled with a DFT workflow wherein initial data is generated with cheaper classical methods before only the minimal subset is passed to a more computationally expensive ab initio calculation. This benefits training not only by reducing the number of expensive DFT calculations required but also by providing a pathway to the use of more accurate quantum mechanical calculations for training. The method's efficacy is demonstrated by constructing machine-learned inter-atomic potentials for the molten salts KCl and NaCl. Our RND method allows accurate models to be fit on minimal data sets, as small as 32 configurations, reducing the required structures by at least one order of magnitude compared to alternative methods.</p>

By periodically driving a localized Majorana mode across the system, our protocol realizes a topological pumping of Majorana fermions, analogous to the adiabatic Thouless pumping of electrical charges. Importantly, similar to the realization of a Chern insulator through Thouless pumping, we show that pumping of Majorana zero modes could lead to a $p_x + ip_y$ superconductor in the two dimensions of space and synthetic time. The Floquet theory is employed to map the driven one-dimensional system to a two-dimensional synthetic system by considering frequency as a new dimension. We demonstrate such Floquet $p_x + i p_y$ superconductors using the Kitaev $p$-wave superconductor chain, a prototypical 1D topological system, as well as its more realistic realization in the 1D Kondo lattice model as examples. We further show the appearance of a new $œÄ$ Majorana mode at the Floquet zone boundary in an intermediate drive frequency region. Our work suggests a driven magnetic spiral coupled to a superconductor as a promising platform for the realization of novel topological superconductors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The formation of Frohlich polaron in metal halide perovskites, arising from the charge carrierlongitudinal optical (LO) phonon coupling, has been proposed to explain their exceptional properties, but the effective identification of polaron in these materials is still a challenge task. Herein, we theoretically present the infrared optical absorption of Frohlich polaron based on Huang-Rhys model. We find that multiphonon overtones are appeared as the energy of incident photon matches the multiple LO phonons, wherein the average phonon numbers of a polaron can be directly evaluated by the order of the strongest overtone. These multiphonon structures sensitively depend on the scale of electronic distribution in the ground state and the dimensionality of the perovskite materials, which gives the enlightenment for the effective modulation of competing processes between the polaron formation and carrier cooling. Moreover, the order of the strongest overtone shifts to the higher ones with temperature, providing a potential proof of the carriers mobility affected by LO phonons scattering. The present model not only suggests a direct way to verify Frohlich polaron, but also enriches the understanding of the polaron properties in metal halide perovskites.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The recently discovered layered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$(A=K, Rb, Cs) have attracted much attention because of their unique combination of superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW) order, and nontrivial band topology. The CDW order with an in-plane 2x2 reconstruction is found to exhibit exotic properties, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking and rotational symmetry breaking. However, the nature of the CDW, including its dimensionality, structural pattern, and effect on electronic structure, remains elusive despite intense research efforts. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we unveil for the first time characteristic double-band splittings and band reconstructions, as well as the band gap resulting from band folding, in the CDW phase. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we unambiguously show that the CDW in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from the intrinsic coexistence of Star-of-David and Tri-Hexagonal distortions. The alternating stacking of these two distortions naturally leads to three-dimensional 2x2x2 or 2x2x4 CDW order. Our results provide crucial insights into the nature and distortion pattern of the CDW order, thereby laying down the basis for a substantiated understanding of the exotic properties in the family of AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals.</p>

    <p>Silicon carbide has emerged as a promising material platform for quantum photonics and nonlinear optics. These properties make the development of integrated photonic components in high-quality silicon carbide a critical aspect for the advancement of scalable on-chip networks. In this work, we numerically design, fabricate and demonstrate the performance of monolithic metalenses from SiC suitable for on-chip optical operations. We engineer two distinct lenses, with parabolic and cubic phase profiles, operating in the near infrared spectral range, which is of interest for quantum and photonic applications. We support the lens fabrication by optical transmission measurement and characterize the focal points of the lenses. Our results will accelerate the development of SiC nanophotonic devices and aid in an on chip integration of quantum emitters with meta-optical components.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Quantum materials can display physical phenomena rooted in the geometry of electronic wavefunctions. The corresponding geometric tensor is characterized by an emergent field known as Berry curvature (BC). Large BCs typically arise when electronic states with different spin, orbital or sublattice quantum numbers hybridize at finite crystal momentum. In all materials known to date, the BC is triggered by the hybridization of a single type of quantum number. Here, we report the discovery of the first material system having both spin and orbital-sourced BC: LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces grown along the [111] direction. We detect independently these two sources and directly probe the BC associated to the spin quantum number through measurements of an anomalous planar Hall effect. The observation of a nonlinear Hall effect with time-reversal symmetry signals large orbital-mediated BC dipoles. The coexistence of different forms of BC enables the combination of spintronic and optoelectronic functionalities in a single material.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The curious occurrence of perfectly spherical particles when a steel substrate is slid against a hard abrasive was first observed and documented by Robert Hooke in the 17$^{th}$ century. Similar particles have subsequently been observed in numerous other abrasion-type processes, ranging from grinding of steels to sliding rock faults. The prevalent hypothesis, originally proposed by Hooke, is that these particles are formed due to high local temperatures between the abrasive and the substrate, resulting in melting, droplet ejection and subsequent resolidification -- the melting-resolidification hypothesis. In this work, we revisit this phenomenon using \emph{in situ} analysis of a model steel-abrasive contact geometry, complemented by analytical calculations. It is found that the temperature within the contact zone, for typical contact conditions used, is far from the melting point and that spherical particles do not form in the absence of oxygen. We thereby propose a modification of the melting-resolidification hypothesis, involving an intermediate exothermic oxidation stage, and provide quantitative evidence for each step of the process. Our results have implications for a wide class of abrasive systems that involve the formation and utilization of spherical metallic particles</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Controllable topological phase transitions are appealing as they allow for tunable single particle electronic properties. Here, by using state-of-the-art manybody perturbation theory techniques, we show that the topological $Z_2$ phase transition occurring in the single particle spectrum of the recently synthetized ethynylene bridged polyacene polymers is accompanied by a topological excitonic phase transition: the band inversion in the non-trivial phase yields real-space exciton wave functions in which electrons and holes exchange orbital characters with respect to the trivial phase. The topological excitonic phase transition results in a broad tunability of the singlet-triplet splittings, opening appealing perspectives for the occurrence of singlet fission. Finally, the flatness of the single-particle electronic structure in the topological non trivial phase leads to negatively dispersing triplet excitons in a large portion of the Brillouin zone, opening a route for spontaneously coherent energy transport at room temperature.</p>

    <p>We unravel the influence of quasiparticle screening in the non-equilibrium exciton dynamics of monolayer WS$_2$.

Based on a phenomenological model, we isolate the effective impact of excitons and free carriers on the renormalization of the quasi-free particle band gap, exciton binding energy and linewidth broadening. By this, our work does not only provide a comprehensive picture of the competing phenomena governing the exciton dynamics in WS$_2$ upon photoexcitation, but also demonstrates that exciton and carrier contributions to dynamic screening of the Coulomb interaction differ significantly.</p>

    <p>Monolayer C$_3$N is an emerging two-dimensional indirect band gap semiconductor with interesting mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties. In this work we present a description of C$_3$N electronic and dielectric properties, focusing on the so-called momentum-resolved exciton band structure. Excitation energies and oscillator strengths are computed in order to characterize bright and dark states, and discussed also with respect to the crystal symmetry. Activation of excitonic states is observed for finite transferred momenta: Indeed, we find an active indirect exciton at $\sim$ 0.9 eV, significantly lower than the direct optical gap of 1.96 eV, with excitonic binding energies in the range 0.6-0.9 eV for the lowest states. As for other 2D materials, we find a quasi-linear excitonic dispersion close to $Œì$, which however shows a downward convexity related to the indirect band gap of C$_3$N as well as to the dark nature of the involved excitons.</p>

Several diagnostic methods for aberration measurement and correction with maximum precision and accuracy have been proposed, albeit often at the cost of relatively long acquisition times. Here, we illustrate how artificial intelligence can be used to provide near-real-time diagnosis of aberrations from individual Ronchigrams. The demonstrated speed of aberration measurement is important as microscope conditions can change rapidly, as well as for the operation of MEMS-based hardware correction elements that have less intrinsic stability than conventional electromagnetic lenses.</p>

    <p>Spin-lattice dynamics is used to study the magnetic properties of Fe foams. The temperature dependence of the magnetization in foams is determined as a function of the fraction of surface atoms in foams, nsurf. The Curie temperature of foams decreases approximately linearly with nsurf, while the critical exponent of the magnetization increases considerably more strongly. If the data are plotted as a function of the fraction of surface atoms, reasonable agreement with recent data on vacancy-filled Fe crystals and novel data on void-filled crystals is observed for the critical . Critical temperature and critical exponent also depend on the coordination of surface atoms. Although the decrease we find is relatively small, it hints to the possibility of improved usage of topology to taylor magnetic properties.</p>

    <p>Near-bandgap photoemission spectroscopy experiments were performed on p-GaN and p-InGaN/GaN photocathodes activated to negative electron affinity. The photoemission quantum yield of the InGaN samples drops by more than one order of magnitude when the temperature is decreased while it remains constant on the GaN sample. This indicates a freezing of photoelectron transport in p-InGaN that we attribute to electron localization in the fluctuating potential induced by the alloy disorder. This interpretation is confirmed by the disappearence at low temperature of the peak in the photoemission spectrum that corresponds to the contribution of the photoelectrons relaxed at the bottom of the InGaN conduction band.</p>

    <p>Spin-charge interconversion is a very active direction in spintronics.

Here, on the basis of a 6-band $\boldsymbol{k.p}$ method combined with spin-resolved scattering theory, we give a theoretical demonstration of transverse spin-charge interconversion physics in STO Rashba interfaces. Calculations involve injection of spin current from a ferromagnetic contact by resonant tunneling into the native Rashba-split resonant levels of the STO triangular quantum well. We compute an asymmetric tunneling electronic transmission yielding a transverse charge current flowing in plane, with a dependence with gate voltage in a very good agreement with existing experimental data.</p>

    <p>Vanadium dioxide (VO2) as a phase-change material controls the transferred heat during phase transition process between metal and insulator states. At temperature above 68C, the rutile structure VO2 keeps the heat out and increases the IR radiation reflectivity, while at the lower temperature the monoclinic structure VO2 acts as the transparent material and increase the transmission radiation. In this paper, we first present the metal-insulator phase transition (MIT) of the VO2 in high and low temperatures. Then we simulate the meta-surface VO2 of metamaterial reflector by Ansys HFSS to show the emittance tunability of the rutile and monoclinic phase of the VO2. In next section, we will review the recent progress in the deposition of thermochromic VO2 on glass and silicon substrate with modifying the pressure of sputtering gases and temperature of the substrate. Finally, we present the results of the in-situ sputtered VOx thin film on thick SiO2 substrate in different combination of oxygen and argon environment by V2O5 target at temperature higher than 300C and then, analyze it with x-ray diffraction (XRD) method. The thermochromic VO2 based metamaterial structures open a new route to the passive energy-efficient optical solar reflector in the past few years.</p>

    <p>Graphene plasmons are able to become the fundermental of novel conceptual photonic devices, resulting from their unique characteristics containing excitation at room temperature and tunable spectral selectivity in different frequencies. The pursuit of efficiently exciting and manipulating graphene plasmons is necessary and significant for high-performance devices. Here, we investigate graphene plasmon wave propagating in ferroelectric nanocavity array. We experimentally show that the the periodic ferroelectric polarizations could be used for doping graphene into desired spatial carrier density patterns. Based on a theoretical model that considers periodic ununiform conductivity across graphene sheet, the simulation results show surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) in graphene can be excited by an incident light in a similar way to the excitation of photonic crystal resonant modes. The graphene SPP resonance can be tuned from ~720 to ~1 000 cm-1 by rescaling the ferroelectric nanocavity array, and from ~540 to ~780 cm-1 by dynamically changing the applied gate voltage. Our strategy of graphene carrier engineering to excite SPP offers a promissing way for large-scale, non-destructive fabrication of novel graphene photonic devices.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The radiative response of any object is governed by a surface parameter known as emissivity. Tuning the emissivity of surfaces has been of great interest in many applications involving thermal radiation such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal management systems, and passive radiative cooling. Although several surface engineering techniques (e.g., surface functionalization) have been pursued to alter the emissivity, there exists a knowledge gap in precisely predicting the emissivity of a surface prior to the modification/fabrication process. Predicting emissivity by a physics-based modeling approach is challenging due to surface's contributing factors, complex interactions and interdependence, and measuring the emissivity requires a tedious procedure for every sample. Thus, a new approach is much-needed to systematically predict the emissivity and expand the applications of thermal radiation. In this work, we demonstrate the immense advantage of employing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the emissivity of complex surfaces. For this aim, we fabricated 116 bulk aluminum 6061 samples with various surface characteristics using femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP). A comprehensive dataset was established by collecting surface characteristic data, laser operating parameters, and measured emissivities for all samples. We demonstrated the application of AI in two distinct scenarios. First, the range of emissivity of an unknown sample was shown to be estimated correctly solely based on its 3D surface morphology image. Second, the emissivity of a sample was precisely predicted based on its surface characteristics data and fabrication parameters. The implementation of the AI techniques resulted in the highly accurate prediction of emissivity by showing excellent agreement with the measurements.</p>

    <p>Metal nanoparticles have a substantial impact across different fields of science, such as photochemistry, energy conversion, and medicine. Among the commonly used nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles are of special interest due to their antibacterial properties and applications in sensing and catalysis. However, many of the methods used to synthesize silver nanoparticles often do not result in well-defined products, the main obstacles being high polydispersity or a lack of particle size tunability. We describe an automated approach to on-demand synthesis of adjustable particles with mean radii of 3 and 5 nm using the polyol route. The polyol process is a promising route for silver nanoparticles e.g., to be used as reference materials. We characterised the as-synthesized nanoparticles using small-angle X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering and further methods, showing that automated synthesis can yield colloids with reproducible and tuneable properties.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Characterizing meltpool shape and geometry is essential in metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) to control the printing process and avoid defects. Predicting meltpool flaws based on process parameters and powder material is difficult due to the complex nature of MAM process. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be useful in connecting process parameters to the type of flaws in the meltpool. In this work, we introduced a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML for melt pool characterization. An extensive experimental dataset has been collected from more than 80 MAM articles containing MAM processing conditions, materials, meltpool dimensions, meltpool modes and flaw types. We introduced physics-aware MAM featurization, versatile ML models, and evaluation metrics to create a comprehensive learning framework for meltpool defect and geometry prediction. This benchmark can serve as a basis for melt pool control and process optimization. In addition, data-driven explicit models have been identified to estimate meltpool geometry from process parameters and material properties which outperform Rosenthal estimation for meltpool geometry while maintaining interpretability.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Little is known about the role of weak interlayer coupling in the second harmonic generation (SHG) effects of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) systems. In this article, taking homo-bilayer $MoS_2/MoS_2$ and hetero-bilayer $MoS_2/MoSe_2$ as typical examples, we have systemically investigated their SHG susceptibilities as a function of interlayer hopping strength using first-principles calculations. For the SHG at zero frequency limit of both $MoS_2/MoS_2$ and $MoS_2/MoSe_2$, although the increase of tint can increase the intensities of interlayer optical transitions (IOT), the increased band repulsion around G point can eventually decrease their SHG values; the larger the tint, the smaller the SHG response. For the SHG spectra of $MoS_2/MoSe_2$ in the low photon-energy region, opposite to the $MoS_2/MoS_2$, their peak values are very sensitive to the variable tint, due to the strong $t_{int}$-dependent IOT dominating in the band edge; the larger the tint, the larger the SHG. For the SHG of $MoS_2/MoS_2$ in the high photon-energy region, comparing to the $MoS_2/MoSe_2$, their peak values will decrease in a much more noticeable way as the $t_{int}$ increases, due to the larger reduction of band nesting effect. Our study not only can successfully explain the puzzling experimental observations for the different SHG responses in different bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides under variable tint, but also may provide a general understanding for designing controllable the SHG effects in the vdW systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The presence of electrostatic forces and associated artifacts complicates the interpretation of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM). Eliminating these artifacts provides an opportunity for precisely mapping domain wall structures and dynamics, accurately quantifying local piezoelectric coupling coefficients, and reliably investigating hysteretic processes at the single nanometer scale to determine properties and mechanisms which underly important applications including computing, batteries and biology. Here we exploit the existence of an electrostatic blind spot (ESBS) along the length of the cantilever, due to the distributed nature of the electrostatic force, which can be universally used to separate unwanted long range electrostatic contributions from short range electromechanical responses of interest. The results of ESBS-PFM are compared to state-of-the-art interferometric displacement sensing PFM, showing excellent agreement above their respective noise floors. Ultimately, ESBS-PFM allows for absolute quantification of piezoelectric coupling coefficients independent of probe, lab or experimental conditions. As such, we expect the widespread adoption of EBSB-PFM to be a paradigm shift in the quantification of nanoscale electromechanics.</p>

    <p>Harmonic analysis is a powerful tool to characterize and quantify current-induced torques acting on magnetic materials, but so far it remains an open question in studying antiferromagnets. Here we formulate a general theory of harmonic Hall responses of collinear antiferromagnets driven by current-induced torques including both field-like and damping-like components. By scanning a magnetic field of variable strength in three orthogonal planes, we are able to distinguish the contributions from field-like torque, damping-like torque, and concomitant thermal effects by analyzing the second harmonic signals in the Hall voltage. The analytical expressions of the first and second harmonics as functions of the magnetic field direction and strength are confirmed by numerical simulations with good agreement. We demonstrate our predictions in two prototype antiferromagnets, $Œ±-$Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and NiO, providing direct and general guidance to current and future experiments.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Clapping modes, which are relative amplitude and phase modes between two chiral components of Cooper pairs, are bosonic collective modes inherent to chiral superconductors. These modes behave as long-lived bosons with masses smaller than the threshold energy, $2|Œî|$, for decay into unbound fermion pairs. Here, we clarify that the real/imaginary clapping modes in chiral superconductors directly couple to acoustic wave propagation when the weak particle-hole asymmetry of the normal state quasiparticle dispersion is taken into account. The clapping modes driven by an acoustic wave generate an alternating electric current, that is, the acoustoelectric effect in superconductors. Significantly, the clapping modes give rise to a transverse electric current. When the sound velocity is comparable to the Fermi velocity, as in heavy fermion compounds, the transverse current is resonantly enhanced at energy below the threshold for continuum excitations. This resonance provides a smoking-gun evidence of chiral superconductivity.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The heavy-fermion system $\mathrm{UTe_2}$ is a candidate for spin-triplet superconductivity, which is of considerable interest to quantum engineering. Among the outstanding issues is the nature of the pairing state. A recent surprising discovery is the observation of a resonance in the spin excitation spectrum at an antiferromagnetic wavevector [C. Duan {\it et al.}, Nature \textbf{600}, 636 (2021)], which stands in apparent contrast to the ferromagnetic nature of the interactions expected in this system. We show how the puzzle can be resolved by a multiorbital spin-triplet pairing constructed from local degrees of freedom. Because it does not commute with the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian, the pairing contains both intra- and inter-band terms in the band basis. We demonstrate that the intraband pairing component naturally yields a spin resonance at the antiferromagnetic wavevector. Our work illustrates how orbital degrees of freedom can enrich the nature and properties of spin-triplet superconductivity of strongly-correlated quantum materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Magnetic resonances driven by current-induced torques are crucial tools to study magnetic materials but are very limited in frequency and mechanical efficiency. We propose an alternative mechanism, voltage-induced torque, to realize high efficiency in generating high-frequency magnetization dynamics. When a ferromagnet-topological insulator-ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure is operated as an adiabatic quantum motor, voltage-induced torque arises from the adiabatic motion of gapped topological electrons on the two interfaces and act oppositely on the two ferromagnetic layers, which can excite the exchange mode where the two ferromagnetic layers precess with a $œÄ$-phase difference. The exchange mode resonance, bearing a much higher frequency than the ferromagnetic resonance, is accompanied by topological charge pumping, leading to a sharp peak in electrical admittance at the resonance point. Because the output current is purely adiabatic while dissipative current vanishes identically, the proposed voltage-driven exchange resonance entails a remarkably high mechanical efficiency close to unity, which is impossible in any current-driven systems.</p>

    <p>Pd$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ has been proposed to be topologically non-trivial in nature. However, evidence of its non-trivial behavior is still unexplored. We report the growth and magneto-transport study of Pd$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ thin films, revealing for the first time the contribution of two-dimensional (2D) topological surface states. We observe exceptional non-saturated linear magnetoresistance which results from Dirac fermions inhabiting the lowest Landau level in the quantum limit. The transverse magnetoresistance changes from a semi-classical weak-field $B^{2}$ dependence to a high-field $B$ dependence at a critical field $B^{\star}$. It is found that $B^{\star} \propto T^2$, which is expected from the Landau level splitting of a linear energy dispersion. In addition, the magnetoconductivity shows signatures of 2D weak anti-localization (WAL). These novel magnetotransport signatures evince the presence of 2D Dirac fermions in Pd$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ thin films.</p>

    <p>The structural, electronic, lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and superconducting properties of the alkali-metal hydride RbH, metalized through electron-doping by the construction of the solid-solution Rb$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$H, are systematically analyzed as a function of Sr-content within the framework of density functional perturbation and Migdal-Eliashberg theories, taking into account the effect of zero-point energy contribution by the quasi-harmonic approximation. For the entire studied range of Sr-content, steady increments of the electron-phonon coupling constant and the superconducting critical temperature are found with progressive alkaline-earth metal content through electron-doping, reaching the values of $Œª=1.92$ and $T_c=51.3(66.1)$~K with $Œº^*$=0.1(0). The steady rise of such quantities as a function of Sr-content is consequence of the metallization of the hydride as an increase of density of states at the Fermi level is observed, as well as the softening of the phonon spectrum, mainly coming from H-optical modes. Our results indicate that electron-doping on metal-hydrides is an encouraging alternative to look for superconductivity without applied pressure.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We investigate the dynamics of an injection locked in-plane uniform spin torque oscillator for several forcing configurations at large driving amplitudes. For the analysis, the spin wave amplitude equation is used to reduce the dynamics to a general oscillator equation in which the forcing is a complex valued function $F(p,œà)\proptoŒµ_1 (p)cos(œà)+iŒµ_2 (p)sin(œà)$. Assuming that the oscillator is strongly nonisochronous and/or forced by a power forcing $(|ŒΩŒµ_1/Œµ_2 |\gg 1)$, we show that the parameters $Œµ_{1,2} (p)$ govern the main bifurcation features of the Arnold tongue diagram : (i) the locking range asymmetry is mainly controlled by $dŒµ_1 (p)/dp$, (ii) the Taken-Bogdanov bifurcation occurs for a power threshold depending on $Œµ_{1,2} (p)$ and (iii) the frequency hysteretic range is related to the transient regime through the resonant frequency at zero mismatch frequency. Then, the model is compared with the macrospin simulation for driving amplitudes as large as $10^0-10^3 A/m$ for the magnetic field and $10^{10}-10^{12} A/m^2$ for the current density. As predicted by the model, the forcing configuration (nature of the driving signal, applied direction, the harmonic orders) affects substantially the oscillator dynamic. However, some discrepancies are observed. In particular, the prediction of the frequency and power locking range boundaries may be misestimated if the hysteretic boundaries are of same magnitude order. Moreover, the misestimation can be of two different types according if the bifurcation is Saddle node or Taken Bogdanov. These effects are a further manifestation of the complexity of the dynamics in nonisochronous auto-oscillators.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) technique for measurements on the micron scale. Spectral acquisition speeds of many orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art modulation spectroscopy setups are demonstrated. The experimental method is based on charge-coupled-device detection, avoiding speed-limiting components, such as polarization modulators with lock-in amplifiers. At the same time, FRS spectra are obtained with a sensitivity of 20 $Œº$rad (0.001$^\circ$) over a broad spectral range (525 nm - 800 nm), which is on par with state-of-the-art polarization-modulation techniques. The new measurement technique also automatically cancels unwanted Faraday rotation backgrounds. Using the setup, we perform Faraday rotation spectroscopy of excitons in a hBN-encapsulated atomically thin semiconductor WS$_2$ under magnetic fields of up to 1.4 T at room temperature and liquid helium temperature. We determine the A exciton g-factor of -4.4 $\pm$ 0.3 at room temperature, and -4.2 $\pm$ 0.2 at liquid helium temperature. In addition, we perform FRS and hysteresis loop measurements on a 20 nm thick film of an amorphous magnetic Tb$_{0.2}$Fe$_{0.8}$ alloy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A charge order (CO) with a wavevector $\mathbf{q}\simeq\left(\frac{1}{3},0,0\right)$ is observed in infinite-layer nickelates. Here we use first-principles calculations to demonstrate a charge-transfer-driven CO mechanism in infinite-layer nickelates, which leads to a characteristic Ni$^{1+}$-Ni$^{2+}$-Ni$^{1+}$ stripe state. For every three Ni atoms, due to the presence of near-Fermi-level conduction bands, Hubbard interaction on Ni-$d$ orbitals transfers electrons on one Ni atom to conduction bands and leaves electrons on the other two Ni atoms to become more localized. We further derive a low-energy effective model to elucidate that the CO state arises from a delicate competition between Hubbard interaction on Ni-$d$ orbitals and charge transfer energy between Ni-$d$ orbitals and conduction bands. With physically reasonable parameters, $\mathbf{q}=\left(\frac{1}{3},0,0\right)$ CO state is more stable than uniform paramagnetic state and usual checkerboard antiferromagnetic state. Our work highlights the multi-band nature of infinite-layer nickelates, which leads to some distinctive correlated properties that are not found in cuprates.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Candidate materials for Kitaev spin liquid phase have been intensively studied recently because of their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. Although most of the studies on Kitaev spin liquid have been done in 4$d$ and 5$d$ based transition metal compounds, recently there has been a growing research interest in Co-based quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnets, such as BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ because of formation of spin-orbit-entangled $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 pseudospin moments at Co$^{2+}$ sites and potential realizations of Kitaev-like magnetism therein. Here, we obtain high-accuracy crystal and electronic structure of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ by employing a combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which correctly capture the Mott-insulating nature of the target system. We show that Co$^{2+}$ ions form a high spin configuration, $S=3/2$, with an active $L_{\rm eff}=1$ orbital degree of freedom, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The size of trigonal distortion within CoO$_6$ octahedra is found to be not strong enough to completely quench the orbital degree of freedom, so that the presence of spin-orbit coupling can give rise to the formation of spin-orbit-entangled moments and the Kitaev exchange interaction. Our finding supports recent studies on potential Kitaev magnetism in this compound and other Co-based layered honeycomb systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work, a novel highly fabrication tolerant polarization beam splitter (PBS) is presented on an InP platform. To achieve the splitting, we combine the Pockels effect and the plasma dispersion effect in a symmetric 1x2 Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). One p-i-n phase shifter of the MZI is driven in forward bias to exploit the plasma dispersion effect and modify the phase of both the TE and TM mode. The other arm of the MZI is driven in reverse bias to exploit the Pockels effect which affects only the TE mode. By adjusting the voltages of the two phase shifters, a different interference condition can be set for the TE and the TM modes thereby splitting them at the output of the MZI. By adjusting the voltages, the very tight fabrication tolerances known for fully passive PBS are eased. The experimental results show that an extinction ratio better than 15 dB and an on-chip loss of 3.5 dB over the full C-band (1530-1565nm) are achieved.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Although much effort has been made to explore quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in both theory and experiment, the QAHE systems with tunable Chern numbers are yet limited. Here, we theoretically propose that NiAsO$_3$ and PdSbO$_3$, monolayer transitional metal oxides, can realize QAHE with tunable Chern numbers via manipulating their magnetization orientations. When the magnetization lies in the \textit{x-y} plane and all mirror symmetries are broken, the low-Chern-number (i.e., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$) phase emerges. When the magnetization exhibits non-zero \textit{z}-direction component, the system enters the high-Chern-number (i.e., $\mathcal{C}=\pm3$) phase, even in the presence of canted magnetization. The global band gap can approach the room-temperature energy scale in monolayer PdSbO$_3$ (23.4 meV), when the magnetization is aligned to \textit{z}-direction. By using Wannier-based tight-binding model, we establish the phase diagram of magnetization induced topological phase transition. Our work provides a high-temperature QAHE system with tunable Chern number for the practical electronic application.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been thoroughly investigated due to their formally divergent Q-factor, especially those emerging in all-dielectric, nanostructured metasurfaces from symmetry protection at the $Œì$ point (in-plane wavevector $k_{||}=0$). Less attention has been paid to accidental BICs that may appear at any other $k_{||}\not =0$ in the band structure of supported modes, being in turn difficult to predict. Here we make use of a coupled electric/magnetic dipole model to determine analytical conditions for the emergence of accidental BICs, valid for any planar array of meta-atoms that can be described by dipolar resonances, which is the case of many nanostructures in the optical domain. This is explored for all-dielectric nanospheres through explicit analytical conditions that allow us in turn to predict accidental BIC positions in the parameter space $(œâ,\bf{k_{||}}$). Finally, such conditions are exploited to determine not only single, but also double (for both linear polarizations) accidental BICs occurring at the same position in the dispersion relation $œâ-\bf{k_{||}}$ for realistic semiconductor nanodisk meta-atoms. This might pave the way to a variety of BIC-enhanced light-matter interaction phenomena at the nanoscale such as lasing or non-linear conversion, that benefit from emerging at wavevectors away from the $Œì$ point (off-normal incidence) overlapping for both linear polarizations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We use the method of field decomposition, a technique widely used in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, to study the small velocity approximation (SVA) of the Lorentz transformation in Maxwell equations for slowly moving media. The "deformed" Maxwell equations derived under the SVA in the lab frame can be put into the conventional form of Maxwell equations in the medium's comoving frame. Our results show that the Lorentz transformation in the SVA up to $O(v/c)$ ($v$ is the speed of the medium and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum) is essential to derive these equations: the time and charge density must also change when transforming to a different frame even in the SVA, not just the position and current density as in the Galilean transformation. This marks the essential difference of the Lorentz transformation from the Galilean one. We show that the integral forms of Faraday and Ampere equations for slowly moving surfaces are consistent with Maxwell equations. We also present Faraday equation the covariant integral form in which the electromotive force can be defined as a Lorentz scalar independent of the observer's frame. No evidences exist to support an extension or modification of Maxwell equations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Colloidal dispersions are prized as model systems to understand basic properties of materials, and are central to a wide range of industries from cosmetics to foods to agrichemicals. Among the key developments in using colloids to address challenges in condensed matter is to resolve the particle coordinates in 3D, allowing a level of analysis usually only possible in computer simulation. However in amorphous materials, relating mechanical properties to microscopic structure remains problematic. This makes it rather hard to understand, for example, mechanical failure. Here we address this challenge by studying the contacts and the forces between particles, as well as their positions. To do so, we use a colloidal model system (an emulsion) in which the interparticle forces and local stress can be linked to the microscopic structure. We demonstrate the potential of our method to reveal insights into the failure mechanisms of soft amorphous solids by determining local stress in a colloidal gel. In particular, we identify `force chains' of load-bearing droplets, and local stress anisotropy, and investigate their connection with locally rigid packings of the droplets.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>An effective numerical method is presented for optimizing model parameters that can be applied to any type of system of non-linear equations and any number of data-points, which does not require explicit formulation of the objective function or its partial derivatives. The numerics are reduced to solving a non-linear least squares problem, which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the Jacobian is approximated by applying rank-one updates using Broyden's method. An advantage of this methodology over conventional approaches is that the partial derivatives of the objective function do not have to be analytically calculated. For instance, there may be situations where one cannot formulate the partial derivatives, such as cases involving an objective function that itself contains a nested optimization problem. Moreover, a line search algorithm is also described that ensures that the Armijo conditions are satisfied and that convergence is assured, which makes the success of the approach insensitive to the initial estimates of the model parameters. The foregoing numerical methods are described with respect to the development of the Optima software to solve inverse problems, which are reduced to non-linear least squares problems. This computational approach has proven to be particularly useful at solving inverse problems of very complex physical models that cannot be optimized directly in a practical way.</p>

    <p>The monolithic integration of extended short-wave infrared (e-SWIR) photodetectors (PDs) on silicon is highly sought-after to implement manufacturable, cost-effective sensing and imaging technologies. With this perspective, GeSn PIN PDs have been the subject of extensive investigations because of their bandgap tunability and silicon compatibility. However, due to growth defects, these PDs suffer a relatively high dark current density as compared to commercial III-V PDs. Herein, we elucidate the mechanisms governing the dark current in $2.6 \, Œº$m GeSn PDs at a Sn content of $10$ at.%. It was found that in the temperature range of $293 \, $K -- $363 \,$K and at low bias, the diffusion and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) leakage mechanisms dominate the dark current in small diameter ($20 \, Œº$m) devices, while combined SRH and trap assisted tunneling (TAT) leakage mechanisms are prominent in larger diameter ($160 \, Œº$m) devices. However, at high reverse bias, TAT leakage mechanism becomes dominant regardless of the operating temperature and device size. The effective non-radiative carrier lifetime in these devices was found to reach $\sim 300$ -- $400$ ps at low bias. Owing to TAT leakage current, however, this lifetime reduces progressively as the bias increases.</p>

    <p>When the particle size of a metal is reduced, it is expected that an energy gap will open due to the quantum size effect. However, the energy gap in platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles has not been observed directly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). To investigate the particle size dependence of the electronic state of Pt nanoparticles, we performed 195Pt NMR experiments on thiol-capped Pt nanoparticles with three different average diameters of less than 3 nm. For the nanoparticles with a diameter of 2.8 nm, we observed usual metallic behavior with a smaller density of states than that of the bulk Pt. In contrast, the temperature dependence of 1/T1T in nanoparticles less than 2.5 nm in diameter is an activation-energy form above 150 K, which is semiconducting behavior with an energy gap of the order of 2000 K. The significant decrease in 1/T1T by more than two orders of magnitude in the smaller Pt nanoparticles compared to the bulk Pt is attributable to the disappearance of the density of states at the Fermi energy, which is consistent with the opening of an energy gap. These results indicate a metal-insulator transition below 2.5 nm in diameter is present in our thiol-capped Pt nanoparticle samples. The effect of the thiol capping on the electronic structure suggested by the experimental results is also discussed.</p>

    <p>Due to the small photon momentum, optical spectroscopy commonly probes magnetic excitations only at the center of the Brillouin zone; however, there are ways to override this restriction. In the case of the distorted kagome quantum magnet Y-kapellasite, Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_8$, under scrutiny here, the magnon density of states can be accessed over the entire Brillouin zone through three-center magnon excitations. This mechanism is aided by the three different magnetic sublattices and strong short-range correlations in the distorted kagome lattice. The results of THz time-domain experiments agree remarkably well with linear spin-wave theory. Relaxing the conventional zone-center constraint of photons gives a new aspect to probe magnetism in matter.</p>

    <p>Spectral/angular emissivity $e$ and absorptivity $Œ±$ of an object are widely believed to be identical by Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation in reciprocal systems, but this introduces an intrinsic and inevitable energy loss for energy conversion and harvesting devices. So far, experimental evidences of breaking this well-known balance are still absent, and previous theoretical proposals are restricted to narrow single-band nonreciprocal radiation. Here we observe for the first time, to our knowledge, the violation of Kirchhoff's law using ultrathin ($<Œª/40$, $Œª$ is the working wavelength) magnetized InAs semiconductor films at epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) frequencies. Large difference of $|Œ±-e|>0.6$ has been experimentally demonstrated under a moderate external magnetic field. Moreover, based on magnetized ENZ building blocks supporting asymmetrically radiative Berreman and surface ENZ modes, we show versatile shaping of nonreciprocal thermal radiation: single-band, dual-band, and broadband nonreciprocal emission spectra at different wavebands. Our findings of breaking Kirchhoff's law will advance the conventional understanding of emission and absorption processes of natural objects, and lay a solid foundation for more comprehensive studies in designing various nonreciprocal thermal emitters. The reported recipe of diversely shaping nonreciprocal emission will also breed new possibilities in renovating next-generation nonreciprocal energy devices in the areas of solar cells, thermophotovoltaic, radiative cooling, etc.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The intersections of topology, geometry and strong correlations offer many opportunities for exotic quantum phases to emerge in condensed matter systems. Weyl fermions, in particular, provide an ideal platform for exploring the dynamical instabilities of single-particle physics under interactions. Despite its fundamental role in relativistic field theory, the concept of causality and the associated spacetime light cone and event horizon has not been considered in connection with interacting Weyl fermionic excitations in quantum matter. Here, by using charge-density wave (CDW) as an example, we unveil the behavior of interacting Weyl fermions and show that a Weyl fermion in a system can open a band gap by interacting only with other Weyl fermions that lie within its energy-momentum dispersion cone. In this sense, causal connections or interactions are only possible within overlapping dispersion cones and each dispersion cone thus constitutes a solid-state analogue of the more conventional `event horizon' of high-energy physics. Our study provides a universal framework for considering interacting relativistic quasiparticles in condensed matter by separating them into energy-like and momentum-like relationships in analogy with the time-like and space-like events in high-energy physics. Finally, we consider two different candidate materials for hosting the Weyl CDW phase: (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. Our study greatly enriches the phenomenology and unveils new connections between condensed matter and high-energy physics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Defects in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) greatly influence their optoelectronic properties. Identification and better understanding of defects existing in OIHPs is an essential step towards fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells. However, direct visualizing the defects is still a challenge for OIHPs due to their sensitivity during electron microscopy characterizations. Here, by using low dose scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques, we observe the common existence of antiphase boundary (APB) in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPbI$_3$), resolve its atomic structure, and correlate it to the electrical/ionic activities and structural instabilities. Such an APB is caused by the half-unit-cell shift of [PbI$_6$]$_4$-octahedron along the [100]/[010] direction, leading to the transformation from corner-sharing [PbI$_6$]$_4$-octahedron in bulk MAPbI$_3$ into edge-sharing ones at the APB. Based on the identified atomic-scale configuration, we further carry out density functional theory calculations and reveal that the APB in MAPbI$_3$ repels both electrons and holes while serves as a fast ion-migration channel, causing a rapid decomposition into PbI$_2$ that is detrimental to optoelectronic performance. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between structures and optoelectronic properties of OIHPs and suggest that controlling the APB is essential for their stability.</p>

    <p>Magnetic vortex is topologically nontrivial and commonly found in ferromagnetic nanodisks. So far, three classes spin-wave eigenmodes, i.e., gyrotropic, azimuthal and radial modes, have been identified in ferromagnetic nanodisks. Here, using micromagnetic simulation and analytical calculation, we reveal twisted spin-wave modes in a thick permalloy (Ni0.8Fe0.2) nanodisk. The twisted spin-waves carry topological charges, which sign depends on the core polarity of the magnetic vortex in the nanodisk. By applying rotating magnetic fields at one end of the sample, we observe continuous generation of twisted spin-waves that have characteristic spiral phase front and carry topological charge l = 1, -1, 2 and -2. The dispersion relation of twisted spin-waves is derived analytically and the result is in good agreement with micromagnetic numerical calculations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Industrial use of ultrashort-pulse surface structuring would significantly increase by an effective utilization of the average laser powers available currently. However, the unexplained degradation of surfaces processed with numerous pulses at high average laser power makes this difficult. Based on a systematic experimental study, the structure formation underlying such surface degradation was investigated. We presented a hierarchical structural formation model that bridges the gap between laser-induced periodic surface structures and surface degradation. Contrary to expectations based on previous research, we observed less structure formation on titanium for high laser fluences. As a possible reason, enhanced electron diffusion with increasing intensity was investigated within the framework of the two-temperature model. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms involved in surface structuring with ultrashort pulses.</p>

    <p>Micromagnetic small-angle neutron scattering theory is well established for analyzing spin-misalignment scattering data of bulk ferromagnets. Here, this theory is extended to allow for a global uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (texture) of the material, in addition to the already included random zero-average local anisotropy. Macroscopic cross-sections and spin-misalignment response functions are computed analytically for several practically relevant mutual anisotropy and external magnetic field orientations in both parallel and perpendicular scattering geometries for field magnitudes both above and below the rotational saturation. Some of these expressions are tested on published experimental data of magnetic-field-annealed Vitroperm and plastically-deformed Ni, allowing to determine the corresponding global uniaxial anisotropy quality factors.</p>

The glass-forming ability and glass stability of prepared glass was estimated by Hruby parameter using Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Thermo-gravimetric Analysis (TGA). The study of FTIR spectra and X-ray diffraction described the ionic nature and the amorphous pattern of glass respectively. The absorption peaks were observed for the transitions 6H5/2-4P3/2 at 402 nm,6H5/2-4M19/2 at 418 nm, 6H5/2-4I15/2 at 462 nm and 6H5/2-4I11/2 at 478 nm in the absorption spectra. The optical band gap energy (Eg) was calculated and observed to be decreased from 2.95 eV to 1.50 eV with doping concentration. The visible emission band was observed in the Sm3+ doped glass samples. The variation of dielectric constant with frequency was found to be independent for the frequency range 3 kHz - 2 MHz. The measurement of temperature-dependent dc conductivity showed Arrhenius type mechanism of conduction.</p>

    <p>Recent reports of superconductivity at KTaO3 (KTO) (110) and (111) interfaces have sparked intense interest due to the relatively high critical temperature as well as other properties that distinguish this system from the more extensively studied SrTiO3 (STO)-based heterostructures. Here we report nanoscale control of the metal-to-insulator transition at the LaAlO3/KTO (110) and (111) interfaces. Devices are created using two distinct methods previously developed for STO-based heterostructures: (1) conductive atomic-force microscopy lithography and (2) ultra-low-voltage electron-beam lithography. At low temperatures, KTO-based devices show superconductivity that is tunable by an applied back gate. A nanowire device shows single-electron-transistor (SET) behavior. These reconfigurable methods of creating nanoscale devices in KTO-based heterostructures offer new avenues for investigating mechanisms of superconductivity as well as development of quantum devices that incorporate strong spin-orbit interactions, superconducting behavior, and nanoscale dimensions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) models, defined on $D$-dimensional simple cubic lattice, are paradigmatic toy models for studying $D$-th order topology and corner-localized, mid-gap states. Under periodic boundary conditions, the Wilson loops of non-Abelian Berry connection of BBH models along all high-symmetry axes have been argued to exhibit gapped spectra, which predict gapped surface-states under open boundary conditions. In this work, we identify 1D, 2D, and 3D topological invariants for characterizing higher order topological insulators. Further, we demonstrate the existence of cubic-symmetry-protected, gapless spectra of Wilson loops and surface-states along the body diagonal directions of the Brillouin zone of BBH models. We show the gapless surface-states are described by $2^{D-1}$-component, massless Dirac fermions. Thus, BBH models can exhibit the signatures of first and $D$-th order topological insulators, depending on the details of externally imposed boundary conditions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Many metallic transition-metal oxides turn insulating when grown as films that are only a few unit-cells thick. The microscopic origins of these thickness induced metal-to-insulator transitions however remain under dispute. Here, we simulate the extreme case of a monolayer of an inconspicuous correlated metal -- the strontium vanadate SrVO$_3$ -- deposited on a SrTiO$_3$ substrate. Crucially, our system can have a termination to vacuum consisting of either a SrO or a VO$_2$ top layer. While we find that both lead to Mott insulating behavior at nominal stoichiometry, the phase diagram emerging upon doping -- chemically or through an applied gate voltage -- is qualitatively different. Indeed, our many-body calculations reveal a cornucopia of nonlocal fluctuations associated with (in)commensurate antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, as well as stripe and checkerboard orbital ordering instabilities. Identifying that the two geometries yield crystal-field splittings of opposite signs, we elucidate the ensuing phases through the lens of the orbital degrees of freedom. Quite generally, our work highlights that interface and surface reconstruction and the deformation or severing of coordination polyhedra in ultra-thin films drive rich properties that are radically different from the material's bulk physics.</p>

    <p>Here, we report first principles calculations and analysis of laser-induced photocurrents at the surface of a prototype Rashba system. By referring to Keldysh non-equilibrium formalism combined with the Wannier interpolation scheme we perform first-principles electronic structure calculations of a prototype BiAg$_2$ surface alloy, which is a well-known material realization of the Rashba model. In addition to non-magnetic ground state situation we also study the case of in-plane magnetized BiAg$_2$. We calculate the laser-induced charge photocurrents for the ferromagnetic case and the laser-induced spin photocurrents for both the non-magnetic and the ferromagnetic cases. Our results confirm the emergence of very large in-plane photocurrents as predicted by the Rashba model. The resulting photocurrents satisfy all the symmetry restrictions with respect to the light helicity and the magnetization direction. We provide microscopic insights into the symmetry and magnitude of the computed currents based on the ab-initio multi-band electronic structure of the system, and scrutinize the importance of resonant two-band and three-band transitions for driven currents, thereby establishing a benchmark picture of photocurrents at Rashba-like surfaces and interfaces. Our work contributes to the study of the role of the interfacial Rashba spin-orbit interaction as a mechanism for the generation of in-plane photocurrents, which are of great interest in the field of ultrafast and terahertz spintronics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We theoretically predict a new working principle for optical amplification, based on Weyl semimetals: when a Weyl semimetal is suitably irradiated at two frequencies, electrons close to the Weyl points convert energy between the frequencies through the mechanism of topological frequency conversion from [Martin et al, PRX 7 041008 (2017)]. Each electron converts energy at a quantized rate given by an integer multiple of Planck's constant multiplied by the product of the two frequencies. In simulations, we show that optimal, but feasible band structures can support topological frequency conversion in the "THz gap" at intensities down to $ 2{\rm W}/{\rm mm^2}$; the gain from the effect can exceed the dissipative loss when the frequencies are larger than the relaxation time of the system. Topological frequency conversion provides a new paradigm for optical amplification, and further extends Weyl semimetals' promise for technological applications.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Memristive circuit elements constitute a cornerstone for novel electronic applications, such as neuromorphic computing, called to revolutionize information technologies. By definition, memristors are sensitive to the history of electrical stimuli, to which they respond by varying their electrical resistance across a continuum of nonvolatile states. Recently, much effort has been devoted to developing devices that present an analogous response to optical excitation. Here we realize a new class of device, a tunnelling photo-memristor, whose behaviour is bimodal: both electrical and optical stimuli can trigger the switching across resistance states in a way determined by the dual optical-electrical history. This unique behaviour is obtained in a device of ultimate simplicity: an interface between a high-temperature superconductor and a transparent semiconductor. The microscopic mechanism at play is a reversible nanoscale redox reaction between both materials, whose oxygen content determines the electron tunnelling rate across their interface. Oxygen exchange is controlled here via illumination by exploiting a competition between electrochemistry, photovoltaic effects and photo-assisted ion migration. In addition to their fundamental interest, the unveiled electro-optic memory effects have considerable technological potential. Especially in combination with high-temperature superconductivity which, beyond facilitating the high connectivity required in neuromorphic circuits, brings photo-memristive effects to the realm of superconducting electronics.</p>

    <p>The temperature evolution of the resonant Raman scattering from high-quality bilayer 2H-MoS$_{2}$ encapsulated in hexagonal BN flakes is presented. The observed resonant Raman scattering spectrum as initiated by the laser energy of 1.96 eV, close to the A excitonic resonance, shows rich and distinct vibrational features that are otherwise not observed in non-resonant scattering. The appearance of 1$^{st}$ and 2$^{nd}$ order phonon modes is unambiguously observed in a broad range of temperatures from 5 K to 320 K. The spectrum includes the Raman-active modes, $i.e.$ E$_\textrm{1g}^{2}$($Œì$) and A$_\textrm{1g}$($Œì$) along with their Davydov-split counterparts, $i.e.$ E$_\textrm{1u}$($Œì$) and B$_\textrm{1u}$($Œì$). The temperature evolution of the Raman scattering spectrum brings forward key observations, as the integrated intensity profiles of different phonon modes show diverse trends. The Raman-active A$_{1g}$($Œì$) mode, which dominates the Raman scattering spectrum at $T$=5~K quenches with increasing temperature. Surprisingly, at room temperature the B$_\textrm{1u}$($Œì$) mode, which is infrared-active in the bilayer, is substantially stronger than its nominally Raman-active A$_\textrm{1g}$($Œì$) counterpart.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements were taken on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0, 0.04, and 0.08) superconductors. With an ultrahigh energy resolution of 0.4 meV, unusual two hole bands near the Brillouin-zone center, which was possibly a result of additional symmetry breaking, were identified in all the sulfur-substituted samples. In addition, in both of the hole bands highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with resolution limited nodes were evidenced. We find that the larger superconducting gap on the outer hole band is reduced linearly to the nematic transition temperature while the gap on the inner hole is nearly S-substitution independent. Our observations strongly suggest that the superconducting gap increases with enhanced nematicity although the superconducting transition temperature is not only governed by the pairing strength, demonstrating strong constraints on theories in the FeSe family.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a family of layered materials exhibiting rich exotic phenomena, such as valley-contrasting physics. Down to single-particle level, unraveling fundamental physics and potential applications including quantum information processing in these materials attracts significant research interests. To unlock these great potentials, gate-controlled quantum dot architectures have been applied in 2D materials and their heterostructures. Such systems provide the possibility of electrical confinement, control, and manipulation of single carriers in these materials. In this review, efforts in gate-controlled quantum dots in 2D materials are presented. Following basic introductions to valley degree of freedom and gate-controlled quantum dot systems, the up-to-date progress in etched and gate-defined quantum dots in 2D materials, especially in graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, is provided. The challenges and opportunities for future developments in this field, from views of device design, fabrication scheme, and control technology, are discussed. The rapid progress in this field not only sheds light on the understanding of spin-valley physics, but also provides an ideal platform for investigating diverse condensed matter physics phenomena and realizing quantum computation in the 2D limit.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using density-functional theory (DFT) and its extension to DFT+$U$, we propose a possible scenario for a strain-induced metal-insulator transition which has been reported recently in thin films of SrCrO$_3$. The metal-insulator transition involves the emergence of a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion similar to the case of the related rare-earth vanadates, which also exhibit a nominal $d^2$ occupation of the transition metal cation. Our calculations indicate that, for realistic values of the Hubbard $U$ parameter, the unstrained system exhibts a C-type antiferromagnetically ordered ground state, that is already rather close to a JT instability. However, the emergence of the JT distortion is disfavored by the large energetic overlap of the $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ band with the lower lying $d_{xy}$ band. Tensile epitaxial strain lowers the energy of the $d_{xy}$ band relative to $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ and thus brings the system closer to the nominal filling of $d_{xy}^1(d_{xz}d_{yz})^1$. The JT distortion then lifts the degeneracy between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals and thus allows to open up a gap in the electronic band structure.</p>

    <p>We report a comprehensive study on the elastic properties of a hexanary high-entropy alloy superconductor (ScZrNbTa)$_{0.685}$[RhPd]$_{0.315}$ at room and cryogenic temperatures, by Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy experiments. The derived elastic constants are bulk modulus $K=132.7$ GPa, Young's modulus $E=121.0$ GPa, shear modulus $G=44.9$ GPa, and Poisson's ratio $ŒΩ$=0.348 for room temperature. The Young's and shear moduli are $\sim 10\%$ larger than those in NbTi superconductor with similar $T_c$, while the ductility is comparable. Moreover, the mechanical performance is further enhanced at cryogenic temperature.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Every practical method to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for interacting many-particle systems introduces approximations. Such methods are therefore plagued by systematic errors. For computational chemistry, it is decisive to quantify the specific error for some system under consideration. Traditionally, the primary resource for such an error assessment have been benchmarking results, usually taken from the literature. However, their transferability to a specific molecular system, and hence, the reliability of the traditional approach always remains uncertain to some degree. In this communication, we elaborate on the shortcomings of this traditional way of static benchmarking by exploiting statistical analyses at the example of one of the largest quantum chemical benchmark sets available. We demonstrate the uncertainty of error estimates in the light of the choice of reference data selected for a benchmark study. To alleviate the issues with static benchmarks, we advocate to rely instead on a rolling and system-focused approach for rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of a quantum chemical result.</p>

    <p>The plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles can enhance and direct light from optical emitters in much the same way that radio frequency (RF) antennas enhance and direct the emission from electrical circuits. In the RF regime, a typical antenna design for high directivity is the Yagi-Uda antenna, which basically consists of a one-dimensional array of antenna elements driven by a single feed element. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of directional light emission from a nano-optical Yagi-Uda antenna composed of an array of appropriately tuned gold nanorods. Our results indicate that nano-optical antenna arrays are a simple but efficient tool for the spatial control of light emission.</p>

    <p>Local structure of REOFeAs (RE=La, Pr, Nd, Sm) system has been studied as a function of chemical pressure varied due to different rare-earth size. Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements in the fluorescence mode has permitted to compare systematically the inter-atomic distances and their mean square relative displacements (MSRD). We find that the Fe-As bond length and the corresponding MSRD hardly show any change, suggesting the strongly covalent nature of this bond, while the Fe-Fe and Fe-RE bond lengths decrease with decreasing rare earth size. The results provide important information on the atomic correlations that could have direct implication on the superconductivity and magnetism of REOFeAs system, with the chemical pressure being a key ingredient.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Sr2VO{3-delta}FeAs superconductors with different oxygen deficiencies have been successfully fabricated. It is found that the superconducting transition temperature drops down monotonically with the increase of oxygen deficiency. The diminishing of superconductivity is accompanied by the enhancement of residual resistivity, indicating an unraveled scattering effect induced by the oxygen deficiency. The highest superconducting transition temperature at about 40 K is achieved near the stoichiometrical sample Sr$_2$VO$_{3}$FeAs. Surprisingly, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the vanadium has a "5+" valence state in the samples. The Hall effect measurements reveal that the density of charge carriers (electron-like here) varies qualitatively with the increase of oxygen deficiency. Magnetotransport measurements show that the superconducting transition changes from one-step-like shape at low fields to two-step-like one at high fields, indicating a high anisotropy.</p>

    <p>We revisit a problem of theoretical description of alpha-iron. By performing LDA+DMFT calculations in the paramagnetic phase we find that Coulomb interaction and, in particular Hund exchange, yields the formation of local moments in e_g electron band, which can be traced from imaginary time dependence of the spin-spin correlation function. This behavior is accompanied by non-Fermi-liquid behavior of e_g electrons and suggests using local moment variables in the effective model of iron. By investigating orbital-selective contributions to the Curie-Weiss law for Hund exchange I=0.9 eV we obtain an effective value of local moment of e_g electrons 2p=1.04 mu_B. The effective bosonic model, which allows to describe magnetic properties of iron near the magnetic phase transition, is proposed.</p>

    <p>We propose a polarimetric method for measuring the tilt angle of the LC director at an LC layer interface.The method involves the use of an LC cell operating in the mode of the total internal reflection of the ordinary wave. The method is based on measuring the angle of the plane of light incidence on the cell with the polarization vector of the extraordinary wave passed through the cell or with the polarization vector of the ordinary wave reflected from the cell. To calculate the tilt angle, the polarization azimuth of the light incident on the cell, which induces only the ordinary wave, can be also used.The method is applicable throughout the whole range of the LC director tilt angles.</p>

    <p>A new method for calculation of band structure has been proposed based on the Green's function theory and local sampling. Potential energy in the Hamiltonian of Schrodinger's equation is approximated with a series of sampled Dirac delta functions weighted by appropriate factors. These factors are found from multipole expansion of atomic potentials in the crystal lattice, with considering effects such as screening. Fourier transform was then applied to describe the wave function in reciprocal space. Sampling can be uniform or non-uniform throughout space; however rate and interval optimization is essential. Theory was implemented for Silicon, Germanium and Graphene sheet individually, while results were compared with the ab-initio non-local pseudopotential (AINLPS) method. Also for Silicon, the pseudopotential used in orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) was employed as a suitable sampling source. Phase variations of the dispersion formula are analyzed, introducing adapting parameters to improve compatibility with ab-initio results. Local analysis with low order truncation in real space, reduces implementation time while giving acceptable results.</p>

    <p>We have studied the dynamic response of Fe doped manganites with ac susceptibility measurements on bulk La0.65Ca0.35Mn1-yFeyO3 with 0.01<y<0.10 as functions of temperature and dc field. It is observed that the in phase part goes through a maximum that is removed on the application of moderate dc field. DC fields suppress both the components with the strongest effects being at or close to Tc. Conduction and ferromagnetism has been consistently suppressed by Fe doping. Increased spin disorder and decrease of Tc with increasing Fe content are evident. The variations in the critical temperature Tc and magnetic moment show a rapid change at about 4-5% Fe. The effect of Fe is seen to be consistent with the disruption of the Mn-Mn exchange possibly due to the formation of magnetic clusters. There is clear correlation between the structures in the resistivity and the in and out of phase parts of the susceptibility. With increasing Fe concentration the out of phase part (x'') peak shift to T<T1/2, but it stays consistently at the temperature where the resistivity changes slow down. The shoulder in x'' disappears above 4% Fe concentration. The peak of x'' moves to 8 or 10 K higher temperature on the application of a dc field, for 3 & 4 %Fe samples. Consistently two peaks are found in the ratios of x''/x'. We are seeing correspondence of dissipation with the change in R. We also see increasing low temperature dissipation in more strongly Fe doped samples i.e. increasing the Fe, leads to increased spin disorder and dissipation at low temperature. The effect of the dc field is discussed in terms of the suppression of spin fluctuations close to Tc and the changes in coercivity for lower temperatures.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The molecular mechanism of slip at the interface between polymer melts and weakly attractive smooth surfaces is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with our previous studies on slip flow of shear-thinning fluids, it is shown that the slip length passes through a local minimum at low shear rates and then increases rapidly at higher shear rates. We found that at sufficiently high shear rates, the slip flow over atomically flat crystalline surfaces is anisotropic. It is demonstrated numerically that the friction coefficient at the liquid-solid interface (the ratio of viscosity and slip length) undergoes a transition from a constant value to the power-law decay as a function of the slip velocity. The characteristic velocity of the transition correlates well with the diffusion velocity of fluid monomers in the first fluid layer near the solid wall at equilibrium. We also show that in the linear regime, the friction coefficient is well described by a function of a single variable, which is a product of the magnitude of surface-induced peak in the structure factor and the contact density of the adjacent fluid layer. The universal relationship between the friction coefficient and induced fluid structure holds for a number of material parameters of the interface: fluid density, chain length, wall-fluid interaction energy, wall density, lattice type and orientation, thermal or solid walls.</p>

    <p>The spatial fluctuations of deformation are studied in creep in the Andrade's power-law and the logarithmic phases, using paper samples. Measurements by the Digital Image Correlation technique show that the relative strength of the strain rate fluctuations increases with time, in both creep regimes. In the Andrade creep phase characterized by a power law decay of the strain rate $Œµ_t \sim t^{-Œ∏}$, with $Œ∏\approx 0.7$, the fluctuations obey $ŒîŒµ_t \sim t^{-Œ≥}$, with $Œ≥\approx 0.5$. The local deformation follows a data collapse appropriate for an absorbing state/depinning transition. Similar behavior is found in a crystal plasticity model, with a jamming or yielding phase transition.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have used neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation (muSR) to investigate the structural and magnetic properties of the beta-phase of elemental manganese doped with dilute amounts of indium. beta-Mn is an example of a topologically frustrated antiferromagnetically correlated metal - but which remains paramagnetic at all temperatures. The addition of In to beta-Mn results in a vast volume expansion of the lattice, and would therefore be expected to have a major effect on the stability and localization of the Mn moment - as observed in, for example, Ru and Al doped beta-Mn alloys. We find that In doping in beta-Mn results in a short-range ordered spin-glass like ground state, similar to that of Al-doped beta-Mn but with residual low frequency spin fluctuations. This is in contrast to Ru doping which results in the stabilization of a long-range ordered Mn moment</p>

    <p>We present the results of numerical analysis of normal zone propagation in a stack of $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x}$ coated conductors which imitates a pancake coil. Our main purpose is to determine whether the quench protection quality of such coils can be substantially improved by increased contact resistance between the superconducting film and the stabilizer. We show that with increased contact resistance the speed of normal zone propagation increases, the detection of a normal zone inside the coil becomes possible earlier, when the peak temperature inside the normal zone is lower, and stability margins shrink. Thus, increasing contact resistance may become a viable option for improving the prospects of coated conductors for high $T_c$ magnets applications.</p>

    <p>We report the experimental and the analytical results of electron spin resonance (ESR) and magnetization in high magnetic fields up to about 68 T of the quasi two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$.
  From the temperature evolution of the ESR absorption linewidth, we find a distinct disturbing of the development of the spin correlation by $Z_2$-vortices between 23 K and 8.5 K. Below $T_{\rm{v}}=8.5$ K, spin-wave calculations based on a 57$^{\circ}$ spiral spin order well explains the frequency dependence of the ESR resonance fields and high field magnetization processes for $H$$\parallel$$c$ and $H$$\perp$$c$, although the magnetization for $H$$\perp$$c$ at high fields is different from the calculated one. Furthermore, we explain the field independent specific heat with $T^2$-dependence by the same spin-wave calculation, but the magnitude of the specific heat is much less than the observed one. Accordingly, these results suggest the occurrence of a $Z_2$ vortex-induced topological transition at $T_{\rm{v}}$ and may indicate quantum effects beyond the descriptions based on the above classical spin models.</p>

    <p>The liquid, plastic crystalline and ordered crystalline phases of CBr$_4$ were studied using neutron powder diffraction. The measured total scattering differential cross-sections were modelled by Reverse Monte Carlo simulation techniques (RMC++ and RMCPOW). Following successful simulations, the single crystal diffraction pattern of the plastic phase, as well as partial radial distribution functions and orientational correlations for all the three phases have been calculated from the atomic coordinates ('particle configurations'). The single crystal pattern, calculated from a configuration that had been obtained from modelling the powder pattern, shows identical behavior to the recent single crystal data of Folmer et al. (Phys. Rev. {\bf B77}, 144205 (2008)). The BrBr partial radial distribution functions of the liquid and plastic crystalline phases are almost the same, while CC correlations clearly display long range ordering in the latter phase. Orientational correlations also suggest strong similarities between liquid and plastic crystalline phases, whereas the monoclinic phase behaves very differently. Orientations of the molecules are distinct in the ordered phase, whereas in the plastic crystal their distribution seems to be isotropic.</p>

A non-local magnetoresistance (ŒîRNL) of 130 Œ© is observed at room temperature, which is the largest value observed in any material. Investigating ŒîRNL vs. SLG conductivity from the transparent to the tunneling contact regimes demonstrates the contrasting behaviors predicted by the drift-diffusion theory of spin transport. Furthermore, tunnel barriers reduce the contact-induced spin relaxation and are therefore important for future investigations of spin relaxation in graphene.</p>

    <p>Many technological applications of multiferroics are based on their ability to reconstruct the domain structure (DS) under the action of small external fields. In the present paper we analyze the different scenarios of the DS behavior in a multiferroic that shows simultaneously ferro- and antiferromagnetic ordering on the different systems of magnetic ions. We consider the way to control a composition of the DS and macroscopic properties of the sample by an appropriate field treatment. We found out that sensitivity of the DS to the  external magnetic field and the magnetic susceptibility in a low-field region are determined mainly by the destressing effects (that have magnetoelastic origin). In a particular case of Sr$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{4}$Cl$_{2}$ crystal we anticipate the peculiarities of the elastic and magnetoelastic properties at $T\approx 100$ K.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Topological insulators (TIs) constitute a new class of materials with unique properties resulting from the relativistic-like character and topological protection of their surface states. Theory predicts these to exhibit a rich variety of physical phenomena such as anomalous magneto-electric coupling and Majorana excitations. Although TI surface states have been detected in Bi-based compounds by ARPES and STM techniques, electrical control over their density, required for most transport experiments, remains a challenge. Existing materials are heavily doped in the bulk, thus preventing electrical tunability of the surface states and their integration into topological quantum electronic devices. Here we show that electronic transport in metallic Bi2Se3 nanoscale devices can be controlled by tuning the surface density via the electric field effect. By choosing an appropriate high-k dielectric, we are able to shift the Fermi energy through the charge neutrality point of the surface states, resulting in ambipolar transport characteristics reminiscent of those observed in graphene. Combining magnetotransport, field effect, and geometry dependent experiments, we provide transport measurements of the surface state mobility, and identify likely scattering mechanisms by measuring its temperature dependence.</p>

    <p>The phase field crystal (PFC) model captures the elastic and topological properties of crystals with a single scalar field at small undercooling. At large undercooling, new foam-like behavior emerges. We characterize this foam phase of the PFC equation and propose a modified PFC equation that may be used for the simulation of foam dynamics. This minimal model reproduces von Neumann's rule for two-dimensional dry foams, and Lifshitz-Slyozov coarsening for wet foams.  We also measure the coordination number distribution and find that its second moment is larger than previously-reported experimental and theoretical studies of soap froths, a finding that we attribute to the wetness of the foam increasing with time.</p>

    <p>Cupric oxide is multiferroic at unusual high temperatures. From density functional calculations we find that the low-T magnetic phase is paraelectric and the higher-T one ferroelectric, with a size and direction of polarization in good agreement with experiment. By mapping of the ab initio results on an effective spin model we find with Monte Carlo that in the high-T magnetic state non-collinearity and inversion symmetry breaking stabilize each other via the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. This leads to a novel mechanism for multiferroicity, with the particular property that non-magnetic impurities enhance the effect.</p>

The influence of vacancy-vacancy and vacancy-cation interactions on the conductivity of these materials has been characterised. While the latter can be avoided by using dopant cations with radii which match those of Zr4+ (as is the case of Sc3+), the former is an intrinsic characteristic of the fluorite lattice which cannot be avoided and which is shown to be responsible for the occurrence of a maximum in the conductivity at dopant concentrations between 8 and 13 %.

    <p>We investigate the behavior of vortices of multi-component superconductivity, realized in $\rm{MgB_2}$ and Fe-based superconductors, within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory in terms of numerical calculations of the time-dependent GL equations and the variational method. It is revealed that close to the critical point of the composite system the inter-component coupling makes the system behave as a single component superconductivity in most cases. However, when the bare mean-field critical points of the two components coincide with each other, and furthermore the inter-band coupling disappears at the same temperature, interesting phenomena occur as follows. Vortices interact attractively at large separation and repulsively at short distance in certain parameter space. Because of the non-monotonic interaction profile, phase separations between vortex clusters of triangular order and the Meissner state take place, which indicates a first-order phase transition associated with the penetration of the magnetic field into a superconductor sample. Phase diagrams of vortex states are then constructed with the associated magnetization curve. It is found that all these behavior interpolates the features of the type I and II superconductors.</p>

    <p>We report on the microscopic model of the recently synthesized one-dimensional quantum magnet (NO)Cu(NO3)3. Applying density functional theory band structure calculations, we obtain a leading antiferromagnetic exchange coupling J ~ 200 K, which runs via NO3 groups forming spin chains along the b direction. Much weaker couplings J' ~ 2 K link the chains into layers in a non-frustrated manner. Our calculations do not support the earlier conjecture on an anisotropic frustrated square lattice physics in (NO)Cu(NO3)3. In contrast, the model of uniform spin chains leads to a remarkably good fit of the experimental magnetic susceptibility data, although the low-temperature features of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility measured by electron spin resonance might call for extension of the model. We outline possible experiments to observe the suggested long-range magnetic ordering in (NO)Cu(NO3)3 and briefly compare this compound to other spin-1/2 uniform-chain systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Quantum interference incorporating spatially asymmetric potential profiles is realized experimentally to manipulate a magnetic domain wall (DW) into a single multilayered wire whose spacer has a thickness gradient for generating asymmetrical interlayer exchange coupling from side to side. We demonstrate experimentally how to guide a DW in a micron-scale ferromagnetic wire without reflection symmetry of the interlayer exchange coupling. This is the ratcheting of a DW in a form of ratchet potential using quantum interference. The experimental results can be described well by numerical simulations considering spatially asymmetric potential profiles due to quantum interference.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We demonstrate that the intrinsic properties of monolayer graphene allow it to act as a more effective saturable absorber for mode-locking fiber lasers compared to multilayer graphene. The absorption of monolayer graphene can be saturated at lower excitation intensity compared to multilayer graphene, graphene with wrinkle-like defects, and functionalized graphene. Monolayer graphene has a remarkable large modulation depth of 95.3%, whereas the modulation depth of multilayer graphene is greatly reduced due to nonsaturable absorption and scattering loss. Picoseconds ultrafast laser pulse (1.23 ps) can be generated using monolayer graphene as saturable absorber. Due to the ultrafast relaxation time, larger modulation depth and lower scattering loss of monolayer graphene, it performs better than multilayer graphene in terms of pulse shaping ability, pulse stability and output energy.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have investigated several strong spin-orbit coupling ternary chalcogenides related to the (Pb,Sn)Te series of compounds. Our first-principles calculations predict the low temperature rhombohedral ordered phase in TlBiTe2, TlBiSe2, and TlSbX2 (X=Te, Se, S) to be topologically Kane-Mele Z2 = -1 nontrivial. We identify the specific surface termination that realizes the single Dirac cone through first-principles surface state computations. This termination minimizes effects of dangling bonds making it favorable for photoemission (ARPES) experiments. Our analysis predicts that thin films of these materials would harbor novel 2D quantum spin Hall states, and support odd-parity topological superconductivity. For a related work also see arXiv:1003.2615v1. Experimental ARPES results will be published elsewhere.</p>

    <p>The tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition (SPT) in LaFeAsO (La-1111) and SmFeAsO (Sm-1111) single crystals measured by high resolution x-ray diffraction is found to be sharp while the RFeAsO (R=La, Nd, Pr, Sm) polycrystalline samples show a broad continuous SPT. Comparing the polycrystalline and the single crystal 1111 samples, the critical exponents of the SPT are found to be the same while the correlation length critical exponents are found to be very different. These results imply that the lattice fluctuations in 1111 systems change in samples with different surface to volume ratio that is assigned to the relieve of the temperature dependent superlattice misfit strain between active iron layers and the spacer layers in 1111 systems. This phenomenon that is missing in the AFe2As2 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba) "122" systems, with the same electronic structure but different for the thickness and the elastic constant of the spacer layers, is related with the different maximum superconducting transition temperature in the 1111 (55 K) versus 122 (35 K) systems and implies the surface reconstruction in 1111 single crystals.</p>

    <p>We study the robustness of Majorana zero energy modes and minigaps of quasiparticle excitations in a vortex by numerically solving Bogoliubov-deGennes equations in a heterostructure composed of an \textit{s} -wave superconductor, a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor thin film, and a magnetic insulator. This heterostructure was proposed recently as a platform for observing non-Abelian statistics and performing topological quantum computation. The dependence of the Majorana zero energy states and the minigaps on various physics parameters (Zeeman field, chemical potential, spin-orbit coupling strength) is characterized. We find the minigaps depend strongly on the spin-orbit coupling strength. In certain parameter region, the minigaps are linearly proportional to the \textit{s}-wave superconducting pairing gap $Œî_{s}$, which is very different from the $Œî_{s}^{2}$ dependence in a regular \textit{s-} or \textit{\p}-wave superconductor. We characterize the zero energy chiral edge state at the boundary and calculate the STM signal in the vortex core that shows a pronounced zero energy peak. We show that the Majorana zero energy states are robust in the presence of various types of impurities. We find the existence of impurity potential may increase the minigaps and thus benefit topological quantum computation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Magnetoelectric responses are a fundamental characteristic of materials that break time-reversal and inversion symmetries (notably multiferroics) and, remarkably, of "topological insulators" in which those symmetries are unbroken. Previous work has shown how to compute spin and lattice contributions to the magnetoelectric tensor. Here we solve the problem of orbital contributions by computing the frozen-lattice electronic polarization induced by a magnetic field. One part of this response (the "Chern-Simons term") can appear even in time-reversal-symmetric materials and has been previously shown to be quantized in topological insulators. In general materials there are additional orbital contributions to all parts of the magnetoelectric tensor; these vanish in topological insulators by symmetry and also vanish in several simplified models without time-reversal and inversion those magnetoelectric couplings were studied before. We give two derivations of the response formula, one based on a uniform magnetic field and one based on extrapolation of a long-wavelength magnetic field, and discuss some of the consequences of this formula.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We extend the recently-developed theory of bulk orbital magnetization to finite electric fields, and use it to calculate the orbital magnetoelectric response of periodic insulators. Working in the independent-particle framework, we find that the finite-field orbital magnetization can be written as a sum of three gauge-invariant contributions, one of which has no counterpart at zero field. The extra contribution is collinear with and explicitly dependent on the electric field. The expression for the orbital magnetization is suitable for first-principles implementations, allowing to calculate the magnetoelectric response coefficients by numerical differentiation. Alternatively, perturbation-theory techniques may be used, and for that purpose we derive an expression directly for the linear magnetoelectric tensor by taking the first field-derivative analytically. Two types of terms are obtained. One, the `Chern-Simons' term, depends only on the unperturbed occupied orbitals and is purely isotropic. The other, `Kubo' term, involves the first-order change in the orbitals and gives isotropic as well as anisotropic contributions to the response. In ordinary magnetoelectric insulators both terms are generally present, while in strong Z2 topological insulators only the former type is allowed, and is quantized. In order to validate the theory we have calculated under periodic boundary conditions the linear magnetoelectric coupling for a 3-D tight-binding model of an ordinary magnetoelectric insulator, using both the finite-field and perturbation-theory expressions. The results are in excellent agreement with calculations on bounded samples.</p>

    <p>We report ac magnetic susceptibility and dc magnetization measurements on the superconducting ferromagnet UCoGe (with superconducting and Curie temperatures of $T_{\rm SC} \sim 0.5$~K and $T_{\rm Curie} \sim 2.5$~K, respectively). In the normal, ferromagnetic state ($T_{\rm SC} < T < T_{\rm Curie}$), the magnetization curve exhibits a hysteresis loop similar to that of a regular itinerant ferromagnet. Upon lowering the temperature below $T_{\rm SC}$, the spontaneous magnetization is unchanged, but the hysteresis is markedly enhanced. Even deeply inside the superconducting state, ferromagnetism is not completely shielded, and there is no Meissner region, a magnetic field region of $H < H_{\rm c1}$ (a lower critical field). From these results, we suggest that UCoGe is the first material in which ferromagnetism robustly survives in the superconducting state and a spontaneous vortex state without the Meissner state is realized.</p>

    <p>In a previous paper [Jiao, Stillinger and Torquato, PRE 81, 011105 (2010)], we considered the geometrical ambiguity of pair statistics associated with point configurations. Here we focus on the analogous problem for heterogeneous media (materials). The complex structures of heterogeneous media are usually characterized via statistical descriptors, such as the $n$-point correlation function $S_n$. An intricate inverse problem of practical importance is to what extent a medium can be reconstructed from the two-point correlation function $S_2$ of a target medium. Recently, general claims of the uniqueness of reconstructions using $S_2$ have been made based on numerical studies. Here, we provide a systematic approach to characterize the geometrical ambiguity of $S_2$ for both continuous two-phase heterogeneous media and their digitized representations in a mathematically precise way. In particular, we derive the exact conditions for the case where two distinct media possess identical $S_2$. The degeneracy conditions are given in terms of integral and algebraic equations for continuous media and their digitized representations, respectively. By examining these equations and constructing their rigorous solutions for specific examples, we conclusively show that in general $S_2$ is indeed not sufficient information to uniquely determine the structure of the medium, which is consistent with the results of our recent study on heterogeneous media reconstruction [Jiao, Stillinger and Torquato, PNAS 106, 17634 (2009)]. The uniqueness issue of multiphase media reconstructions and additional structural information required to characterize heterogeneous media are discussed.</p>

    <p>Linear magnetoresistance occurs in semiconductors as a consequence of strong electrical disorder and is characterized by nonsaturating magnetoresistance that is proportional to the applied magnetic field. By investigating a disordered MnAs-GaAs composite material, it is found that the magnitude of the linear magnetoresistance (LMR) is numerically equal to the carrier mobility over a wide range and is independent of carrier density. This behavior is complementary to the Hall effect that is independent of the mobility and dependent on the carrier density. Moreover, the LMR appears to be insensitive to the details of the disorder and points to a universal explanation of classical LMR that can be applied to other material systems.</p>

    <p>Most materials in available macroscopic quantities are polycrystalline. Graphene, a recently discovered two-dimensional form of carbon with strong potential for replacing silicon in future electronics, is no exception. There is growing evidence of the polycrystalline nature of graphene samples obtained using various techniques. Grain boundaries, intrinsic topological defects of polycrystalline materials, are expected to dramatically alter the electronic transport in graphene. Here, we develop a theory of charge carrier transmission through grain boundaries composed of a periodic array of dislocations in graphene based on the momentum conservation principle. Depending on the grain boundary structure we find two distinct transport behaviours - either high transparency, or perfect reflection of charge carriers over remarkably large energy ranges. First-principles quantum transport calculations are used to verify and further investigate this striking behaviour. Our study sheds light on the transport properties of large-area graphene samples. Furthermore, purposeful engineering of periodic grain boundaries with tunable transport gaps would allow for controlling charge currents without the need of introducing bulk band gaps in otherwise semimetallic graphene. The proposed approach can be regarded as a means towards building practical graphene electronics.</p>

    <p>We study charge fractionalization in bilayer graphene which is intimately related to its zero modes. In the unbiased case, the valley zero modes occur in pairs rendering it unsuitable for charge fractionalization. A bias plays the role of a bosonic field with nontrivial topology allowing for the exploration of Dirac-like dynamics at higher particle momenta. It also induces an odd number of zero modes, which, together with the conjugation symmetry between positive and negative energy states, are the requisite conditions for charge fractionalization. A self-conjugate, localized zero mode is constructed for a semi-infinite graphene sheet with zigzag edge; scenarios can occur readily where one sublattice component (pseudospin) dominates. While the other valley also has a similar zero mode, a layer asymmetry can be invoked to lift this degeneracy allowing for detection of distinguishable charge-1/2 edge states per valley.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work we argue that it is important to make a proper choice of the unit cell within tight-binding theory if one aims to compute the optical matrix elements. By considering zigzag graphene nanoribbons, we demonstrate that the band structure is insensitive to the choice of the unit cell. However, if the chosen unit cell does not incorporate the symmetries of the system, wrong values of optical matrix elements are obtained, leading to the violation of well-known selection rules. This result holds irrespective of the formalism utilized for calculating the optical matrix elements.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Heat engines provide most of our mechanical power and are essential for transportation on macroscopic scale. However, although significant progress has been made in the miniaturization of electrostatic engines, it has proven difficult to reduce the size of liquid or gas driven heat engines below 10^7 um^3. Here we demonstrate that a crystalline silicon structure operates as a cyclic piezoresistive heat engine when it is driven by a sufficiently high DC current. A 0.34 um^3 engine beam draws heat from the DC current using the piezoresistive effect and converts it into mechanical work by expansion and contraction at different temperatures. This mechanical power drives a silicon resonator of 1.1x10^3 um^3 into sustained oscillation. Even below the oscillation threshold the engine beam continues to amplify the resonator's Brownian motion. When its thermodynamic cycle is inverted, the structure is shown to reduce these thermal fluctuations, therefore operating as a refrigerator.</p>

    <p>We have studied a bulk electrolyte, and polyelectrolyte solutions with surfactants or multivalent salt with the explicit presence of counterions and solvent molecules by means of the mesoscopic dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method in the Grand Canonical ensemble. The electrostatic interactions are calculated using the Ewald sum method and the structure of the fluid is analyzed through the radial distribution function between charged particles. The results are in very good agreement with those reported in the literature using a different method for the calculation of the electrostatic forces, and with those obtained using DPD in the canonical ensemble. We also studied the salt dependent conformation of polyelectrolyte solutions as a function of the solvent quality, and analyzed the electrostatic interaction strength dependence of dilute flexible polyelectrolytes in solution. For the complex systems mentioned above, the electrostatic interactions and the solvent quality play a key role in understanding phenomena that do not occur in noncharged systems.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The Hall effect, the anomalous Hall effect and the spin Hall effect are fundamental transport processes in solids arising from the Lorentz force and the spin-orbit coupling respectively. The quantum versions of the Hall effect and the spin Hall effect have been discovered in recent years. However, the quantized anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has not yet been realized experimentally. In a QAH insulator, spontaneous magnetic moments and spin-orbit coupling combine to give rise to a topologically non-trivial electronic structure, leading to the quantized Hall effect without any external magnetic field. In this work, based on state-of-art first principles calculations, we predict that the tetradymite semiconductors Bi$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ form magnetically ordered insulators when doped with transition metal elements (Cr or Fe), in sharp contrast to conventional dilute magnetic semiconductor where free carriers are necessary to mediate the magnetic coupling. Magnetic order in two-dimensional thin films gives rise to a topological electronic structure characterized by a finite Chern number, with quantized Hall conductance $e^{2}/h$. Experimental realization of the long sought-after QAH insulator state could enable robust dissipationless charge transport at room temperature.</p>

    <p>We propose new semi-implicit numerical methods for the integration of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation with built-in angular momentum conservation. The performance of the proposed integrators is tested on the 1D Heisenberg chain. For this system, our schemes show better stability properties and allow us to use considerably larger time steps than standard explicit methods. At the same time, these semi-implicit schemes are also of comparable accuracy to and computationally much cheaper than the standard midpoint implicit method. The results are of key importance for atomistic spin dynamics simulations and the study of spin dynamics beyond the macro spin approximation.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The recently developed void expansion method (VEM) allows for an efficient generation of porous packings of spherical particles over a wide range of volume fractions. The method is based on a random placement of the structural particles under addition of much smaller "void-particles" whose radii are repeatedly increased during the void expansion. Thereby, they rearrange the structural particles until formation of a dense particle packing and introduce local heterogeneities in the structure. In this paper, microstructures with volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.6 produced by VEM are analyzed with respect to their degree of heterogeneity (DOH). In particular, the influence of the void- to structural particle number ratio, which constitutes a principal VEM-parameter, on the DOH is studied. The DOH is quantified using the pore size distribution, the Voronoi volume distribution and the density-fluctuation method in conjunction with fit functions or integral measures. This analysis has revealed that for volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.55 the void-particle number allows for a quasi-continuous adjustment of the DOH. Additionally, the DOH-range of VEM-generated microstructures with a volume fraction of 0.4 is compared to the range covered by microstructures generated using previous Brownian dynamics simulations, which represent the structure of coagulated colloidal suspensions. Both sets of microstructures cover similarly broad and overlapping DOH-ranges, which allows concluding that VEM is an efficient method to stochastically reproduce colloidal microstructures with varying DOH.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using $\vec{k}$$\cdot$$\vec{p}$ theory, we derive an effective four band model describing the physics of the typical two-dimensional topological insulator (HgTe/CdTe quantum well) in the presence of out-of-plane in z-direction inversion breaking and in-plane confining potentials. We find that up to third order in perturbation theory, only the inversion breaking potential generates new elements to the four band Hamiltonian that are off-diagonal in spin space. When this new effective Hamiltonian is folded into an effective two band model for the conduction (electron) or valence (heavy hole) bands, two competing terms appear: (1) a Rashba spin-orbit interaction originating from inversion breaking potential in z-direction and (2) an in-plane Pauli term as a consequence of the in-plane confining potential. Spin transport in the conduction band is further analysed within the Landauer-B√ºttiker formalism. We find that for asymmetrically doped HgTe quantum wells, the behaviour of the spin-Hall conductance is dominated by the Rashba term.</p>

We discuss the origin of this phenomena, and systematically study the dependence of spin-flip and spin-conserving scattering amplitudes on the interface transparency and metal Fermi surface parameters. The interface spectrum contains a well-defined Dirac cone in the tunneling limit, and smoothly evolves into a continuum of metal induced gap states for good contacts.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the simplest model of an ionic liquid, called the restricted primitive model, at a metal surface. We find that at moderately low temperatures the capacitance of the metal/ionic liquid interface is so large that the effective thickness of the electrostatic double-layer is up to 3 times smaller than the ion radius. To interpret these results we suggest an approach which is based on the interaction between discrete ions and their image charges in the metal surface and which therefore goes beyond the mean-field approximation. When a voltage is applied across the interface, the strong image attraction causes counterions to condense onto the metal surface to form compact ion-image dipoles. These dipoles repel each other to form a correlated liquid. When the surface density of these dipoles is low, the insertion of an additional dipole does not require much energy. This leads to a large capacitance $C$ that decreases monotonically with voltage $V$, producing a "bell-shaped" curve $C(V)$. We also consider what happens when the electrode is made from a semi-metal rather than a perfect metal. In this case, the finite screening radius of the electrode shifts the reflection plane for image charges to the interior of the electrode and we arrive at a "camel-shaped" $C(V)$. These predictions seem to be in qualitative agreement with experiment.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Mean-field theories claim that the capacitance of the double-layer formed at a metal/ionic conductor interface cannot be larger than that of the Helmholtz capacitor, whose width is equal to the radius of an ion. However, in some experiments the apparent width of the double-layer capacitor is substantially smaller. We propose an alternate, non-mean-field theory of the ionic double-layer to explain such large capacitance values. Our theory allows for the binding of discrete ions to their image charges in the metal, which results in the formation of interface dipoles. We focus primarily on the case where only small cations are mobile and other ions form an oppositely-charged background. In this case, at small temperature and zero applied voltage dipoles form a correlated liquid on both contacts. We show that at small voltages the capacitance of the double-layer is determined by the transfer of dipoles from one electrode to the other and is therefore limited only by the weak dipole-dipole repulsion between bound ions, so that the capacitance is very large. At large voltages the depletion of bound ions from one of the capacitor electrodes triggers a collapse of the capacitance to the much smaller mean-field value, as seen in experimental data. We test our analytical predictions with a Monte Carlo simulation and find good agreement. We further argue that our ``one-component plasma" model should work well for strongly asymmetric ion liquids. We believe that this work also suggests an improved theory of pseudo-capacitance.</p>

    <p>Nanomagnetism has recently attracted explosive attention, in particular, because of the enormous potential applications in information industry, e.g. new harddisk technology, race-track memory[1], and logic devices[2]. Recent technological advances[3] allow for the fabrication of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles (Stoner particles), whose magnetization dynamics have been extensively studied, both experimentally and theoretically, involving magnetic fields[4-9] and/or by spin-polarized currents[10-20]. From an industrial point of view, important issues include lowering the critical switching field $H_c$, and achieving short reversal times. Here we predict a new technological perspective: $H_c$ can be dramatically lowered (including $H_c=0$) by appropriately engineering the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) in a system of two synchronized Stoner particles. Here, in a modified Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) limit, both of the above goals can be achieved. The experimental feasibility of realizing our proposal is illustrated on the example of cobalt nanoparticles.</p>

    <p>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) exploits surface plasmons induced by the incident field in metallic nanostructures to significantly increase the Raman intensity. Graphene provides the ideal prototype two dimensional (2d) test material to investigate SERS. Its Raman spectrum is well known, graphene samples are entirely reproducible, height controllable down to the atomic scale, and can be made virtually defect-free. We report SERS from graphene, by depositing arrays of Au particles of well defined dimensions on graphene/SiO$_2$(300nm)/Si. We detect significant enhancements at 633nm. To elucidate the physics of SERS, we develop a quantitative analytical and numerical theory. The 2d nature of graphene allows for a closed-form description of the Raman enhancement. This scales with the nanoparticle cross section, the fourth power of the Mie enhancement, and is inversely proportional to the tenth power of the separation between graphene and the nanoparticle. One consequence is that metallic nanodisks are an ideal embodiment for SERS in 2d.</p>

Ir ions form a pyrochlore sublattice, which is known to give rise to a strong geometrical frustration.

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Using first-principles density functional calculations, we study the interplay of ferroelectricity and polar discontinuities in a range of 1-1 oxide superlattices, built out of ferroelectric and paraelectric components. Studies have been carried out for a varied choice of chemical composition of the components. We find that, when polar interfaces are present, the polar discontinuities induce off- centric movements in the ferroelectric layers, even though the ferroelectric is only one unit cell thick. The distortions yield non-switchable polarizations, with magnitudes comparable to those of the corresponding bulk ferroelectrics. In contrast, in superlattices with no polar discontinuity at the interfaces, the off-centric movements in the ferroelectric layer are usually suppressed. The details of the behavior and functional properties are, however, found to be sensitive to epitaxial strain, rotational instabilities and second-order Jahn-Teller activity, and are therefore strongly in uenced by the chemical composition of the paraelectric layer.</p>

    <p>We propose a topological order parameter for interacting topological insulators, expressed in terms of the full Green's functions of the interacting system. We show that it is exactly quantized for a time reversal invariant topological insulator, and it can be experimentally measured through the topological magneto-electric effect. This topological order parameter can be applied to both interacting and disordered systems, and used for determining their phase diagrams.</p>

    <p>Stimulated by the recent observation of œÄ-œÄ interactions between C60 and corannulene subunits in a molecular tweezer arrangement (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 3842), a density functional theory study was performed to analyze the electronic structure and properties of various noncovalent corannulene complexes. The theoretical approach is first applied to corannulene complexes with a series of benchmark molecules (CH4, NH3, and H2O) using several new-generation density functionals. The performance of nine density functionals, illustrated by computing binding energies of the corannulene complexes, demonstrates that Zhao and Truhlar's MPWB1K and M05-2X functionals provide energies similar to that obtained at the SCS-MP2 level. In contrast, most of the other popular density functionals fail to describe this noncovalent interaction or yield purely repulsive interactions. Further investigations with the M05-2X functional show that the binding energy of C60 with corannulene subunits in the relaxed molecular receptor clip geometry is -20.67 kcal/mol. The results of this calculation further support the experimental interpretation of pure œÄ-œÄ interactions between a convex fullerene and the concave surfaces of two corannulene subunits.</p>

    <p>Magnetic anisotropies of Co-implanted ZnO (0001) films grown on single-crystalline Al2O3 (11-20) substrates have been studied by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) technique for different cobalt implantation doses. The FMR data show that the easy and hard axes have a periodicity of 60 degrees in the film plane, in agreement with the hexagonal structure of the ZnO films. This six-fold in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which is observed for the first time in ZnO-based diluted magnetic semiconductors, is attributed to the substitution of cobalt on Zn sites in the ZnO structure, and a clear indication for long range ferromagnetic ordering between substitutional cobalt ions in the single-crystalline ZnO films.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A Fano-like phonon resonance is observed in few-layer (~3) graphene at room temperature using infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. This Fano resonance is the manifestation of a strong electron-phonon interaction between the discrete in-plane lattice vibrational mode and continuum electronic excitations in graphene. By employing ammonia chemical doping, we have obtained different Fano line shapes ranging from anti-resonance in hole-doped graphene to phonon-dominated in n-type graphene. The Fano resonance shows the strongest interference feature when the Fermi level is located near the Dirac point. The charged phonon exhibits much-enhanced oscillator strength and experiences a continuous red shift in frequency as electron density increases. It is suggested that the phonon couples to different electronic transitions as Fermi level is tuned by chemical doping.</p>

    <p>Electron spin dynamics in intrinsic bulk Indium Phosphide (InP) semiconductor is studied by time resolved pump probe reflectivity (TRPPR) technique using the co- and counter-circularly polarized femtosecond pulses at room temperature and 70 K. The reflectivity change from bleaching into absorption is observed with increasing pump photon energy, which can be explained in terms of the spin sensitive band filling and band gap renormalization effects. Density dependence of electron spin relaxation time shows similar tendency at room temperature and 70 K. With increasing carrier density, the electron spin relaxation time increases and then decreases after reaching a maximum value. Our experimental results agree well with the recent theoretical prediction [Jiang and Wu, Phys. Rev. B 79, 125206 (2009)] and D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism is considered as a dominating contribution to the electron spin relaxation in intrinsic bulk InP semiconductor.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This paper describes a numerical experiment, based on full micromagnetic simulations of current-driven magnetization dynamics in nanoscale spin valves, to identify the origins of spectral linewidth broadening in spin torque oscillators. Our numerical results show two qualitatively different regimes of magnetization dynamics at zero temperature: regular (single-mode precessional dynamics) and chaotic. In the regular regime, the  dependence of the oscillator integrated power on frequency is linear, and consequently the dynamics is well described by the analytical theory of current-driven magnetization dynamics for moderate amplitudes of oscillations. We observe that for higher oscillator amplitudes, the functional dependence of the oscillator integrated power as a function of frequency is not a single-valued function and can be described numerically via introduction of nonlinear oscillator power. For a range of currents in the regular regime, the oscillator spectral linewidth is a linear function of temperature. In the chaotic regime found at large current values, the linewidth is not described by the analytical theory. In this regime we observe the oscillator linewidth broadening, which originates from sudden jumps of frequency of the oscillator arising from random domain wall nucleation and propagation through the sample. This intermittent behavior is revealed through a wavelet analysis that gives superior description of the frequency jumps compared to several other techniques.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Semiconductor glasses exhibit many unique optical and electronic anomalies. We have put forth a semi-phenomenological scenario (J. Chem. Phys. 132, 044508 (2010)) in which several of these anomalies arise from deep midgap electronic states residing on high-strain regions intrinsic to the activated transport above the glass transition. Here we demonstrate at the molecular level how this scenario is realized in an important class of semiconductor glasses, namely chalcogen and pnictogen containing alloys. Both the glass itself and the intrinsic electronic midgap states emerge as a result of the formation of a network composed of $œÉ$-bonded atomic $p$-orbitals that are only weakly hybridized. Despite a large number of weak bonds, these $ppœÉ$-networks are stable with respect to competing types of bonding, while exhibiting a high degree of structural degeneracy. The stability is rationalized with the help of a hereby proposed structural model, by which $ppœÉ$-networks are symmetry-broken and distorted versions of a high symmetry structure. The latter structure exhibits exact octahedral coordination and is fully covalently-bonded. The present approach provides a microscopic route to a fully consistent description of the electronic and structural excitations in vitreous semiconductors.</p>

    <p>The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a new ferrimagnetic decorated spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg chain with spin-1 pendant spins are investigated for three cases: (A) J1,J2>0; (B) J1>0, J2<0; and (C) J1<0, J2>0, where J1 and J2 are the exchange couplings between spins in the chain and along the rung, respectively. The low-lying and magnetic properties are explored jointly by the real-space renormalization group, spin wave, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, while the transfer-matrix renormalization group method is invoked to study the thermodynamics. It is found that the magnon spectra consist of a gapless and two gapped branches. Two branches in case (C) have intersections. The coupling dependence of low-energy gaps are analyzed. In a magnetic field, an m=3/2 (m is the magnetization per unit cell) plateau is observed for case (A), while two plateaux at m=1/2 and 3/2 are observed for cases (B) and (C). Between the two plateaux in cases (B) and (C), the sublattice magnetizations for the spins coupled by ferromagnetic interactions have novel decreasing regions with increasing the magnetic field. At finite temperature, the zero-field susceptibility temperature product chi*T and specific heat exhibit distinct exotic features with varying the couplings and temperature for different cases. chi*T is found to converge as T approaches zero, which is different from the divergent behavior in the spin-(1/2,1) mixed-spin chain without pendants. The observed thermodynamic behaviors are also discussed with the help of their low-lying excitations.</p>

    <p>The separation of micron-sized bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus) from a steady flow of water through the use of ultrasonic standing waves is demonstrated. An ultrasonic resonator with cross-section of 0.0254 m x 0.0254 m has been designed with a flow inlet and outlet for a water stream that ensures laminar flow conditions into and out of the resonator section of the flow tube. A 0.01905-m diameter PZT-4, nominal 2-MHz transducer is used to generate ultrasonic standing waves in the resonator. The acoustic resonator is 0.0356 m from transducer face to the opposite reflector wall with the acoustic field in a direction orthogonal to the water flow direction. At fixed frequency excitation, spores are concentrated at the stable locations of the acoustic radiation force and trapped in the resonator region. The effect of the transducer voltage and frequency on the efficiency of spore capture in the resonator has been investigated. Successful separation of B. cereus spores from water with typical volume flow rates of 40-250 ml/min has been achieved with 15% efficiency in a single pass at 40 ml/min.</p>

    <p>Double-exchange mechanisms in RE$_{1-x}$AE$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ manganites (where RE is a trivalent rare-earth ion and AE is a divalent alkali-earth ion) relies on the strong exchange interaction between two Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ ions through interfiling oxygen 2p states. Nevertheless, the role of RE and AE ions has ever been considered "silent" with respect to the DE conducting mechanisms. Here we show that a new path for DE-mechanism is indeed possible by partially replacing the RE-AE elements by Mn$^{2+}$-ions, in La-deficient La$_{x}$MnO$_{3-Œ¥}$ thin films. X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the relevant presence of Mn$^{2+}$ ions, which is unambiguously proved to be substituted at La-site by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering. Mn$^{2+}$ is proved to be directly correlated to the enhanced magneto-transport properties because of an additional hopping mechanism trough interfiling Mn$^{2+}$-ions, theoretically confirmed by calculations within the effective single band model. The very idea to use Mn$^{2+}$ both as a doping element and an ions electronically involved in the conduction mechanism, has never been foreseen, revealing a new phenomena in transport properties of manganites. More important, such a strategy might be also pursed in other strongly correlated materials.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Low dimensional materials provide the possibility of improved thermoelectric performance due to the additional length scale degree of freedom for engineering their electronic and thermal properties. As a result of suppressed phonon conduction, large improvements on the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, have been recently reported in nanostructures, compared to the raw materials' ZT values. In addition, low dimensionality can improve a device's power factor, offering an additional enhancement in ZT. In this work the atomistic sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled tight-binding model is used to calculate the electronic structure of silicon nanowires (NWs). The Landauer formalism is applied to calculate an upper limit for the electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the power factor. We examine n-type and p-type nanowires of diameters from 3nm to 12nm, in [100], [110], and [111] transport orientations at different doping concentrations. Using experimental values for the lattice thermal conductivity in nanowires, an upper limit for ZT is computed. We find that at room temperature, scaling the diameter below 7nm can at most double the power factor and enhance ZT. In some cases, however, scaling does not enhance the performance at all. Orientations, geometries, and subband engineering techniques for optimized designs are discussed.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The surprising discovery of superconductivity in layered iron-based materials, with transition temperatures climbing as high as 55 K, has lead to thousands of publications on this subject over the past two years. While there is general consensus on the unconventional nature of the Cooper pairing state of these systems, several central questions remain - including the role of magnetism, the nature of chemical and structural tuning, and the resultant pairing symmetry - and the search for universal properties and principles continues. Here we review the progress of research on iron-based superconducting materials, highlighting the major experimental benchmarks that have been so far reached and the important questions that remain to be conclusively answered.</p>

    <p>In inversion asymmetric semiconductors, spin-orbit interactions give rise to very effective relaxation mechanisms of the electron spin. Recent work, based on the dimensionally constrained D'yakonov Perel' mechanism, describes increasing electron-spin relaxation times for two-dimensional conducting layers with decreasing channel width. The slow-down of the spin relaxation can be understood as a precursor of the one-dimensional limit.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The dynamics of flexible polymer molecules are often assumed to be governed by hydrodynamics of the solvent. However there is considerable evidence that internal dissipation of a polymer contributes as well. Here we investigate the dynamics of a single chain in the absence of solvent to characterize the nature of this internal friction. We model the chains as freely hinged but with localized bond angles and 3-fold symmetric dihedral angles. We show that the damping is close but not identical to Kelvin damping, which depends on the first temporal and second spatial derivative of monomer position. With no internal potential between monomers, the magnitude of the damping is small for long wavelengths and weakly damped oscillatory time dependent behavior is seen for a large range of spatial modes. When the size of the internal potential is increased, such oscillations persist, but the damping becomes larger. However underdamped motion is present even with quite strong dihedral barriers for long enough wavelengths.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Trigonal zigzag graphene nanodisk exhibits magnetism whose spin is proportional to the edge length of the nanodisk. Its spin can be designed from 1/2 to a huge value. The spins form a quasiferromagnet, which has intermediate properties between a single spin and a ferromagnet. In other words, the ferromagnet order has a relatively long life time, and yet the nanodisk spin can be rotated by external field or current. We consider a nanodisk connected with two leads. This system acts as a spin filter just as in a metal-ferromagnet-metal junction. In this way we can generate a spin current. Furthermore we can manipulate spin current by spin valve, spin switch and other spintronic devices made of graphene nanodisks. We also show that nanodisk spins are robust against the effect of randomness in site energy, transfer energy and lattice defects.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have studied the electronic structure of hexagonal MnAs, as epitaxial continuous film on GaAs(001) and as nanocrystals embedded in GaAs, by Mn 2p core-level photoemission spectroscopy. Configuration-interaction analyses based on a cluster model show that the ground state of the embedded MnAs nanocrystals is dominated by a d5 configuration that maximizes the local Mn moment. Nanoscaling and strain significantly alter the properties of MnAs. Internal strain in the nanocrystals results in reduced p-d hybridization and enhanced ionic character of the Mn-As bonding interactions. The spatial confinement and reduced p-d hybridization in the nanocrystals lead to enhanced d-electron localization, triggering d-d electron correlations and enhancing local Mn moments. These changes in the electronic structure of MnAs have an advantageous effect on the Curie temperature of the nanocrystals, which is measured to be remarkably higher than that of bulk MnAs.</p>

    <p>The dynamics of photocarriers in reduced graphene oxide thin films is studied by using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy.  Time dependent differential transmissions are measured with sample temperatures ranging from 9 to 300 K. At each sample temperature and probe delay, the sign of differential transmission remains positive. A fast energy relaxation of hot carriers is observed, and is found to be independent of sample temperature. Our experiments show that the carrier dynamics in reduced graphene oxide is similar to other types of graphene, and that the differential transmission is caused by phase-state filling of carriers.</p>

    <p>Based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a new charging method that should be capable of charging a Lithium-ion battery in a fraction of the time needed when using traditional methods. This charging method uses an additional applied oscillatory electric field. Our simulation results show that this charging method offers a great reduction in the average intercalation time for Li+ ions, which dominates the charging time. The oscillating field not only increases the diffusion rate of Li+ ions in the electrolyte but, more importantly, also enhances intercalation by lowering the corresponding overall energy barrier.</p>

    <p>Fundamental topological phenomena in condensed matter physics are associated with a quantized electromagnetic response in units of fundamental constants. Recently, it has been predicted theoretically that the time-reversal invariant topological insulator in three dimensions exhibits a topological magnetoelectric effect quantized in units of the fine structure constant $Œ±=e^2/\hbar c$. In this work, we propose an optical experiment to directly measure this topological quantization phenomenon, independent of material details. Our proposal also provides a way to measure the half-quantized Hall conductances on the two surfaces of the topological insulator independently of each other.</p>

    <p>Anomalous behaviour of the excess entropy ($S_e$) and the associated scaling relationship with diffusivity are compared in liquids with very different underlying interactions but similar water-like  anomalies: water (SPC/E and TIP3P models), tetrahedral ionic melts (SiO$_2$ and BeF$_2$) and a fluid with core-softened, two-scale ramp (2SRP) interactions. We demonstrate the presence of an excess entropy anomaly in the two water models.  Using length and energy scales appropriate for onset of anomalous behaviour, the density range of the excess entropy anomaly is shown to be much narrower in water than in ionic melts or the 2SRP fluid. While the  reduced  diffusivities ($D^*$) conform to the excess entropy scaling relation, $D^* =A\exp (Œ±S_e)$ for all the systems (Y. Rosenfeld, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 1977}, {\it 15}, 2545), the exponential scaling parameter, $Œ±$, shows a small isochore-dependence in the case of water. Replacing $S_e$ by pair correlation-based approximants accentuates the isochore-dependence of the diffusivity scaling. Isochores with similar diffusivity scaling parameters  are shown to have the temperature dependence of the corresponding entropic contribution. The relationship between diffusivity, excess entropy and pair correlation approximants to the excess entropy are very similar in all the tetrahedral liquids.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The link between the energy surface of bulk systems and their dynamical properties is generally difficult to establish. Using the activation-relaxation technique (ART nouveau), we follow the change in the barrier distribution of a model of amorphous silicon as a function of the degree of relaxation. We find that while the barrier-height distribution, calculated from the initial minimum, is a unique function that depends only on the level of distribution, the reverse-barrier height distribution, calculated from the final state, is independent of the relaxation, following a different  function. Moreover, the resulting gained or released energy distribution is a simple convolution of these two distributions indicating that the activation and relaxation parts of a the elementary relaxation mechanism are completely independent. This characterized energy landscape can be used to explain nano-calorimetry measurements.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a detailed analysis of resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) from Fe$_{1.087}$Te with unprecedented energy resolution. In contrast to the sharp peaks typically seen in insulating systems at the transition metal $L_3$ edge, we observe spectra which show different characteristic features. For low energy transfer, we experimentally observe theoretically predicted many-body effects of resonant Raman scattering from a non-interacting gas of fermions. Furthermore, we find that limitations to this many-body electron-only theory are realized at high Raman shift, where an exponential lineshape reveals an energy scale not present in these considerations. This regime, identified as emission, requires considerations of lattice degrees of freedom to understand the lineshape. We argue that both observations are intrinsic general features of many-body physics of metals.</p>

Despite intense theoretical activity, this fundamental issue has eluded an explanation so far.

We show the first conclusive evidence of the dominant role on the minimal conductivity of charged impurities over ripples, which have no visible effect. Furthermore, in combination with the logarithmic scaling law for diffusive metallic graphene, we ellucidate the origin of the ubiquitously observed minimal conductivity in the range $8e^2/h > œÉ_0 \gtrsim 4e^2/h$.</p>

    <p>Dislocation assemblies exhibit a jamming or yielding transition at a critical external shear stress value $œÉ=œÉ_c$. Nevertheless the nature of this transition has not been ascertained. Here we study the heterogeneous and collective nature of dislocation dynamics within a crystal plasticity model close to $œÉ_c$, by considering the first-passage properties of the dislocation dynamics. As the transition is approached in the moving phase, the first passage time distribution exhibits scaling, and a related peak {\it dynamical} susceptibility $œá_4^*$ diverges as $œá_4^* \sim (œÉ-œÉ_c)^{-Œ±}$, with $Œ±\approx 1.1$. We relate this scaling to an avalanche description of the dynamics. While the static structural correlations are found to be independent of the external stress, we identify a diverging dynamical correlation length $Œæ_y$ in the direction perpendicular to the dislocation glide motion.</p>

The bandstructure has been calculated using 10-orbital $sp^3d^5s^*$ tight-binding method. A number of intrinsic properties including band gap, density of states, intrinsic carrier concentration and parabolic effective mass have been derived from the calculated bandstructure. The spatial distributions of intrinsic carrier concentration and $<100>$ effective mass, arising from the wavefunction of different contributing subbands are analyzed. A self-consistent solution of Poisson-Schrodinger coupled equation is obtained taking the full bandstructure into account, which is then applied to an insightful analysis of volume inversion. The spatial distribution of carriers over the channel of a DGFET has been calculated and its effects on effective mass and channel capacitance are discussed.</p>

This is also a rich domain for fundamental discoveries at the intersection of electron, lattice (phonon), and optical (photon) interactions. This review presents recent progress in understanding and manipulation of energy dissipation and transport in nanoscale solid-state structures. First, the landscape of power usage from nanoscale transistors (~10^-8 W) to massive data centers (~10^9 W) is surveyed. Then, focus is given to energy dissipation in nanoscale circuits, silicon transistors, carbon nanostructures, and semiconductor nanowires. Concepts of steady-state and transient thermal transport are also reviewed in the context of nanoscale devices with sub-nanosecond switching times. Finally, recent directions regarding energy transport are reviewed, including electrical and thermal conductivity of nanostructures, thermal rectification, and the role of ubiquitous material interfaces.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We study the velocity dependence of the frictional force of the tip of an atomic force microscope as it is dragged across a surface, taking into account memory effects and thermal fluctuations. Memory effects are described by a coupling of the tip to low frequency excitation modes of the surface in addition to the coupling to the periodic corrugation potential. We find that when the excitation mode frequency is comparable to the characteristic frequency corresponding to the motion of the tip across the  surface, the velocity dependence of the frictional force is non monotonic, displaying a velocity range where the frictional force can decrease with increasing velocity. These results provide theoretical support for the interpretation of recent experiments which find a frictional force that decreases with velocity on surfaces covered with a monolayer.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Intra and intersubband scattering rates and electron capture rates are considered when mediated by hybrid optical phonons in an AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double heterostructure confined between two outer metallic barriers. In evaluating scattering rates we concentrate first on an infinite quantum well for the electrons and show that the presence of the outer metal barriers results in reductions of the intra and intersubband scattering rates due to the suppression of the interface-like modes. For a quantum well (QW) with a finite depth we find that the outer barriers are responsible for the existence of a discrete energy spectrum above the well. The electron capture process under these circumstances is defined as the electron transition from the first electron subband above the well to all possible subbands inside the well by the emission of hybrid phonons. Explicit calculations reveal that the capture rates are characterized by sharp peaks, referred to as electron resonances which arise when a new electron state is generated on increasing the quantum well width. Other sharp peaks are identified as phonon resonances and arise when the energy of the initial state differs by a phonon energy from an electron state at the bottom of a quantum well subband.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A generic theory of the quasi-particle superconducting gap in underdoped cuprates is derived in the strong coupling limit, and found to describe extremely well the experimental "second gap" in \textit{absolute scale}.  In drastic contrast to the standard theories of Bogoliubov quasi-particle excitations, the quasi-particle gap is shown to originate from anomalous kinetic process, completely unrelated to the pairing strength.  Furthermore, the $k$-dependence of the gap deviates significantly from the pure $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave of the order parameter.  Our study reveals a new paradigm for the nature of superconducting gap, and is expected to reconcile numerous apparent contradictions among existing experiments toward a more coherent understanding of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Despite more than two decades of intensive investigations, the true nature of high temperature (high-$T_c$) superconductivity observed in the cuprates remains elusive to the researchers.  In particular, in the so-called `underdoped' region, the overall behavior of superconductivity deviates $qualitatively$ from the standard theoretical description pioneered by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS).  Recently, the importance of phase fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter has gained significant support from various experiments.  However, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the surprisingly soft phase remains one of the most important unsolved puzzles.  Here, opposite to the standard BCS starting point, we propose a simple, solvable low-energy model in the strong coupling limit, which maps the superconductivity literally into a well-understood physics of superfluid in a special dilute bosonic system of local pairs of doped holes.  In the prototypical material (La$_{1-Œ¥}$Sr$_Œ¥$)$_2$CuO$_4$, without use of any free parameter, a $d$-wave superconductivity is obtained for doping above $\sim 5.2\%$, below which unexpected incoherent $p$-wave pairs dominate.  Throughout the whole underdoped region, very soft phases are found to originate from enormous mass enhancement of the pairs.  Furthermore, a striking mass divergence is predicted that dictates the occurrence of the observed quantum critical point.  Our model produces properties of the superfluid in good agreement with the experiments, and provides new insights into several current puzzles.  Owing to its simplicity, this model offers a paradigm of great value in answering the long-standing challenges in underdoped cuprates.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present a detailed study on the magnetic properties, including anisotropy, reversal fields, and magnetization reversal processes, of well characterized half-metallic epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) thin films grown onto SrTiO3 (STO) substrates with three different surface orientations, i.e. (001), (110) and (1-18). The latter shows step edges oriented parallel to the [110] (in-plane) crystallographic direction. Room temperature high resolution vectorial Kerr magnetometry measurements have been performed at different applied magnetic field directions in the whole angular range. In general, the magnetic properties of the LSMO films can be interpreted with just the uniaxial term with the anisotropy axis given by the film morphology, whereas the strength of this anisotropy depends on both structure and film thickness. In particular, LSMO films grown on nominally flat (110)-oriented STO substrates presents a well defined uniaxial anisotropy originated from the existence of elongated in-plane [001]-oriented structures, whereas LSMO films grown on nominally flat (001)-oriented STO substrates show a weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis direction aligned parallel to residual substrate step edges. Elongated structures are also found for LSMO films grown on vicinal STO(001) substrates. These films present a well-defined uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis lying along the step edges and its strength increases with the LSMO thickness. It is remarkable that this step-induced uniaxial anisotropy has been found for LSMO films up to 120 nm thickness. Our results are promising for engineering novel half-metallic magnetic devices that exploit tailored magnetic anisotropy.</p>

    <p>We enumerate all minimal energy packings (MEPs) for small single linear and ring polymers composed of spherical monomers with contact attractions and hard-core repulsions, and compare them to corresponding results for monomer packings. We define and identify ``dividing surfaces" in polymer packings, which reduce the number of arrangements that satisfy hard-sphere and covalent bond constraints. Compared to monomer MEPs, polymer MEPs favor intermediate structural symmetry over high and low symmetries. We also examine the packing-preparation dependence for longer single chains using molecular dynamics simulations. For slow temperature quenches, chains form crystallites with close-packed cores. As quench rate increases, the core size decreases and the exterior becomes more disordered. By examining the contact number, we connect suppression of crystallization to the onset of isostaticity in disordered packings. These studies represent a significant step forward in our ability to predict how the structural and mechanical properties of compact polymers depend on collapse dynamics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The dispersion energy between extended molecular chains (or equivalently infinite wires) with non-zero band gaps is generally assumed to be expressible as a pair-wise sum of atom-atom terms which decay as $R^{-6}$. Using a model system of two parallel wires with a variable band gap, we show that this is not the case. The dispersion interaction scales as $z^{-5}$ for large interwire separations $z$, as expected for an insulator, but as the band gap decreases the interaction is greatly enhanced; while at shorter (but non-overlapping) separations it approaches a power-law scaling given by $z^{-2}$, \emph{i.e.} the dispersion interaction expected between \emph{metallic} wires. We demonstrate that these effects can be understood from the increasing length scale of the plasmon modes (charge fluctuations), and their increasing contribution to the molecular dipole polarizability and the dispersion interaction, as the band gaps are reduced. This result calls into question methods which invoke locality assumptions in deriving dispersion interactions between extended small-gap systems.</p>

    <p>A coarse grained model for flexible polymers end-grafted to repulsive spherical nanoparticles is studied for various chain lengths and grafting densities under good solvent conditions, by Molecular Dynamics methods and density functional theory. With increasing chain length the monomer density profile exhibits a crossover to the star polymer limit. The distribution of polymer ends and the linear dimensions of individual polymer chains are obtained, while the inhomogeneous stretching of the chains is characterized by the local persistence lengths. The results on the structure factor of both single chain and full spherical brush as well as the range of applicability of the different theoretical tools are presented.

    <p>We investigate the role of surface plasmons in the electromagnetic Casimir effect at finite temperature, including situations out of global thermal equilibrium. The free energy is calculated analytically and expanded for different regimes of distances and temperatures. Similar to the zero-temperature case, the interaction changes from attraction to repulsion with distance. Thermal effects are shown to be negligible for small plate separations and at room temperature, but become dominant and repulsive at large values of these parameters. In configurations out of global thermal equilibrium, we show that the selective excitation of surface plasmons can create a repulsive Casimir force between metal plates.</p>

A simple physical model, taking into account the basic physics of current rectification, can adequately describe the single-tube and array devices. We show that for as grown array diodes, the rectification ratio, defined by the maximum-to-minimum-current-ratio, is low due to the presence of m-SWNT shunts. These tubes can be eliminated in a single voltage sweep resulting in a high rectification array device. Further analysis also shows that the channel resistance, and not the intrinsic nanotube diode properties, limits the rectification in devices with channel length up to ten micrometer.</p>

    <p>The linked cell list algorithm is an essential part of molecular simulation software, both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo. Though it scales linearly with the number of particles, there has been a constant interest in increasing its efficiency, because a large part of CPU time is spent to identify the interacting particles. Several recent publications proposed improvements to the algorithm and investigated their efficiency by applying them to particular setups. In this publication we develop a general method to evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms, which is mostly independent of the parameters of the simulation, and test it for a number of linked cell list algorithms. We also propose a combination of linked cell reordering and interaction sorting that shows a good efficiency for a broad range of simulation setups.</p>

    <p>We have demonstrated the effect of pressure on magnetization jump and its associated magnetostriction in Eu$_{0.58}$Sr$_{0.42}$MnO$_{3}$. The critical field lowered by the applied pressure is explained by a suppression of the metastable blocked state, which is inherent to the phase separated manganite system exhibiting the magnetic avalanche. To reduce a factor of the bad thermal coupling in the bulk sample, and to further examine the nature of the magnetization jump, we have performed the influence of pressure on the isothermal magnetization of the powder sample. There is no discrepancy in the critical field between the bulk and powder samples although the $MH$ curve of the latter is not saturated at high fields. These findings indicate a crucial role of the frozen phase separated state in the abrupt transition.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The tunnel photocurrent between a gold surface and a free-standing semiconducting thin film excited from the rear by above bandgap light has been measured as a function of applied bias, tunnel distance and excitation light power. The results are compared with the predictions of a model which includes the bias dependence of the tunnel barrier height and the bias-induced decrease of surface recombination velocity. It is found that i) the tunnel photocurrent from the conduction band dominates that from surface states. ii) At large tunnel distance the exponential bias dependence of the current is explained by that of the tunnel barrier height, while at small distance the change of surface recombination velocity is dominant.</p>

    <p>We present theory and experiments for the force-distance curve $F(z_0)$ of an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip (radius $R$) indenting a supported fluid bilayer (thickness $2d$). For realistic conditions the force is dominated by the area compressibility modulus $Œ∫_A$ of the bilayer, and, to an excellent approximation, given by $F= œÄŒ∫_A R z_0^2/(2d-z_0)^2$. The experimental AFM force curves from coexisting liquid ordered and liquid disordered domains in 3-component lipid bilayers are well-described by our model, and provides $Œ∫_A$ in agreement with literature values. The liquid ordered phase has a yield like response that we model by hydrogen bond breaking.</p>

    <p>The solid solution Ga1-xGexV4S8 (x = 0 - 1) was synthesized by solid state reactions and characterized by temperature-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and static magnetic susceptibility measurements. The compounds crystallize in the cubic GaMo4S8-type structure (space group F-43m), built up by heterocubane-like [V4S4](5-x)+ cubes and [Ga1-xGexS4](5-x)- tetrahedra arranged in a NaCl-like manner. The successive substitution of Ga3+ by Ge4+ increases the electron count in the molecular orbital (MO) of the V4-cluster gradually from seven to eight. We observe an almost linear increase of the magnetic moments, connected with a transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering around x <= 0.5. Remarkably, the low temperature structural phase transitions as known from the ternary compounds were also detected in the solid solution. The gallium-rich compounds (0 < x < 0.5) undergo rhombohedral distortions like GaV4S8 (space group R3m), whereas distortions to orthorhombic symmetry (space group Imm2) as known from GeV4S8 occur in the germanium-rich part of the solid solution (0.5 <= x < 1).</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Upon cooling, branched line defects develop in epitaxial graphene grown at high temperature on Pt(111) and Ir(111). Using atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy we demonstrate that these defects are wrinkles in the graphene layer, i.e. stripes of partially delaminated graphene. With low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) we investigate the wrinkling phenomenon in situ. Upon temperature cycling we observe hysteresis in the appearance and disappearance of the wrinkles. Simultaneously with wrinkle formation a change in bright field imaging intensity of adjacent areas and a shift in the moire spot positions for micro diffraction of such areas takes place. The stress relieved by wrinkle formation results from the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of graphene and the substrate. A simple one-dimensional model taking into account the energies related to strain, delamination and bending of graphene is in qualitative agreement with our observations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Here a recently observed weak first order transition in doped SrTiO3 is argued to be a consequence of the coupling between strain and order parameter fluctuations. Starting with a semi-microscopic action, and using renormalization group equations for vertices, we write the free energy of such a system. This fluctuation renormalized free energy is then used to discuss the possibility of first order transition at zero temperature as well as at finite temperature. An asymptotic analysis predicts small but a finite discontinuity in the order parameter near a mean field quantum critical point at zero temperature. In case of finite temperature transition, near quantum critical point such a possibility is found to be extremely weak. Results are in accord with some experimental findings on quantum paraelectrics such as SrTiO3 and KTaO3.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Unlike charge and spin, the orbital degree of freedom of electrons in transition metal oxides is difficult to detect. We present the theoretical study of a new detection method in metallic orbitally active systems by analyzing the quasiparticle scattering interference (QPI) pattern of the spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling spectroscopy, which is sensitive to orbital structures and orbital ordering. The QPIs for the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$-orbital bands in the $t_{2g}$-orbital systems show a characteristic stripe-like feature as a consequence of their quasi-one-dimensional nature, which is robust against orbital hybridization. With the occurrence of orbital ordering proposed in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and iron-pnictides, the stripe-like QPI patterns exhibit nematic distortion breaking the $C_4$-symmetry.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Starting from the multiorbital Hubbard model for the t2g-bands of RTiO3 (R= Y, Gd, Sm, and La), where all parameters have been derived from the first-principles calculations, we construct an effective superexchange (SE) spin model, by treating transfer integrals as a perturbation. We consider four approximations for the SE interactions: (i) the canonical crystal-field (CF) theory, where the form of the the occupied t2g-orbitals is dictated by the CF splitting, and three extensions, namely (ii) the relativistic one, where occupied orbitals are confined within the lowest Kramers doublet obtained from the diagonalization of the crystal field and relativistic spin-orbit (SO) interactions; (iii) the finite-temperature extension, which consider the effect of thermal orbital fluctuations near the CF configuration; (iv) the many-electron extension, which is based on the diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian constructed in the basis of two-electron states separately for each bond of the system. The main results are summarized as follows. (i) Thermal fluctuations of the orbital degrees of freedom can substantially reduce the value of the magnetic transition temperature. (ii) The anisotropic and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions are rigorously derived and their implications to the magnetic properties are discussed. (iii) The CF theory, although applicable for YTiO3 and high-temperature structures of GdTiO3 and SmTiO3, breaks down in LaTiO3. Instead, the combination of the many-electron effects and SO interaction can be responsible for the AFM character of interatomic correlations in LaTiO3. (iv) The SE interactions in YTiO3 strongly depend on the details of the crystal structure. Distortions in the low-temperature structure tend to weaken the ferromagnetic interactions.</p>

    <p>The spatial distribution of structural relaxation in a supercooled liquid is studied using molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D binary mixture. It is shown that the spatial heterogeneity of the relaxation along with the time scale of the relaxation is determined, not by the frequency with which particles move a distance pi/2kBragg, but by the frequency with which particles can achieve persistent displacements. We show that these persistent displacements are achieved through the coupled action of local reorganizations and unrecoverable thermal strains.</p>

This results from a change in the polarization state of the semiconductor, which is consistent with a free electron-hole creation/recombination process.

    <p>Spontaneous emission (SE) from a two-level atom in a photonic crystal (PC) with anisotropic one-band model is investigated using the fractional calculus. Analytically solving the kinetic equation in terms of the fractional exponential function, the dynamical discrepancy of SE between the anisotropic and isotropic systems is discussed on the basis of different photon density of states (DOS) and the existence of incoherent diffusion field that becomes even more clearly as the atomic transition frequency lies close to the band edge. With the same atom-field coupling strength and detuning in the forbidden gap, the photon-atom bound states in the isotropic system turn into the unbound ones in the anisotropic system that is consistent with the experimental observation in $Phys.$ $Rev.$ $Lett.$ \textbf{96}, 243902 (2006). Dynamics along different wavevectors with various curvatures of dispersion is also addressed with the changes of the photon DOS and the appearance of the diffusion fields.</p>

    <p>We use spin torque ferromagnetic resonance to measure the spectral properties of dipole-exchange spin waves in permalloy nanowires. Our measurements reveal that geometric confinement has a profound effect on the damping of spin waves in the nanowire geometry. The damping parameter of the lowest-energy quantized spin wave mode depends on applied magnetic field in a resonant way and exhibits a maximum at a field that increases with decreasing nanowire width. This enhancement of damping originates from a nonlinear resonant three-magnon confluence process allowed at a particular bias field value determined by quantization of the spin wave spectrum in the nanowire geometry.</p>

The soft-repulsive component of the potential is being varied so as to study the effect on reentrant melting and density anomaly. Upon increasing the repulsion softness, we find that the anomalous melting features persist and occur at smaller pressures. Moreover, if we reduce the range of downward concavity in the potential by extending the hard core at the expenses of the soft-repulsive shoulder, the reentrant part of the melting line reduces in extent so as it does the region of density anomaly.</p>

We show that for weakly coupled semiconducting grains the figure of merit is optimized for grain sizes of order 5nm for typical materials and its values can be larger than one.

    <p>Thermal-magnetic noise at ferromagnetic resonance (T-FMR) can be used to measure magnetic perpendicular anisotropy of nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). For this purpose, T-FMR measurements were conducted with an external magnetic field up to 14 kOe applied perpendicular to the film surface of MgO-based MTJs under a dc bias. The observed frequency-field relationship suggests that a 20 A CoFeB free layer has an effective demagnetization field much smaller than the intrinsic bulk value of CoFeB, with 4PiMeff = (6.1 +/- 0.3) kOe. This value is consistent with the saturation field obtained from magnetometry measurements on extended films of the same CoFeB thickness. In-plane T-FMR on the other hand shows less consistent results for the effective demagnetization field, presumably due to excitations of more complex modes. These experiments suggest that the perpendicular T-FMR is preferred for quantitative magnetic characterization of nanoscale MTJs.</p>

This transport technique is the analogue of magnetic susceptibility measurements of bulk material but is applicable to very small samples with low total moment. The technique is used to characterize devices fabricated from the dilute magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. The technique allows us to probe the behavior of the parameters close to the Curie temperature, in the limit of the applied magnetic field tending to zero. This avoids the complications arising from the presence of paramagnetism.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>By using the density functional theory method, we systematically study the influences of the doping of an Al atom on the electronic structures of the Mg(0001) surface and dissociation behaviors of H2 molecules. We find that for the Al-doped surfaces, the surface relaxation around the doping layer changes from expansion of a clean Mg(0001) surface to contraction, due to the redistribution of electrons. After doping, the work function is enlarged, and the electronic states around the Fermi energy have a major distribution around the doping layer. For the dissociation of H2 molecules, we find that the energy barrier is enlarged for the doped surfaces. Especially, when the Al atom is doped at the first layer, the energy barrier is enlarged by 0.30 eV. For different doping lengths, however, the dissociation energy barrier decreases slowly to the value on a clean Mg(0001) surface when the doping layer is far away from the top surface. Our results well describe the electronic changes after Al-doping for the Mg(0001) surface, and reveal some possible mechanisms for improving the resistance to corrosion of the Mg(0001) surface by doping of Al atoms.</p>

    <p>An effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ which differs from the bath temperature is believed to play an essential role in the theory of elasto-plasticity of amorphous solids. The definition of a measurable $T_{\rm eff}$ in the literature on sheared solids suffers however from being connected to a fluctuation-dissipation theorem which is correct only in equilibrium. Here we introduce a natural definition of $T_{\rm eff}$ based on measurable structural features without recourse to any questionable assumption. The value of $T_{\rm eff}$ is connected, using theory and scaling concepts, to the flow stress and the mean energy that characterize the elasto-plastic flow.</p>

    <p>We explore multi-terminal quantum transport through a benzene molecule threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux $œÜ$. A simple tight-binding model is used to describe the system and all the calculations are done based on the Green's function formalism. With a brief description of two-terminal quantum transport, we present a detailed study of three-terminal transport properties through the benzene molecule to reveal the actual mechanism of electron transport. Here we numerically compute the multi-terminal conductances, reflection probabilities and current-voltage characteristics in the aspects of molecular coupling strength and magnetic flux $œÜ$. Most significantly we observe that, the molecular system where the benzene molecule is attached to three terminals can be operated as a transistor, and we call it a molecular transistor. This aspect can be utilized in designing nano-electronic circuits and our investigation may provide a basic framework to study electron transport in any complicated multi-terminal quantum system.</p>

We find that the internal quantum efficiency of such a device, if we choose an appropriate narrow-gap Mott insulator, can be significantly enhanced due to impact ionization caused by the photoexcited ``hot'' electron/hole pairs. Namely, the photoexcited electron and/or hole can convert its excess energy beyond the Mott-Hubbard gap to additional electrical energy by creating multiple electron/hole pairs in a time scale which can be shorter than the time characterizing other relaxation processes.</p>

    <p>Time-and-frequency resolved pump-probe optical spectroscopy is used to investigate the effect of the impulsive injection of delocalized excitations through a charge-transfer process in insulating CuGeO3. A large broadening of the charge-transfer edge is observed on the sub-ps timescale. The modification of this spectral feature can not be attributed to the local increase of the effective temperature, as a consequence of the energy absorbed by the pump pulse. The measured modifications of the optical properties of the system are consistent with the creation of a non-thermal state, metastable on the ps timescale, after the pump-induced impulsive modification of the electron interactions.</p>

    <p>Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 superconducting thin films have been grown on SrTiO3, (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3, LaAlO3 and YAlO3 (YAO) single crystal substrates by pulsed laser deposition. All the films, except on YAO, have been grown epitaxially without buffer layers. The films deposited on YAO contained 45 degree in-plane rotated grains and showed a broad superconducting transition. The onset Tc of the films is observed to increase from 16.2 K to 24.5 K with increasing c/a, mainly due to a slight distortion of the AsFe4 tetrahedron. From this correlation, we expect that higher superconducting transition temperatures than 24.5 K in a strained epitaxial film may be possible.</p>

    <p>Using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we study the relaxation dynamics of hot optical phonons in few-layer and multi-layer graphene films grown by epitaxy on silicon carbide substrates and by chemical vapor deposition on nickel substrates. In the first few hundred femtoseconds after photoexcitation, the hot carriers lose most of their energy to the generation of hot optical phonons which then present the main bottleneck to subsequent carrier cooling. Optical phonon cooling on short time scales is found to be independent of the graphene growth technique, the number of layers, and the type of the substrate. We find average phonon lifetimes in the 2.5-2.55 ps range. We model the relaxation dynamics of the coupled carrier-phonon system with rate equations and find a good agreement between the experimental data and the theory. The extracted optical phonon lifetimes agree very well with the theory based on anharmonic phonon interactions.</p>

    <p>Photonic and optoelectronic devices may offer the opportunity to realize efficient signal processing at speeds higher than in conventional electronic devices. Switches form the building blocks for circuits and fast photonic switches have been realized [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Recently, proof of principle of exciton optoelectronic devices was demonstrated [7,8]. Potential advantages of excitonic devices include high operation and interconnection speed, small dimensions, and the opportunity to combine many elements into integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate experimental proof of principle for the operation of excitonic switching devices at temperatures around 100 K. The devices are based on an AlAs/GaAs coupled quantum well structure and include the exciton optoelectronic transistor (EXOT), the excitonic bridge modulator (EXBM), and the excitonic pinch-off modulator (EXPOM). This is a two orders of magnitude increase in the operation temperature compared to the earlier devices, where operation was demonstrated at 1.5 K [7,8].</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A zigzag graphene nanodisk can be interpreted as a quantum dot with an internal degree of freedom. It is well described by the infinite-range Heisenberg model. We have investigated its thermodynamical properties. There exists a quasi-phase transition between the quasi-ferromagnet and quasi-paramagnet states, as signaled by a sharp peak in the specific heat and in the susceptability. We have also analyzed how thermodynamical properties are affected when two leads are attached to the nanodisk. It is shown that lead effects are described by the many-spin Kondo Hamiltonian. There appears a new peak in the specific heat, and the multiplicity of the ground state becomes just one half of the system without leads. Another lead effect is to enhance the ferromagnetic order. Being a ferromagnet, a nanodisk can be used as a spin filter. Furthermore, since the relaxation time is finite, it is possible to control the spin of the nanodisk by an external spin current. We then propose a rich variety of spintronic devices made of nanodisks and leads, such as spin memory, spin amplifier, spin valve, spin-field-effect transistor, spin diode and spin logic gates such as spin-XNOR gate and spin-XOR gate. Graphene nanodisks could well be basic components of future nanoelectronic and spintronic devices.</p>

    <p>We present ion beam erosion experiments performed in ultra high vacuum using a differentially pumped ion source and taking care that the ion beam hits the Si(001) sample only. Under these conditions no ion beam patterns form on Si for angles below 45 degrees with respect to the global surface normal using 2 keV Kr ions and fluences of 2 x 10^22 ions/m^2. In fact, the ion beam induces a smoothening of preformed patterns. Simultaneous sputter deposition of stainless steel in this angular range creates a variety of patterns, similar to those previously ascribed to clean ion beam induced destabilization of the surface profile. Only for grazing incidence with incident angles between 60 degrees and 83 degrees pronounced ion beam patterns form. It appears that the angular dependent stability of Si(001) against pattern formation under clean ion beam erosion conditions is related to the angular dependence of the sputtering yield, and not primarily to a curvature dependent yield as invoked frequently in continuum theory models.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Correlated materials are extremely sensitive to external stimuli, such as temperature or pressure. Describing the electronic properties of such systems often requires applying many-body techniques to effective low energy problems in the spirit of the Hubbard model, or extensions thereof. While the effect of pressure on structures and bands has been investigated extensively within density-functional based methods, the pressure dependence of electron-electron interactions has so far received little attention. As a step toward ab initio pressure studies for realistic systems within a setup of maximally localized Wannier functions and the constrained random phase approximation, we examine in this paper the paradigmatic pressure dependence of Coulomb interactions. While compression commonly causes the "extension" of Wannier functions, and thus transfer elements, to grow, we find the -- seemingly counter-intuitive -- tendency that the bare Coulomb interaction increases under compression as well. We reconcile these behaviors by appealing to a semi-analytical tight-binding model. We moreover argue that, for this model, the requirement of maximal Wannier localization is equivalent to maximizing the Coulomb interaction matrix elements. We then apply the above first principles techniques to fcc hydrogen under pressure. While we find our comprehension of the bare Coulomb interaction confirmed, the induced changes in screening strengths lead to an effective one band model with a Hubbard interaction that is non-monotonous under pressure.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have performed electrical resistivity measurements of a polycrystalline sample of FeSe$_{0.25}$Te$_{0.75}$, which exhibits superconductivity at $T_{\rm c} \sim 14$ K, in magnetic fields up to 55 T to determine the upper critical field $Œº_{0}H_{\rm c2}$. In this compound, very large slopes of $Œº_{0}H_{\rm c2}$ at the onset, the mid-point, the zero-resistivity temperatures on superconductivity are determined to be -13.7, -10.1, and -6.9 T/K, respectively. The observed $Œº_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T)$s of this compound are considerably smaller than those expected from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, manifesting the Pauli limiting behavior. These results suggest that this compound has a large Maki parameter, but it is smaller than that calculated for a weak-coupling superconductor, indicating a large superconducting gap of this compound as a strong-coupling superconductor.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Films composed of nanotube networks have their conductivities regulated by the junction resistances formed between tubes. Conductivity values are enhanced by lower junction resistances but should reach a maximum that is limited by the network morphology. By considering ideal ballistic-like contacts between nanotubes we use the Kubo formalism to calculate the upper bound for the conductivity of such films and show how it depends on the nanotube concentration as well as on their aspect ratio. Highest measured conductivities reported so far are approaching this limiting value, suggesting that further progress lies with nanowires other than nanotubes.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We performed a systematic study on the properties of CeFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O ($0\leq x\leq 1$) by electrical resistivity, magnetization and specific heat measurements. The c-axis lattice constant decreases significantly with increasing P content, suggesting a remarkable chemical pressure. The Fe-3d electrons show the enhanced metallic behavior upon P-doping and undergo a magnetic quantum phase transition around $x \approx 0.4$. Meanwhile, the Ce-4f electrons develop a ferromagnetic order near the same doping level. The ferromagnetic order is vanishingly small around $x=0.9$. The data suggest a heavy-fermion-like behavior as $x\geq 0.95$. No superconductivity is observed down to 2 K. Our results show the ferromagnetic ordered state as an intermediate phase intruding between the antiferromagnetic bad metal and the nonmagnetic heavy fermion metal and support the cerium-containing iron pnictides as a unique layered Kondo lattice system.</p>

    <p>We study ferroelectricity in thin films of pseudo-proper ferroelectrics such as the so-called spiral multiferroics. We find that this type of ferroelectricity stands better against depolarizing fields than conventional one. Its single-domain state can be easily preserved by metallic electrodes even in ultrathin films. In fact, single-domain ferroelectricty can be generated as a metastable state in the absence of electrodes. We also find a new regime of small thickness where unscreened films develop unusual multi-domain states with properties determined by non-electrostatic boundary conditions.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Deep inelastic neutron scattering experiments using indirect time-of-flight spectrometers have reported a smaller cross section for the hydrogen atom than expected from conventional scattering theory. Typically, at large momentum transfers, a deficit of 20-40% in the neutron scattering intensity has been measured and several theories have been developed to explain these results. We present a different approach to this problem by investigating the hydrogen cross section in polyethylene using the direct geometry time-of-flight spectrometer MARI with the incident energy fixed at a series of values ranging from Ei=0.5 eV to 100 eV. These measurements span a much broader range in momentum than previous studies and with varying energy resolutions. We observe no momentum dependence to the cross section with an error of 4% and through a comparison with the scattering from metal foil standards measure the absolute bound cross section of the hydrogen atom to be sigma(H)= 80 +/- 4 barns. These results are in agreement with conventional scattering theory but contrast with theories invoking quantum entanglement and neutron experiments supporting them. Our results also illustrate a unique use of direct geometry chopper instruments at high incident energies and demonstrate their capability for conducting high-energy spectroscopy.</p>

    <p>The electronic structure of lanthanide and actinide compounds is often characterized by orbital ordering of localized $f$-electrons. Density-functional theory (DFT) studies of such systems using the currently available LDA+$U$ method are plagued by significant orbital-dependent self-interaction, leading to erroneous orbital ground states. An alternative scheme that modifies the exchange, not Hartree, energy is proposed as a remedy. We show that our LDA+$U$ approach reproduces the expected degeneracy of $f^1$ and $f^2$ states in free ions and the correct ground states in solid PrO$_2$. We expect our method to be useful in studying compounds of $f$- and heavy-$d$ elements.</p>

    <p>Magnetic nanoparticles of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) manganite with mean particle sizes of 13, 16, 18 and 21 nm were prepared by the sol-gel method. The crystal structure and mean particle size of the synthesized powders were estimated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using rietveld refinement and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission spectroscopy revealed that stretching and bending modes are influenced by calcinations temperature. Dc magnetization versus magnetic field of the samples was carried out at room temperature. Magnetic dynamics of the samples was studied by the measurement of ac magnetic susceptibility versus temperature at different frequencies and ac magnetic fields. A frequency-dependent peak was observed in ac magnetic susceptibility versus temperature which is well described by Vogel-Fulcher and critical slowing down laws, and empirical and parameters. By fitting the experimental data with Vogel-Fulcher and critical slowing down laws, the relaxation time, characteristic temperature, magnetic anisotropy energy, effective magnetic anisotropy constant and critical exponent zv have been estimated. The obtained values of c1, c2, T0 and t0 from the Vogel-Fulcher law support of the presence of strong interaction between magnetic nanoparticles. The values of zv and t0 obtained from critical slowing down fit suggest the presence of superspin glass behavior in LSMO nanoparticles of different sizes.</p>

    <p>Boron clusters have been widely studied theoretically for their geometrical properties and electronic structure using a variety of methodologies. An important cluster of boron is the B$_{12}$ cluster whose two main isomers have distinct geometries, namely, icosahedral ($I_{h}$) and quasi planar ($C_{3v}$). In this paper we investigate the linear optical absorption spectrum of these two B$_{12}$ structures with the aim of examining the role of geometry on the optical properties of clusters. The optical absorption calculations are performed using both the semi-empirical and the ab initio approaches. The semi-empirical approach uses a wave function methodology employing the INDO model Hamiltonian, coupled with large-scale configuration interaction (CI) calculations, to account for the electron-correlation effects. The \emph{ab initio} calculations are performed within a time-dependent-density-functional-theory (TDDFT) methodology. The results for the two approaches are in very good qualitative agreement with each other. Quantitatively speaking, results agree with each other in the lower energy region, while in the higher energy region, features predicted by the TDDFT approach are red-shifted as compared to the INDO-CI results. Both the approaches predict that the optical absorption begins at much lower energies in the icosahedral cluster as compared to the planar one, a fact which can be utilized in experiments to distinguish between the two geometries. At higher energies, both the isomers exhibit plasmon-like excitations. 73,1 4%</p>

    <p>Pariser-Parr-Pople (P-P-P) model Hamiltonian has been used extensively over the years to perform calculations of electronic structure and optical properties of $œÄ$-conjugated systems successfully. In spite of tremendous successes of \emph{ab initio} theory of electronic structure of large systems, the P-P-P model continues to be a popular one because of a recent resurgence in interest in the physics of $œÄ$-conjugated polymers, fullerenes and other carbon based materials. In this paper, we describe a Fortran 90 computer program developed by us, which uses P-P-P model Hamiltonian to not only solve Hartree-Fock (HF) equation for closed- and open-shell systems, but also for performing correlation calculations at the level of single configuration interactions (SCI) for molecular systems. Moreover, the code is capable of computing linear optical absorption spectrum at various levels, such as, tight binding (TB) Hueckel model, HF, SCI, and also of calculating the band structure using the Hueckel model. The code also allows the user to solve the HF equation in the presence of finite external electric field, thus, permitting calculations of quantities such as static polarizabilities and electro-absorption spectra. We demonstrate the capabilities of our code by performing calculations of various properties on conjugated systems such as $trans$-polyacetylene ($t$-PA), poly-\emph{para}-phenylene (PPP), poly-\emph{para}-phenylene-vinylene (PPV), \textit{oligo}-acenes, and graphene nanodisks.</p>

    <p>We use real-time reflection high energy electron diffraction intensity oscillation to establish the Te-rich growth dynamics of topological insulator thin films of Bi2Te3 on Si(111) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. In situ angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and ex situ transport measurements reveal that the as-grown Bi2Te3 films without any doping are an intrinsic topological insulator with its Fermi level intersecting only the metallic surface states. Experimentally, we find that the single-Dirac-cone surface state develops at a thickness of two quintuple layers (2 QL). Theoretically, we show that the interaction between the surface states from both sides of the film, which is determined by the penetration depth of the topological surface state wavefunctions, sets this lower thickness limit.</p>

    <p>We present a first-principles study of bare and hydrogen passivated armchair nanoribbons of the puckered single layer honeycomb structures of silicon and germanium. Our study includes optimization of atomic structure, stability analysis based on the calculation of phonon dispersions, electronic structure and the variation of band gap with the width of the ribbon. The band gaps of silicon and germanium nanoribbons exhibit family behavior similar to those of graphene nanoribbons. The edges of bare nanoribbons are sharply reconstructed, which can be eliminated by the hydrogen termination of dangling bonds at the edges. Periodic modulation of the nanoribbon width results in a superlattice structure which can act as a multiple quantum wells. Specific electronic states are confined in these wells. Confinement trends are qualitatively explained by including the effects of the interface. In order to investigate wide and long superlattice structures we also performed empirical tight binding calculations with parameters determined from \textit{ab initio} calculations.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We have studied, both experimentally and theoretically, the change of the so-called 2D band of the Raman scattering spectrum of graphene (the two-phonon peak near 2700 cm-1) in an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the graphene crystal plane at liquid helium temperature. A shift to lower frequency and broadening of this band is observed as the magnetic field is increased from 0 to 33 T. At fields up to 5--10 T the changes are quadratic in the field while they become linear at higher magnetic fields. This effect is explained by the curving of the quasiclassical trajectories of the photo-excited electrons and holes in the magnetic field, which enables us (i) to extract the electron inelastic scattering rate, and (ii) to conclude that electronic scattering accounts for about half of the measured width of the 2D peak.</p>

Our scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, complemented by tight binding calculations, reveal the presence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around each single graphite vacancy, which can be associated with the formation of local magnetic moments and implies a dramatic reduction of the charge carriers' mobility. While vacancies in single layer graphene naturally lead to magnetic couplings of arbitrary sign, our results show the possibility of inducing a macroscopic ferrimagnetic state in multilayered graphene samples just by randomly removing single C atoms.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The magnetization of the prototypical molecular magnet Mn12-acetate exhibits a series of sharp steps at low temperatures due to quantum tunneling at specific resonant values of magnetic field applied along the easy c-axis. An abrupt reversal of the magnetic moment of such a crystal can also occur as an avalanche, where the spin reversal proceeds along a "deflagration" front that travels through the sample at subsonic speed. In this article we review experimental results that have been obtained for the ignition temperature and the speed of propagation of magnetic avalanches in molecular nanomagnets. Fits of the data with the theory of magnetic deflagration yield overall qualitative agreement. However, numerical discrepancies indicate that our understanding of these avalanches is incomplete.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We demonstrate a new method of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) that is bulk sensitive, like traditional fluorescence yield measurements, but is not affected by self-absorption or saturation effects. This measure of XAS is achieved by scanning the incident photon energy through an absorption edge and using an energy sensitive photon detector to measure the partial fluorescence yield (PFY). The x-ray emission from any element or core-hole excitation that is not resonant with the absorption edge under investigation is selected from the PFY. It is found that the inverse of this PFY spectrum, which we term inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY), is linearly proportional to the x-ray absorption cross-section without any corrections due to saturation or self-absorption effects. We demonstrate this technique on the Cu L and Nd M absorption edges of the high-Tc cuprate LNSCO by measuring the O K PFY and comparing the total electron yield, total fluorescence yield and IPFY spectra.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>A self-consistent model is developed for the surface and bulk states of thin Y_{1-y}Ca_yBa_2Cu_3O_{7-Œ¥} (YCBCO) films. The dispersions of the chain and plane layers are modelled by tight-binding bands, and the electronic structure is then calculated for a finite-thickness film. The dopant atoms are treated within a virtual crystal approximation. Because YCBCO is a polar material, self-consistent treatment of the long range Coulomb interaction leads to a transfer of charge between the film surfaces, and to the formation of surface states. The tight binding band parameters are constrained by the requirement that the calculated band structure of surface states at CuO$_2$-terminated surfaces be in agreement with photoemission experiments. The spectral function and density of states are calculated and compared with experiments. Unlike the case of Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8, where the surfaces are believed to be representative of the bulk, the densities of states at the YCBCO surfaces are shown to be qualitatively different from the bulk, and are sensitive to doping. The calculated spectral function agrees closely with both bulk-sensitive and surface-sensitive photoemission results, while the calculated density of states for optimally-doped YCBCO agrees closely with tunneling experiments. We find that some density of states features previously ascribed to competing order can be understood as band structure effects.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Magnetic correlations in the paramagnetic phase of CaFe2As2 (T_N=172 K) have been examined by means of inelastic neutron scattering from 180 K (~ 1.05 T_N) up to 300 K (~1.8 T_N). Despite the first-order nature of the magnetic ordering, strong but short-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations are clearly observed. These correlations, which consist of quasi-elastic scattering centered at the wavevector Q_{AFM} of the low-temperature AFM structure, are observed up to the highest measured temperature of 300 K and at high energy transfer (E> 60 meV). The L dependence of the scattering implies rather weak interlayer coupling in the tetragonal c-direction corresponding to nearly two-dimensional fluctuations in the (ab) plane. The spin correlation lengths within the Fe layer are found to be anisotropic, consistent with underlying fluctuations of the AFM stripe structure. Similar to the cobalt doped superconducting BaFe2As2 compounds, these experimental features can be adequately reproduced by a scattering model that describes short-range anisotropic spin correlations with overdamped spin dynamics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>The shear rate dependence of the slip length in thin polymer films confined between atomically flat surfaces is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The polymer melt is described by the bead-spring model of linear flexible chains. We found that at low shear rates the velocity profiles acquire a pronounced curvature near the wall and the absolute value of the negative slip length is approximately equal to thickness of the viscous interfacial layer. At higher shear rates, the velocity profiles become linear and the slip length increases rapidly as a function of shear rate. The gradual transition from no-slip to steady-state slip flow is associated with faster relaxation of the polymer chains near the wall evaluated from decay of the time autocorrelation function of the first normal mode. We also show that at high melt densities the friction coefficient at the interface between the polymer melt and the solid wall follows power law decay as a function of the slip velocity. At large slip velocities the friction coefficient is determined by the product of the surface induced peak in the structure factor, temperature and the contact density of the first fluid layer near the solid wall.</p>

    <p>We present an approach for time-dependent quantum transport based on a self-consistent non-equilibrium Green function formalism. The technique is applied to a ballistic carbon nanotube transistor in the presence of a time harmonic signal at the gate. In the ON state the dynamic conductance exhibits plasmonic resonant peaks at terahertz frequencies. These vanish in the OFF state, and the dynamic conductance displays smooth oscillations, a signature of single particle quantum effects. We show that the nanotube kinetic inductance plays an essential role in the high-frequency behavior.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We report a direct current transport study of the local intergrain connections in a polycrystalline SmFeAsO0.85 (Sm1111) bulk, for which we earlier estimated significant intergranular critical current density Jc. Our combined low temperature laser scanning microscopy (LTLSM) and scanning electron microscopy observations revealed only few grain-to-grain transport current paths, most of which switched off when a magnetic field was applied. These regions typically occur where current crosses Fe-As, which is a normal-metal wetting-phase that surrounds Sm1111 grains, producing a dense array of superconducting-normal-superconducting contacts. Our study points out the need to reduce the amount of grain boundary-wetting Fe-As phase, as well as the crack density within pnictide grains, as these defects produce a multiply connected current-blocking network.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>We present an experimental and theoretical study of the magnetic field dependence of the mode frequency of thermally excited spin waves in rectangular shaped nanopillars of lateral sizes 60x100, 75x150, and 105x190 nm2, patterned from MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions. The spin wave frequencies were measured using spectrally resolved electrical noise measurements. In all spectra, several independent quantized spin wave modes have been observed and could be identified as eigenexcitations of the free layer and of the synthetic antiferromagnet of the junction. Using a theoretical approach based on the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix of a system of three coupled, spatially confined magnetic layers, we have modeled the spectra for the smallest pillar and have extracted its material parameters. The magnetization and exchange stiffness constant of the CoFeB free layer are thereby found to be substantially reduced compared to the corresponding thin film values. Moreover, we could infer that the pinning of the magnetization at the lateral boundaries must be weak. Finally, the interlayer dipolar coupling between the free layer and the synthetic antiferromagnet causes mode anticrossings with gap openings up to 2 GHz. At low fields and in the larger pillars, there is clear evidence for strong non-uniformities of the layer magnetizations. In particular, at zero field the lowest mode is not the fundamental mode, but a mode most likely localized near the layer edges.</p>
