    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In this work, we demonstrate the use of CQDs synthesized from lignin -
currently one of the most abundant and underutilized by-products of paper and
pulp production - for advanced pH monitoring applications. The presented
approach integrates green chemistry principles with an operator-friendly,
low-cost, and practical solution for spatial and temporal pH measurement. CQDs
functionalized with m-aminophenylboronic acid enable highly sensitive and
reversible pH readouts through two complementary mechanisms: ratiometric
monitoring of emission band intensities, and direct visual observation of
colorimetric changes reflected in the CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates. The
system achieves maximal sensitivities of 137 percent per pH unit and 49.5
percent per pH unit, respectively, while simultaneously maintaining high
measurement resolution and full reproducibility of the readouts, placing it
among the most effective CQD-based pH sensors reported to date. Here, we
demonstrate the capability of 2D luminescent imaging of pH distributions,
allowing for both spatially resolved and time-resolved monitoring. Employing
just an excitation source, a digital camera or smartphone, and RGB channel
analysis, the setup eliminates the necessity for specialized filters or
sophisticated instrumentation. The combination of multimodal readout strategies
with the capacity for large-area visualization establishes lignin-derived CQDs
as a sustainable and practical platform for pH sensing. By simultaneously
addressing the challenges of waste valorization and the demand for innovative
sensing technologies, this solution fulfills the requirements of both
environmentally responsible material design and next-generation pH sensor
development.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Machine learning has accelerated materials discovery, yet most
high-performing models remain black boxes, offering predictions without
physical understanding. Here I present GoodRegressor, a general-purpose,
C++-based symbolic regression framework that bridges data-driven modeling and
physical interpretability. GoodRegressor systematically explores nonlinear
transformations and feature interactions across five integrated modules,
parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer as a post-process, to
construct compact, physics-consistent analytical models. For example, applied
to the experimental activation energy dataset of oxygen-ion conductors,
GoodRegressor explored an ensemble-sampled model space comprising approximately
$1.44 \times 10^{457}$ possible combinations and achieved superior predictive
performance ($\langle R^2 \rangle =0.804$) compared with conventional machine
learning methods, outperforming RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, MLP,
and PySR ($\langle R^2 \rangle \leq 0.652$). Unlike black-box models,
GoodRegressor reveals transparent structure-property relationships linking
ionic transport to coordination environment and lattice flexibility. This
interpretable modeling framework mitigates the opacity of conventional ML,
enabling hypothesis generation, physical insight, and general applicability to
complex scientific systems beyond materials informatics.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be
found at https://github.com/ahnobari/OptimizeAnyTopology.</p>
