    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of
novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored
chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the
performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three
databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary
nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database
(constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally
perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are
less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions
involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we
assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in
performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is
attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we
refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future
developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the
limitations of diffusion models.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been
controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal
dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a
first-principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting
Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge
transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with
spin-triplet ground states and a zero-field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz
(THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple
to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as
high-fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz
ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher
temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward
the possibility of realising a single-photon THz emitter. This work broadens
the scope of quantum defects, highlighting the opportunities for next
generation THz quantum technologies - an area of growing interest given the
rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage
systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and
ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However,
measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain
experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a
unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a
forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both
computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive
molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately
estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation
structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance
and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration,
making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular
mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the
first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design,
demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports
multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently
multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we
experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic
conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework
advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other
complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>
