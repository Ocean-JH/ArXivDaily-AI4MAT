    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>This paper systematically reviews the research progress and application
prospects of machine learning technologies in the field of polymer materials.
Currently, machine learning methods are developing rapidly in polymer material
research; although they have significantly accelerated material prediction and
design, their complexity has also caused difficulties in understanding and
application for researchers in traditional fields. In response to the above
issues, this paper first analyzes the inherent challenges in the research and
development of polymer materials, including structural complexity and the
limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods. To address these problems,
it focuses on introducing key basic technologies such as molecular descriptors
and feature representation, data standardization and cleaning, and records a
number of high-quality polymer databases. Subsequently, it elaborates on the
key role of machine learning in polymer property prediction and material
design, covering the specific applications of algorithms such as traditional
machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning; further, it deeply
expounds on data-driven design strategies, such as reverse design,
high-throughput virtual screening, and multi-objective optimization. The paper
also systematically introduces the complete process of constructing
high-reliability machine learning models and summarizes effective experimental
verification, model evaluation, and optimization methods. Finally, it
summarizes the current technical challenges in research, such as data quality
and model generalization ability, and looks forward to future development
trends including multi-scale modeling, physics-informed machine learning,
standardized data sharing, and interpretable machine learning.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>In the rapidly advancing field of materials informatics, nonlinear machine
learning models have demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities for
material properties. However, their black-box nature limits interpretability,
and they may incorporate features that do not contribute to, or even
deteriorate, model performance. This study employs explainable ML (XML)
techniques, including permutation feature importance and the SHapley Additive
exPlanation, applied to a pristine support vector regression model designed to
predict band gaps at the GW level using 18 input features. Guided by
XML-derived individual feature importance, a simple framework is proposed to
construct reduced-feature predictive models. Model evaluations indicate that an
XML-guided compact model, consisting of the top five features, achieves
comparable accuracy to the pristine model on in-domain datasets (0.254 vs.
0.247 eV) while demonstrating superior generalization with lower prediction
errors on out-of-domain data (0.461 vs. 0.341 eV). Additionally, the study
underscores the necessity for eliminating strongly correlated features
(correlation coefficient greater than 0.8) to prevent misinterpretation and
overestimation of feature importance before applying XML. This study highlights
XML's effectiveness in developing simplified yet highly accurate machine
learning models by clarifying feature roles, thereby reducing computational
costs for feature acquisition and enhancing model trustworthiness for materials
discovery.</p>

    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Heat conduction and radiation are two of the three fundamental modes of heat
transfer, playing a critical role in a wide range of scientific and engineering
applications ranging from energy systems to materials science. However,
traditional physics-based simulation methods for modeling these processes often
suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In recent years, the rapid
advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in the modeling of nanoscale heat conduction
and radiation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent
AI-driven developments in modeling heat conduction and radiation at the
nanoscale. We first discuss the ML techniques for predicting phonon properties,
including phonon dispersion and scattering rates, which are foundational for
determining material thermal properties. Next, we explore the role of
machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics
simulations and their applications to bulk materials, low-dimensional systems,
and interfacial transport. We then review the ML approaches for solving
radiative heat transfer problems, focusing on data-driven solutions to
Maxwell's equations and the radiative transfer equation. We further discuss the
ML-accelerated inverse design of radiative energy devices, including
optimization-based and generative model-based methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions, including data availability, model
generalization, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Through this
survey, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of how AI techniques are
reshaping thermal science and guiding future research in nanoscale heat
transfer.</p>
