    <summary>Summary (Click to Expand)</summary>
    <p>Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of
amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune
features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to
specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the
structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent
bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs
have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated
inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified
in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse
design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the
simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much
stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the
mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across
a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable
parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our
formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter
changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability.
These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference
between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to
both understand and perform inverse design.</p>
